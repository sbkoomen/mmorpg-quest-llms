In order to open a path to Evernight, you must find a way through the Crevices of Dusk, cracks between the Prime Material Plane and the Shadowfell. To do that you require a necromantic lure.

As a result, the area near the tree is infused with an evil spiritual energy. Valindra's Thayan wizards have found a way to tap into this energy and are using it to fuel their rituals. Acolyte Neyman believes a ritual cleansing of the area will disperse the energy, but she will need a protector during the ceremony. Go and speak to her.

Not only does it protect our inland trade routes, but many of the city's spellscarred were sent to the sanatorium there for treatment. I need skilled adventurers to investigate the situation and defeat the cultists.

I've received orders from our leader, Florin Icehammer, that the time has come to retrieve our clan's treasure. A full frontal assault with our army will do no good, though.

With my rod, staff and wand near at hand I feel practically invincible! The array of useful spells at my fingertips is very nearly intoxicating, which makes it all the worse to have lost all three! I cannot believe I was so clumsy! I must have dropped the rod near the Merchant's Guild hall when I set it aside to barter. The wand must have slipped from my satchel along the road... And the staff, I know I had it with me when I stopped to rest on a rocky outcropping. Perhaps I left it there? As soon as I catch my breath, I must retrace my steps and find them. Hmm, what's that sound?

The tomb should be empty, of course, if Vars did settle in Waterdeep. But anything that I find in there should prove most interesting. Especially if records of his lineage were inscribed anywhere! The tomb is not far, but I would be grateful if you could clear it of any lingering dead.

But if you want some real dungeon delving advice you should speak to Armario Clavus down in the marketplace. You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Armario was a legendary dungeon explorer in his day. After he retired he became a master locksmith. His specialty is crafting keys capable of unlocking magically sealed dungeon chests. Maybe you should have a talk with him before you find yourself exploring a dungeon.

That's why we chose this area for our base of operations, despite the presence of an abandoned drow settlement nearby. Unfortunately the drow have returned and captured some of our scouts. We're working on a plan to save our imprisoned comrades. If you can find keys to the holding cells on the drow hunting in the area, we'll have a real shot at saving my people.

For years I've been on the hunt for a certain scholarly work. I discovered the tome was taken into the Underdark by a would-be explorer. Painstaking research leads me to believe the fellow met his end in Zesraena. I intended to search the rubbish heaps of Zesraena for our book, but I'm not as young as I was when we started this quest.

I would dearly love to have some samples of these mushrooms, but it will mean venturing into the drow settlement of Zesraena. The Drow encourage the growth of skullcaps, so there should be plenty of them growing in the town.

I have to believe that they're still alive in the drow slave pits. Now that preparations are complete, it's time to push back the drow and free our people! I'm counting on you, adventurer.

Dunmish was his name. According to the Captain, a recent calamity has left the region covered in a strange substance the locals call 'black ice'. Some say this black ice is a wondrous material capable of making incredible weapons and armor. Others say it is a curse on the land, corrupting the minds and hearts of every living thing it touches. Captain Dunmish is offering passage to heroes willing to brave the dangers of Icewind Dale. He's only taking the very best, though. Do you think you'll meet his standards?

We already know the drow are receiving weapons from the Duergar who work the nearby mines. Normally the drow do not see the Duergar as fit for anything but slavery, but I begin to suspect the grey dwarves are already enslaved to an even more deadly foe. We have Guides keeping watch over the Duergar mines. Make your way there and look for Jasper Steele. He'll fill you in on anything he's learned.

Without those cranes the ore will have to be hauled up on the back of the miners. It'll mean a big hit to their efficiency.

I think those weapons would be better off going to the Guild. If you gather up some of the weapon components the duergar are turnin' out, I'll see that you're rewarded for it. You'll like find the components near forges in the Crucible and some of the duergar are sure to be carryin' them as well.

In fact, I'd like a chance to get a better look at few of those alloys. While you're in the Crucible why not try to snatch up any alloy samples you can. I'd be might pleased if you did.

Apparently only one duergar has been there and returned: the Forge Master of the Wrathforge. He's a master smith and overseer that the flayers either trust or control completely.

We need to find some defense against the power of these stones. I've inscribed several Mind Blank spells upon this scroll. Although the spell is intended to prevent others from reading your mind, I suspect it may also have the power to neutralize the resonance stones.

Messandar was well-respected in Neverwinter and his funeral was well-attended. It's only a matter of time until one of these ghosts gives up the goods. It it wasn't for the devastation the spell plague caused here, I'm sure they would have already found him. My contacts in Protector's Enclave have furnished me with a list of Messandar's closest associates who are now interred here.

In addition to this mass sacrifice, the cult has five sacrificial victims they have specially prepared for this ritual, one for each of Tiamat's heads. They're keeping them prisoner in some nearby cave in the Well of Dragons. Please, for their sake, head into the Cult Prison and rescue those sacrificial victims!

The blasted thieves plan to offer it all to Tiamat as tribute when she arises. To make matters worse, this added show of faith and support in the dragon goddess will only strengthen her. We need to reclaim as much of the treasure as possible in order to weaken the cultists' summoning ritual. Bring it back to me, and I'll make sure it gets delivered back to those from whom it was taken. If ye also happen to thrash any cultists or Thayans while you're out there, it will only make our fight easier when the time comes to face Tiamat.

They have allied with the Red Wizards of Thay to perform a ritual with the intent of raising the evil dragon goddess, Tiamat, from the depths of the Nine Hells. Needless to say, the return of the five-headed Dragon Queen would be catastrophic to all of Faerûn. You should speak with Harper Boward.

All the while, they've been raiding towns up and down the Sword Coast, amassing a vast hoard of treasure, and taking prisoners. According to our information, this all leads to one conclusion: Severin is planning a ritual to summon the dragon goddess, Tiamat from the Nine Hells! This is a matter that concerns all of Faerûn. Elminster himself is calling upon representatives from all over to meet him at the Well of Dragons. We could also use any support we can get from heroic adventurers like yourself. Journey to the Well of Dragons and speak with Eminster. We'll meet you there. Your part in this will truly decide the fate of Faerûn.

If the Ashmadai use their profane rituals to desecrate them, the shields could be transformed into powerful artifacts of evil. The shields must be recovered before that can come to pass. The crypts are marked by stone towers in the forests north and east of Helm's Hold. I would suggest you start your search there.

That gives me an idea that may slow them down a bit. There is a certain plant growing abundantly in this area called gurglewort. The plant has beautiful blooms, but the sap in its stalks causes... Internal distress to anyone unfortunate enough to ingest it. Collect gurglewort sap and add it to the crates of fish the humanoids have stockpiled in their underground lairs. That should render a good many of them unfit for combat.

Unfortunately, Yolander was killed in the creatures initial attack and we didn't think to collect his books. I'd like you to take a symbol from one of the aquatic humanoids and compare it to images in the book. You should still be able to find it in the camp where the sage was killed.

The creatures have established strong points in the nearby Silver Drip and Glimmerstone mines. I fear we may not be able to maintain this foothold against another attack, from the humanoids, but if you were to reduce the number of enemies gathering in the mines our chances would improve.

While the cultists inside the pumps work to figure out the mechanism, and coerce the dwarves into divulging their secrets, they have sent some cultists out to sabotage the pipes, knowing we will need to stop them before mounting our attack.

The Cistern is a place where the  dwarves summon the water elementals used to keep Maegera slumbering. The pumps' mechanism can only be operated by a dwarf of the Delzoun bloodline, and it so happens that Vanifer has kidnapped a number of the dwarves who were foolish enough to return to their homes and businesses. If the supply of elementals should be stopped, Maegera would awake with tragic consequences. Stop Vanifer!

If disrupted, it breaks the cultists' connection with the Elemental Plane of Air. Take this cleansing incense and go to the Altar of Yan-C-Bin. Add the incense to the braziers that burn there, cleansing the air of corrupted elemental energies.  Be careful though: the Howling Hatred is protective of their altar to Yan-C-Bin.

It could be that Vansi Bloodscar has somehow discovered how to deliberately afflict her warriors with spellscars, however reckless that plan would clearly be.

When used in combat the enchantment will gradually lose its charge until it fades away. You may return here at any time for a new one... for a nominal fee, of course. As the guild's Stronghold grows, I will have a wider array of more powerful enchantments available, so make sure to keep an eye on the marketplace.

Remember, your targets this time are all horrible, disreputable, pact-breakers, and one hundred percent rotten, even to devilish standards - so, not like you at all.

In addition, the normal dangers in the area - barbarians, trolls, bears, remorhazes - grow stronger and more violent the longer they are exposed to black ice. Black ice seems like a curse, but some local artisans have learned to fashion it into weapons and armor far more powerful than your Sword Coast trinkets. So what do you think? This is your last chance to back out. Care to try your skills in the unforgiving wilderness of Icewind Dale?

Plenty of adventurers have shown up here, brashly ran off into the hinterlands in search of black ice, never to be heard from again. Black ice is a powerful substance, but lust for it can make you... well, reckless, for one. Before you start gathering your fortune, there are a few local business owners you should meet. These are the people who will pour your drinks, repair your armor, and pack your supplies. You'll want to cultivate a reputation for integrity, reliability, and generosity with these folks. If you can do that, you're fortune is half made already. Swing by the Hook, Line, and Sinker, and talk to Eglendar, the bartender there. He's a good man to know.

Being the accommodating fellow that I am, I have arranged for a solution to these conflicts. I let representatives of each faction recruit adventurers such as yourself here in town, for a nominal fee to the, er... Town coffers, of course. Bowen Brant has come from the city of Bryn Shander to represent the interests of the Ten-Towns, and Anara the Cerulean is here from Luskan to represent the Arcane Brotherhood. You should speak to each of them to learn who you'd prefer to work with. Of course, the contract you accept is only temporary, so you could always work for the other faction at a later time.

You have to attack its supply lines. And in this case, that's the ritual components that the Thayans use to reanimate corpses. It's called black onyx, and the Thayans mine it in the Quarry to the east. The Red Wizards know how vulnerable their supply lines are here, and they put up magical barriers around any rich black onyx deposits the servitors dig up. You'll have to rough up some Thayans to put together a token that you can use to pierce the barriers. Once you have the token, just use this Rod of Shattering on the deposits to break 'em apart. Stop the Thayans from mining black onyx, and you stop the undead army.

To create their Shadowfell-influenced illusions, the Red Wizard illusionists collect Shadowfell energy in large Shadow Collectors, which they attune with trinkets they call 'prismatic resonators.' Our scouts have seen a Shadow Collector become unstable and overload when too many of these resonators are used on it at once. That's exactly what we need you to do -- collect resonators from the Thayans and use them to destroy their Shadow Collectors.

The Red Wizard illusionists weave energy from the Shadowfell into their spells, infusing their phantasms with a powerful robustness. If we could unravel the rituals that they use to create them... When these physical phantasms are disrupted, they may leave behind a residue. If you could provide me with enough samples, I may be able to identify the exact spells the Thayans are using and research a way to counter them.

Whether from the Ring itself, from the cursed bones of Lorragauth, or from the Thayans themselves I know not, but dark magic is so pervasive here that I and the other clerics must spend a great deal of effort maintaining a protective barrier around our camp, lest the Vanguard becomes stricken with disease and malady. Yet, the Red Wizards within the Ring are still among the living. They protect themselves from the baleful influence by carrying protective wards. We can use those wards to hinder the Thayan undead creation engine. Take these protective wards from Red Wizards you encounter and place them near piles of coffins. That will prevent the bodies inside those coffins from being raised.

They use the black onyx they mine there for necromantic rituals that fuel their undead armies. That's why the Thayans guard the Quarry with a savage weapon: Dread Hounds. Specially-trained howlers, augmented with Red Wizard magic. Our troops wouldn't stand a chance. To have a hope of successfully attacking the Quarry, the Dread Hounds need to be silenced. Raid that area and take out as many as you can find.

Even as we speak, hordes of undead are hard at work unearthing and piecing together the dragon's skeletal remains. We must do all that we can to hamper their efforts. The primary excavation site is within Lorragauth's rib cage. The area swarms with undead excavators. Go there and cut a swath through them in order to slow down their operation. The Thayans will just raise more corpses of course, but doing so will cost them time and resources, and as long as the Vanguard is here the Thayans have an infinite supply of neither.

Because of that, the inside of the Ring is poorly fortified and their supply caches are woefully undefended. The Red Wizard illusionists in Underwing stash their supplies in shallow caves and cast basic illusory walls to hide them. You'll find torches near these walls, and touching the torches will dispel the illusion. Get into those caves and destroy the Thayan supplies!

The rifts are small enough so that only beings of minor power may traverse them, but they allow armies of imps to flood continuously into this world. No doubt this is part of the bargain that the Thayans made with their infernal allies. The rifts, luckily, are weak enough so that they may be collapsed by simply disrupting their physical form. You must go and close these rifts, or the number of imps in the Dread Ring may become too great for us to handle.

The Red Wizard evokers have crafted a most powerful weapon -- a Sphere of Annihilation! Anything that touches the Sphere is instantly obliterated, which makes disposing of such a weapon very dangerous. The Red Wizards' contingency plan should the Sphere become too dangerous to contain is to destroy it with a Rod of Cancellation. The Rod is separated into three pieces. If you can assemble those pieces of the Rod and throw it into the Sphere, it will be destroyed in a catastrophic explosion! Ah... the containment apparatus the Thayans have constructed to hold the Sphere of Annihilation should contain the blast. I am confident that you will remain unharmed.

One way we do this is by disrupting the Red Wizard conjurers' attempts to summon further aid from the Nine Hells. You could greatly aid our disruptive efforts if you could bring us the residue left behind by any devils you defeat. As extra-planar beings, their remnants can be quite powerful when used as ritual components for summoning magics, or in this case, anti-summoning magics.

Zombies don't sleep, don't eat, don't die easily, don't get scared, and don't stop single-mindedly following orders. That's just it though -- for a delicate task like maintaining the magical weapons stored in the Arsenal, the Thayans can't use clumsy undead. They need living, breathing, thinking people working on it. We need you to take on the Thayan Servitors in that area. They're exatly the living, breathing, thinking people I was just talking about, and we need to harry their operations to buy ourselves more time. Magical weapons are dangerous and need a lot of looking after. Without enough Servitors, the weapons will be in no shape to be used against us.

The Thayans have set up a big rock grinder at the excavation site to dispose of all the extra stone they dig up.

The items are simple enough so that even the mindless undead excavators can use them. This is our chance to use these Red Wizards' arrogance against them. If you gathered a couple entire crates of these stones and tossed them down the primary excavation shaft, I imagine it would set their operations back by a bit.

We Battlehammer dwarves are few enough in number; we don't need trolls coming in and whittling us down further. Head to the Daledrop Vale in Dwarven Valley. Maybe you can save some of my dwarves, and if not, at least you can punish those vicious trolls.

Small amounts have made their way into the hands of our citizens, and I believe it has made them vulnerable to Kessell's influence. A handful of people have reported to me that they've woken up half way to Dwarven Valley, shaking free of a dream that they were marching to war. Even more people are missing, and I fear they are wandering towards the Shattered Hollow where Kessell waits to embrace them in his deathless service. Search the Hollow for Ten-Towners, and wake them from their slumber before it's too late. I must remain here and find out who is passing around this impure black ice. Doubtless, some Arcane Brotherhood lackey is behind this.

Frequent blizzards have caused many a poor soul to be devoured by hungry beasts or die of exposure. The dwarves who settled the region established a series of beacons along the main road to guide travelers in foul weather. Marvelous as they are, these beacons need to be refueled from time to time. We've learned the fiery bile of a creature known as a remorhaz makes an excellent, long-burning fuel for the beacons. Luckily, a friendly Elk Tribe scout has reported a dead remorhaz in Icewind Pass. If you draw bile from the carcass, you can use it to refill the beacons. After filling a beacon, a simple push on the striker lever should ignite it.

The Icereaver Clan has taken to leaving offerings of black ice beneath the stones of these cairns, and somehow this is causing the dead to rise! Undead giants have recently been spotted outside our town gates. We must put an end to this evil! As luck would have it, there is a priest of Kelemvor visiting the town. If anyone will know how to stop the undead, he will. Look for him in the Hook, Line and Sinker.

I'm tired of losing good people and good merchandise to these brutes. If the only thing they understand is violence, we should send an appropriate message! Hunt down frost giants in Biggrin's Rest.

They seem to grant enhanced strength in battle, but not through any traditional form of arcane or divine magic. This leads us to believe black ice may be involved somehow. It seems improbable that these savages have discovered properties of the black ice that have eluded our best minds, but it might pay to explore the possibility. I want you to go out and capture several Bear Tribe axes. Best be on your guard however, those barbarians are not easily parted from their weapons.

But the pelts of these beasts can be used to create enchanted cloaks that ward off the effects of even the most intense cold. Many of the Arcane Brotherhood members gathered here in Icewind Dale hail from much warmer climes, so winter wolf cloaks are in high demand among us. Alas, the enchantment soon wears out, consuming the pelt in the process - so there is a constant need for more. If you hunt winter wolves and bring us their pelts we will compensate you accordingly.

With the recent eruptions of black ice, their aggression has increased ten-fold. They are attacking anyone who dares to hazard the road through Icewind Pass. The barbarians must be quelled before they bring fire and sword to our very doorsteps! They are using Galebreak Divide in Icewind Pass as a staging area for their attacks. Go there and take the battle to them.

Enchanted picks helped us dig, while complex assemblies of gears, levers, and winches hauled out the ice. We cannot let them continue to collect such a terrible and powerful material. Maybe you can solve two problems at once. Go to the Valley's Heart and collect as many of those enchanted picks as you can carry. Throw them into the mining mechanisms around there to jam up the gears. If they can't mine the stuff easily, maybe they'll give up.

They have become violent and cruel, and I fear that they are too far gone to save. The longer they are out there, serving whatever dark purpose that taints their souls, the more innocent lives will be lost. Slay those corrupted dwarves before all of Ten-Towns fall to their rage.

Many of the corrupted dwarves in the Dwarven Valley still carry these trinkets. If we learn the secrets of these objects, we may better understand what is happening in the Valley. Unfortunately, the only way you're going to be able to get your hands on that jewelry is to take it from a corrupted dwarf. I expect they'll put up a fight. Don't let that stop you, though. When you have enough, I'll open a pocket of extradimensional space where we can safely store these objects until we are prepared to examine them.

A miner surrounded on all sides by black ice, breathing it in through the dust, will become irreversibly changed. You must collapse these passages. The Arcane Brotherhood would just send more fools into them get at their precious black ice, but the cost to the Ten-Towns would be too high. Bury the passages beneath rock and snow so they will never infect another soul. The corrupted dwarves will not be pleased, so stay alert.

Its venom won't kill you, but it'll make it feel like your blood's burning you from the inside out, so it's an effective non-lethal method of disabling someone. A little goes a long way, so could you bring me back some?

The future is not certain and I catch glimpses of numerous, and often contradictory, events. The one thing I can say with some certainty is momentous events are coming to Neverwinter and the Sword Coast and you are a central figure in them.

We tend to be fairly secretive and create our shrines in out-of-the-way libraries and scriptoriums. The reason I moved to such a public place is to seek help in locating the Staff of Savras. There was once a group known as the Benign Order of the Third Eye. They received a direct vision from Savras, instructing them to stockpile magic items and weaponry for a coming war with Cyric. My research shows some of those stockpiles may contain clues to the location of the staff. The problem is, locating the Order's caches requires a working scrying orb built by a member of the Order. There was a battle, massacre really, in what is now the Tower District. Members of the Order were attacked and wiped out by followers of Cyric. If you can find fragments of the seers' orbs and return them to me, we may be able to reassemble a working orb. Look for shattered orbs on the ground and check any orcs you defeat, as well. They do so love shiny objects.

The process needs to be done in an area with Spellplague energy, but not too much, because it could fry you. That rules out the Chasm or tapping directly into Gyrion's portal.

The situation is very fluid, so you may need to recover a guard post and dig site from the enemy. Take these Reclaimed Weapons with you. Use some to get yourself a map of the local sewers. The rest can be used to reactivate an abandoned guard post or reinforce an active one.

We urgently need to build shelters to get these people out of the cold, but frost goblins have been harassing our lumberjacks and there is no wood. Stop the goblin raiders so we can rebuild our supplies of lumber and firewood. We also need hides to make clothing and tents. If you encounter any of the hostile frost wolves or polar bears that befoul these forests, bring back their hides.

If the constructs are being sent here, Trobriand must be working with the cultists in some way. We need to find out what they are doing and put an end to it.

Based on the way she begged not to go down there, I'm guessing she hid from her responsibilities. Belora was her name, I believe... pretty little thing. Our shadow dragon hasn't had fresh meat in some time, and he grows insufferable. When you have disposed of Belore, be sure to feed her remains to Umbraxakar.

It just so happens that I could use your assistance. Are you familiar with the Weave? It is the raw material from which the tapestry of magic itself is woven. The great Mystra, Mother of all Magic, watches over it. Whether a spell intends to heal, harness the elements, or call forth the undead, it pulls from the Weave. That brings me to my request. I've sensed someone or something tugging at the Weave, more specifically the necromantic magic it contains. While I cannot see all ends, there are others who see more than I do. Kavatos Stormeye can see many ends, and I believe he may know what is unwinding the threads of necromancy. I suggest you speak with a few citizens along the way and see if they've seen anyone suspicious. Oh, and please give Kavatos my regards.
