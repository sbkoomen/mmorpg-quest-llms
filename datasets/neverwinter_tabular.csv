Now they have turned their backs on Uthgar but still use his storm magic. They must be punished! Slay the Stormcallers on Thunder Ridge and take the rattles they use to channel their elemental magic! You are not blessed by Uthgar, so you must first speak with the wizard staying in our camp.
Stealing Thunder^39^Diana Fairwinds^Vellosk^Diana Fairwinds^Vellosk^^^Place Diana's orb in an empty spot in Thunder Ridge.^It's good to see someone else from the city. I feel very much alone among wolves in this place. Perhaps you can assist me in a task? The Stormcallers nearby in Thunder Ridge use their totems to magnify their command over thinger and lightning. I would like to study the ambient magical energy in that area, but I can't get close myself. Take this orb and place it in Thunder Ridge somewhere out of sight and it will absorb the energies and transfer it back to this orb here.
Ruins of the Fallen^5^Kyrn Whitesky^Vellosk^Kyrn Whitesky^Vellosk^Sacred Meeting^Lightning Strikes, Voice of Thunder^Kill Bandits in Xin'kar Ruins.^The bandits hiding in Xin'kar Ruins to the west have no respect for the Uthgardt ways.

Slay the bandits!
Relic of the Past^5^Kyrn Whitesky^Vellosk^Kyrn Whitesky^Vellosk^Sacred Meeting^Lightning Strikes, Voice of Thunder^Recover the Uthgardt Relic from the Xin'kar Enclave.^When the Gray Wolf Tribe submitted to the Netherese, we lost much of our old ways. Worship of Uthgar was replaced by worship to the dark Netherese god Shar. Shrines to the Battle Father were abandoned, and sacred relics lost. The Forsworn are trying to reclaim the old ways. We once had a sacred relic here at the Sacred Pool, but the bandits hiding out in the Xin'kar Enclave stole it away. Recover the Uthgardt relic from the Xin'kar Enclave and return it to me.
Sacred Meeting^5^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Kyrn Whitesky^Vellosk^Ancient Heritage, Hungry Like the Wolves, The Dark Hunter^Relic of the Past, Ruins of the Fallen^Meet with Kyrn Whitesky under the waterfall at the Sacred Pool^I said to you before that a shaman foretold your coming. Now that you have proven your strength and honor it is time you meet with him. Take the path north from the Forsworn Camp, past the Hunter's Path. Beyond is the Sacred Pool. Behind the waterfall you will find Kyrn Whitesky, a Forsworn shaman.
Seeking the Spirit^6^Kyrn Whitesky^Vellosk^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Lightning Strikes, Voice of Thunder^Whisperer in Darkness^Meet with Dying Howl at the Battle Father Shrine in by taking a spirit journey.^It is time to take the battle to the heart of the enemy. Deep within the Gray Wolf Battle Camp is an ancient shrine to Uthgar, the Battle Father. As the Netherese push the Gray Wolves to the worship of Shar, the Uthgar shrine has become neglected. To the west you will find the Battle Father Shrine and a primal spirit of our tribe known as Dying Howl. He will guide you further, but to reach him you must become closer to the spirits of this forest. I will aid you on this path of the spirits and you will have an awakening. I hope you are ready to awaken.
Whisperer in Darkness^6^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Seeking the Spirit^Masters In Twilight, The Shadow Falls^Collect a Netherese Orb and Soul Shards from the Gray Wolf Battle Camp.^The Netherese are foul plague upon this world, corrupting everything they touch. They have cursed the Gray Wolf Tribe, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters. We mush find what the Netherese intend to do with their werewolf slaves. The Shadovar Emissaries use the Netherese Orbs powered by Soul Shards to communicate orders from the Prince of Shadow. Head into the Gray Wolf Battle Camp east pf the Battle Father's Shrine. Search in and around the tents. Recover an Orb and Soul Shards, then return to me.
Masters In Twilight^6^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Whisperer in Darkness^The High Road^Kill Shadar-Kai in Twilight Reach.^These Netherese seek to enslave any who oppose them! The Shadovar masters plot and scheme in Twilight Reach - they must be destroyed! Follow the path north and west from the Battle Father Shrine. In Twilight Reach you will find many of the Shadar-Kai. Show them we will not tolerate their foul presence!
The Shadow Falls^6^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Dying Howl^Vellosk^Whisperer in Darkness^The High Road^Kill Markela Whispersoul in the Shadowkeeper's Temple.^The Netherese Orb you recovered spoke of a shadar-kai priestess named Markela Whispersoul. She oversees the nearby Shadowkeeper's Temple, a place dedicated to the worship of the Netherese goddess Shar. Markela seeks to turn the Graywolf Tribe from the worship of the Uthgar to that of Shar. This canno be allowed to happen! Take the path east and north of the Battle Father's shrine. Follow it northwards, then take the west path into Twilight Reach. Enter the Shadowkeeper's Temple and kill Markela Whispersoul!

They have proven themselves in battle time and again emerged victorious. It's the Packmasters who made the deal with the Netherese, corruptingg the spirit of our Tribe into a twisted mockery of its former self. They must be punished for leading the Gray Wolf Tribe astray! Enter Elder Rock to the north of High Camp. You will find the Packmasters there.

But we must finish this fight ourselves. It's time for you to return to the city from whence you came. Many thanks to you, <name>!
Check the Job Board^1^Well-Informed Barmaid in Driftwood Tavern^^^^^^Go investigate the job board inside the Driftwood Tavern.^Behind you, on the far wall, is a job board. You may have seen it when you came in here - It is just like all of the numerous job boards that seem to spring up wherever adventurers gather. Job boards are a useful place to check out rumors that adventurers, like yourself, want investigated. My rumors are local, while the job board postings span all of the city and even the entire Sword Coast. Why don't you go and see for yourself what the job board has posted.
Charthraxis^26^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^^Cult Communications^Defeat Charthraxis.^The new Cultists have been busy recruiting new dragons into their service. The Cultists in Neverdeath have convinced Charthraxis, a foul-tempered green dragon, to aid them here. Defeating Charthraxis may buy us some time to learn more about what the new cult is up to.
Tarmalune Trade Bars^1^^^Tarmalune Trade Bar Merchant^Protector's Enclave^^^Travel to Protector's Enclave in Neverwinter and discover what you can spend your trade bars on by speaking to the Trade Bar Merchant^It seems you've gotten your hands on a trade bar, a precious metal ingot minted for the express purpose of being used as a currency by merchants performing large transactions. The ubiquitous currency is used widely throughout the Faerun and if memory serves, a trade bar merchant in the Seven Suns Coster Market has all manner of wares for sale. Perhaps it might be a good idea to pay him a visit.
Dwarven Valley^70^Dwarven Valley Map^^Lodos Battlehammer^Dwarven Valley^^^Speak to Stokely Silverstream, Rory Hammerstone, Jubal Oakstaff, and Kinnera Foxwood in Caer-Konig, then explore the Dwarven Valley in Icewind Dale.^You now have a map detailing the path to the Dwarven Valley. Speak to Stokely Silverstream, Rory Hammerstone, Jubal Oakstaff, and Kinnera Foxwood about quests you can complete in the Dwarven Valley.
The Hammerstone Queen^70^Hammerstone Hammer^^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^^^Use the Hammerstone Hammer to summon and defeat the Queen of Hammerstone, then report to Stokely Silverstream in Caer-Konig.^This hammer may, when used to strike a ceremonial anvil somewhere beneath Dwarven Valley, call forth the Queen of Hammerstone, leader of the corrupted dwarves. If you defeat her, Stokely Silverstream will reward you handsomely.
Ancient Curiosity^4^Ancient Curio^^Disheveled Madman^Protector's Enclave^^^Take the ancient curio you discovered to the Disheveled Madman in Protector's Enclave^There are rumors of a Disheveled Madman living in Protector's Enclave who has a great interest in objects like the Ancient Curio you just discovered. If these rumors are true, he may even have powerful magic items to trade for these odd objects.
Ancient Advice^60-70^Chest in Adventurers of the Lost Artifact^^Bradda the Sage^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Sage Bradda to Decipher the Ancient Cult of the Dragon Scroll^You search through the chest and find various odds and ends belonging the Dragon Empire. Nothing really of note, as most of it has been burnt or melted, but a scroll made out of an unknown paper has survived. You try to read the scroll, but it is written in an unknown language. Perhaps a sage learned in ancient artifacts may be able to decipher this scroll.
An Eminent Guest at the Jubilee^4^^^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Meet Elminster at the event podium in Protector's Enclave^Rumor has it the mysterious Sage of Shadowdale, Elminster Aumar himself, is in the city of Neverwinter. The same rumors also say he's here to ask the aid of the city's heroes.
Defeating Dragons^26^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^^^Defeat a Cult Dragon in Neverdeath, Icespire Peak, Rothé Valley, Ebon Downs, or Whispering Cavern^Although the Cult of the Dragon has many powerful members, its true strength lies with the dragons it recruits. If you encounter any of these dragons while battling the Cult, you should make their defeat a priority.
Death Wizards^70^Zarifrax's Phylactery^^Zarifrax's Phylactery^^Necromancer Consultancy^Cult of Orcus^Collect Black Gems and a Bone Focus from Red Wizards in the Dread Ring.^So you require assistance from the Great and Powerful Zarifrax to find your way to Evernight? I was rather enjoying my rest until you showed up. But yes, I suppose I could assist you. We can discuss payment later... In order to open a path to Evernight, you must find a way through the Crevices of Dusk, cracks between the Prime Material Plane and the Shadowfell. To do that you require a necromantic lure. Fortunately for you I know how to make one. The Red Wizards of the Dread Ring have been mining obsidian shards for spells and carving them into black gems. A wizard I knew from long ago named Telimon oversees quarry operations there, and possesses a bone focus I have always admired. Bring me black gems from Red Wizards and the bone focus from Telimon and I will guide you in crafting the object you seek!
Cult of Orcus^70^Zarifrax's Phylactery^^Zarifrax's Phylactery^^Death Wizards^Descent into Shadow^Talk to Grazilaxx in Mantol-Derith. Then retrieve an Orcus Talisman from the Demon Cult Caves in the Underdark.^The denizens of Evernight do not care for the presence of mortals in their domain unless they pay the proper tribute. As tough as you think you are you cannot take on a whole city of undead. I know something that the ruling Tribunal of Evernight wants, and I can show you how to get it. I heard of the recent demonic invasion of the Underdark. Orcus cultists possess many valuable ceremonial items dedicated to the Demon Prince of Undeath. A Talisman of Orcus would be a fitting tribute for the Tribunal. The trouble will be finding the location of the demon cultists. Fortunately, a mind flayer named Grazilaxx owes me a favor. Go to Mantol-Derith and speak with Grazilaxx about the cultist caves. Tell him the Great and Powerful Zarifrax sent you!
Descent into Shadow^70^Zarifrax's Phylactery^^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Cult of Orcus^The Shard of Night^Retrieve Zarifrax's Coffer from his hidden cache in the Neverdeath Graveyard. Then set the Necromantic Lure to open the portal to Evernight. Enter the portal and acquire the Key of Night.^You follow instructions well, mortal! We nearly have everything we need to begin our descent into the Shadowfell! The final piece is something I can provide for you myself. Long ago I hid a coffer within the Neverdeath graveyard. We'll need it to enter the city of Evernight. Once you retrieve the coffer, I will guide you to one of the Crevices of Dusk. There you will place the Necromantic Lure and open a Shadowfell portal to Evernight. Once we arrive, give the coffer to Gatekeeper Arkwright. Do not tarry, for what we desire is close at hand!
Ruined District^^Kavatos Stormeye^^^^The Missing Link^^Visit each neighborhood: Riverfront, Tainted Grove, Realm's Edge, Ember Hollow. Defeat 10 enemies in each neighborhood.^The idiot Nashers who still believe their true king will come for them hold the Riverfront. They have been reinforced by Mintarn mercenaries who threw a tantrum when their pay was a few days late. To the east, Nostura and her twisted fey control the Tainted Grove. Gyrion's aberrants hold Realm's Edge in the southeast. Kabal and his metal minions hold sway over Ember Hollow due south of here. If I'm going to put together any sort of strategy I need more information! I wouldn't use the scouting reports I've got to wipe myself, much less use them for planning. I need numbers and capabilities!
Into the Wolf Den^42^Hadrik Longtooth^Vellosk^^Gray Wolf Den^Leaders of the Pack, Moonlight & Shadow^^Enter the Gray Wolf Den.^The greatest of the Gray Wolf Tribe is the bloodthirsty and greedy Ethraniev Marrowslake. It's she who swore the blood oath to Clariburnus Tanthul, the Prince of Shade, to lead our people against the Thayans. It's because of her our people suffer and die in a pointless war. Marrowslake sits high above us in the maw at the top of the Gray Wolf Den. Enter that ancient place of power and slay her!
The Trail of the Crown^6^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^Finding Honor^Seeking a Suspect^Meet with Private Hawthidon in the Blacklake District^If Gothwan's gone into Blacklake District, that's going to be trouble. Blacklake District is a mess, and I'm not just talking about the sludge from the lake. The Nasher rebels are openly defying Gothwan is still in Blacklake, Hawthidon will know about it.
Seeking a Suspect^6^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^The Trail of the Crown^The Dead Rats^Search Gothwan's known hangouts for clues to his current whereabouts.^Our best hope for finding Karzov and the stolen Crown lies with the Nasher cutpurse Gothwan Cooper who took part of the theft. I've marked a few of his known haunts on your map. Investigate those areas, and see if you can turn up some clue to where he may be hiding.
Preying on the Poor^6^Elmira^Blacklake District^Elmira^Blacklake District^^^Recover Stolen Goods from the Nashers.^The Nashers claim to be revolutionaries, but they're just another street gang! They steal from the poor, claiming it's to overthrow a tyrant, but all they really want is to line their own pockets! Well, no more. I've still got a little coin, and I'll pay you well to recover some of the things they've stolen from us.
The Dead Rats^6^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^Seeking a Suspect^Nashing of Teeth, Hot on the Trail^Raid the Dead Rats' hideout to find Gothwan Cooper and learn where Karzov is hiding.^We aren't the only ones who want Gothwan to reveal the location of Karzov and the Crown. A gang of wererat thieves, known as the Dead Rats, caught wind of his involvement and kidnapped him. The Nashers abandoned Gothwan to his fate, so if you can rescue him he will likely tell us everything he knows. The Dead Rats lair in the sewers here sic. I'll mark a known entry on your map, but be careful. Gothwan is no doubt being kept deep within their nest.
Signs of Life^1^^Neverwinter Fields^Lt. Linkletter^Neverwinter Fields^^Battlefield Triage^Equip yourself and heal up at Linkletter's Campfire.^Your ship was attacked by a dracolich as it entered Neverwinter's harbor and sank. You recover consciousness lying on the beach beneath the city's south wall.
Battlefield Triage^1^Lt. Linkletter^Neverwinter Fields^Dell McCourt^Neverwinter Fields^Signs of Life^Broken Arrow^Give First Aid to the Wounded Soldiers on the Battlefield.^Although we stopped Valindra's main force, the battle is far from over. The battlefield is crawling with mindless undead who lost their masters in the fighting. To make matters worse the enemy is raising our dead to use against us! Acolyte Neyman is performing a ritual of Kelemvor to lay the newly dead to rest. That is sure to draw an attack here. I must stay and make sure Neyman finishes her ritual. Could you search the battlefield for any wounded we missed and send them here? After you finish with the wounded, go to Dell McCourt's camp and tell him our situation.
Broken Arrow^1^Dell McCourt^Neverwinter Fields^Private Hawthidon^Neverwinter Fields^Battlefield Triage^Sleeping Dragon Bridge^Collect Arrows from the battlefield.^I'm afraid I have a gruesome task for ye. We've driven Valindra's main army off, but her Red Wizard allies are still harassing us with summoned undead. Private Hawthidon is trying to drive them off with his archers, but they're short on ammo. Search the battlefield and scavenge some arrows from the dead, then take them to Hawthidon.
Rags to Riches^4^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sleeping Dragon Bridge^The Theft of the Crown^Get Fashion Clothing from the Supply Sergeant.^I understand you lost quite a few of your belongings when the ship you were on was destroyed by the dracolich. I can't offer you much, but I can supply you with some off-duty clothing. I'm sure you're going to want to relax and get out of your combat gear at some point. Talk to Supply Sergeant Quinn. He's just west of here through that tunnel. He'll get you sorted out.
Sleeping Dragon Bridge^1^Private Hawthidon^Neverwinter Fields^^Protector's Enclave^Broken Arrow^Rags to Riches^Kill Undead Soldiers. Go to Sleeping Dragon Bridge.^More undead are attacking Neverwinter! They are boiling out of Red Wizards. Please go to the bridge and aid the defenders! Destroy the Undead Soldiers near the gate to our north so it may be opened safely. Then talk to Tempus grant you strength!
Vital Supplies^4^Corporal Benton^Protector's Enclave^Corporal Benton^Driftwood Tavern^^^Collect Luskan Ale, Sword Coast Brandy, Waterdeep Sweetmeats, at the market and deliver them to the Driftwood Tavern.^Could you do me a big favor? I'm a quartermaster for the City Guard. Our barracks were damaged in the attack, so the officers are using the Driftwood Tavern as a temporary headquarters. I'm supposed to deliver provisions there for their planning meeting, but Lord Neverember just summoned me to go over some paperwork. Neverember hates to be kept waiting! Could you pick up the supplies from the market and deliver them for me? Here's a list. Just keep heading south.
The Theft of the Crown^4^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Rags to Riches^Finding Honor^Investigate the Vaults beneath the Hall of Justice.^I got a report about some disturbances in the vaults beneath the Hall of Justice. The guard are spread thin after the last attack, but you've proven yourself more than capable, so I'd like to ask you to look into it for me. I've told the gate guard you're coming. He'll let you into the vault.
Finding Honor^4^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^The Theft of the Crown^The Trail of the Crown^Interrogate the thief named Honor. She is hiding out in the ruined building across from the Driftwood Tavern in Protector's Enclave.^The Nashers have stolen the Crown of Neverwinter from the vault, but we still have a chance to recover it. We just need to catch the two thieves who escaped, and trace where the Nashers are hiding Crown. We know that one of thieves, a sly rogue called "Honor" Reigh, uses a ruined building near the Driftwood Tavern as her hideout. The Nashers will flee if they see me or my squad approach, but you might be able to corner here, and find out if Honor still has the Crown.
Evacuate Blacklake^6^Scout Stone^Blacklake District^Scout Stone^Blacklake District^^Firestarters^Rescue Neverwinter's Citizens from the Blacklake District.^Hello there. Are you the one the higher ups sent to help me clean up this mess? Well, let me fill you in: the situation in Blacklake is bad. These "Sons of Alagondar" have driven off most of the citizenry, but some refuse to leave their homes. The Nashers responded by boarding them up in therem robbing anyone in the street and setting fire to buildings. The first thing we're going to need to do is rescue any trapped citizens we can find.
Firestarters^6^Scout Stone^Blacklake District^Scout Stone^Blacklake District^Evacuate Blacklake^Dirty Deeds^Defeat 2 Nasher Hexers and put and end to their rampage.^Not content to spout their rhetoric and terrorize people in the streets, the Nashers are starting fires as well. They don't have much that will light in this slime covered mess. But their magicians, the Hexers, are able to set fires with magic. Kill them, and I think we'll have fewer property fires.
Dirty Deeds^8^Scout Stone^Blacklake District^Scout Stone^Blacklake District^Firestarters^^Track down the Nasher thief and recover the Stolen Deeds.^Now that we've done some good for the people of Blacklake, there's a small problem we need to take care of. The Nashers have stolen a set of deeds that were in the possession of Lord Neverember. They were not legally obtained, so who knows what they plan to use them for. Personally, I'd rather not find out! The thief escaped to Blacklake District. Hunt the thief down and retrieve the deeds.
Nashing of Teeth^6^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^Zoey Fargo^Blacklake District^Seeking a Suspect^Close to the Crown^Fight Nashers in the neighborhood called the Tatters, then meet with Zoey Fargo.^According to Gothwan's information, Karzov is hiding in a safe house nearby, while the Crown is hidden in their headquarters. Before we can move against either, we need to reduce the number of potential reinforcements. A trek through the Tatters should provide ample opportunity for that. When you're cleared the area, meet with Private Zoey Fargo. She's keeping watch over the safe house where Karzov is hiding.
Close to the Crown^5^Zoey Fargo^Blacklake District^Zoey Fargo^Blacklake District^Nashing of Teeth, Hot on the Trail^Lakefront Property, Cornering Karzov^Raid the Nasher Safehouse in search of Karzov.^The Nashers set fire to the safe house to cover their escape, but I didn't see Karzov leave. We might still have a chance to catch him here. Oh, and I'm coming with you. Karzov put a bounty on my head and I want to pay him back in kind!
Lakefront Property^8^Zoey Fargo^Blacklake District^^Blacklake District^Close to the Crown^^Burn Nasher Supply Crates by the lake.^You're going to need a distraction to keep the Nashers off your back while you're going after Karzov, and I think I know just the thing. The Nashers have been smuggling supplies across the lake, supplies they need for their "revolution." Set some of those supplies on fire on your way to Nasher Headquarters. That should keep them plenty busy.
Stolen Supplies^9^Hazel the Alchemist^Blacklake District^Hazel the Alchemist^Blacklake District^^Sampling Sludge^Recover Hazel's stolen Alchemical Supplies.^We alchemists are here researching the Blacklake sludge to see if it has any useful properties. Unfortunately, Nasher rebels mistook our last shipment of supplies for potions and made off with them. Maybe you could get them back for me?
Cornering Karzov^9^Zoey Fargo^Blacklake District^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Close to the Crown^Trouble in the Tower District, Nest Egg^Attack Nasher Headquarters to defeat Karzov and recover the Crown of Neverwinter.^Karzov will head for Nasher Headquarters, an old warehouse by the shore of the lake. According to Gothwan, that's where they're keeping the Crown as well. This is it! Time to put down the Nasher rebellion and recover the Crown.
Thinning the Horde^26^Doomguide Orran^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Orran^Neverdeath Graveyard^The Missing Doomguides^^Kill Zombies and Hulks in Pauper's Field^The clerics of Kelemvor are sworn to care for both the dead and the grieving. When faced with the undead, we try to use Kelemvor's power to gently return the dead to their eternal slumber. In this case, however, the dead are rising in such numbers that we are hard-pressed to hold our position here. If you enter Paupers Field, I ask with heavy heart that you destroy any undead you find so that we do not lose our foothold here.
Mercenary Nature^28^Captain Zemmer^Neverdeath Graveyard^Captain Zemmer^Neverdeath Graveyard^^Whack a Gnoll, Filial Villainy^Kill Cult of the Dragon Mercenaries^The Cult of the Dragon has been hiring mercenaries to build up their ranks. They even hired a bunch of my men right out from under my command! Of course, since those men broke their contracts, that means I could hire someone to teach them the price of disloyalty. In fact, I have a position open right now...
Red Rituals^27^Doomguide Orran^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Orran^Neverdeath Graveyard^Rest in Peace^Dragon Attack, The Emissary of the Dead, Enter the Dragons^Find out what purpose the Bone Porters serve.^The Red Wizards are using some of the newly exhumed skeletons to excavate bones and relics from Pauper's Field. The undead are then transporting these items through a southern gate to a very old portion of Neverdeath. We need to find out where these "bone porters" are going and why!
Whack a Gnoll^28^Captain Zemmer^Neverdeath Graveyard^Captain Zemmer^Neverdeath Graveyard^Mercenary Nature^^Kill Gnolls in Neverdeath.^I hate gnolls. They're vile, nasty, and regularly get hired by the Thayans for dirty work. I've lost dozens of good men to those vermin. I remember one time my company was surrounded by... Wait, why am I telling you any of this? The important thing is, I'll pay good money for dead gnolls. The reasons really don't matter.
A Doomguide's Duty^3^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Rest in Peace, A Lich's Lament, The Undead and the Dying^The Emissary of the Dead^Help Acolyte Neyman purge the undead from fields around the Tree of Souls.^For years the Tree of Souls was the site of choice for the mass burial of bandits and criminals. Many despicable men are interred beneath its roots, but so are innocent souls who were wrongly accused and unjustly executed. As a result, the area near the tree is infused with an evil spiritual energy. Valindra's Thayan wizards have found a way to tap into this energy and are using it to fuel their rituals. Acolyte Neyman believes a ritual cleansing of the area will disperse the energy, but she will need a protector during the ceremony. Go and speak to her.
A Lich's Lament^3^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^The Missing Doomguides^A Doomguide's Duty^Investigate the magical artifact in the graveyard.^We have received reports of cursed whispers and nefarious magic coming from a strange object recently unearthed in the graveyard. With all of the undead rising, I have no one able to investigate. I suspect it may be a powerful magical focus, or cursed trinket, but I trust you to handle this situation with care. Will you retrieve this artifact and return to our camp?
The Emissary of the Dead^3^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^A Doomguide's Duty^Wearers of Purple^Enter the Thayan camp and find a way to disrupt Xivros' ritual.^One of Valindra's lieutenants, Xivros, is attempting to raise a powerful ogre warlord as an undead servant. It took ten heroes to bring down Arleon the Unforgiven when he was mortal--an undead version of him would be truly formidable. Go to the Thayan camp deep in the ruins of Neverdeath and stop this ritual. If Xivros is successful, Arleon will lead an undead army against Neverwinter!
Wearers of Purple^4^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^The Emissary of the Dead^Enter the Dragons, Dragon Attack^Speak with Harper Windle in Neverdeath Graveyard.^You've done a great deal to stabilize the situation in Pauper's Field. The Doomguide's can deal with the undead that remain. There is something else I'd like your help with now. We've received reports of strange purple-clad figures operating in the portion of the graveyard known as Craftsman's Rest. That means little to me, but it seems to have drawn the attention of the Harpers. And anything that concerns the Harpers is certain to be trouble. You'll find Harper Windle not far from here. She will tell you more.
Enter the Dragons^4^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Wearers of Purple^Artifact Snatch, History Lessons^Collect Cultist Orders from Dragon Cultists.^The purple-clad intruders in Craftsman's Rest are well known to the Harpers. They are members of the Cult of the Dragon, a group dedicated to restoring control of the world to dragon overlords. Whatever brings them here, we can be certain it bodes no good for Neverwinter. The Cult of the Dragon does not usually operate so openly. Defeat them and search them for messages, orders, any document you can find. If you can collect enough, I should be able to crack their code. Oh, and if you have time, see if you can aid that scholar Chettlebell over there. He can be.. odd, but his research may come in handy.
Correcting History^26^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^^Filial Villainy^Help Tristopher's Client by altering dates on gravestones.^I have a friend who has hired, err, I mean asked me to help prove her birthright, lest scurrilous rumors keep her from marrying well. Unfortunately, it appears that some rapscallions are so determined to slander my friend that they've altered the dates of birth and death on several gravestones to discredit her claim to noble descent. You see a capable and enterprising person. Perhaps you could assist me by correcting some of those headstones?
Dragon Attack^4^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Wearers of Purple^Artifact Snatch, History Lessons^Rescue Zami Monini from the Monini Crypts.^Good day! Tristopher Chettlebell, Neverwinter's preeminent historian at your service. I am currently in the employ of Zami Monini--of the Blacklake Moninis. Miss Monini hired me to perform research into her family's history. While we were inspecting the family crypts in Craftsman's Rest, we were set upon by uncouth hooligans in purple robes. I managed to escape, but Miss Monini was less fortunate. No ransom demand has been put forth, so I fear for my employer--and my income! You must rescue her!
Artifact Snatch^4^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Enter the Dragons, Dragon Attack^Wheels Within Wheels, Opening the Way^Collect Waterclock Guild artifacts from Gnolls and wheelbarrows.^While you were hard at work in Craftsman's Rest I had the most intriguing conversation with our young "genius", Tristopher Chettlebell. I'm certain now that the Thayans are attempting to enter the old Waterclock Guild Crypts. Something tells me it would be wise to prevent that. The Red Wizards and their gnoll allies are looting the tombs of Craftsman's Rest, hoping to find the secret to unlocking the Waterclock Tomb. Capture any artifacts they have found and bring them to me. Perhaps we can solve this puzzle ourselves.
Filial Villainy^28^Captain Zemmer^Neverdeath Graveyard^Captain Zemmer^Neverdeath Graveyard^Mercenary Nature^^Gather Journals and burn the Lab of Zemmer's Necromancer father.^My father wasn't the best role model. Actually, he was a Thayan necromancer. We haven't talked since I joined the church of Tempus, but rumors about him have kept my mercenary company from getting any lucrative jobs with Lord Neverember. That squirrely little Chettlebell guy across the way says you can help out with this kind of thing. Say, by finding my father's journals and burning his old lab?
History Lessons^4^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Enter the Dragons, Dragon Attack^Wheels Within Wheels, Opening the Way^Enter the Artisan's Tomb and recover Chettlebell's Book and Loose Pages.^Miss Monini said her captors spoke of someone named "Azharzel". I seem to remember coming across that name while researching her family. I need one of my books, "The Annals of Neverdeath", to confirm my suspicions. Unfortunately I lost the book when I made my hasty departure from Craftsman's Rest. As I fled, I saw gnolls tearing open my pack and pawing through the books inside. They did alarming damage to them--pages were flung everywhere! Please search the Artisan's Tomb and recover my research materials. We need to know what these cultists are searching for.
Dirty Business^26^Cloaked Man^Neverdeath Graveyard^Gorim Tomb-robber^Neverdeath Graveyard^^First Impressions^Locate and make contact with Gorim Tomb-robber in Pauper's Field in the Graveyard.^In this graveyard are some unscrupulous individuals hunting for a family heirloom of great value. You and me are some unscrupulous individuals who are hunting those who hunt this heirloom. Sound like the kind of work you're interested in? Find Gorim Tomb-robber in Pauper's Field. Convince him you're here to help. When you find the heirloom bring it to me. Right?
First Impressions^26^Gorim Tomb-robber^Neverdeath Graveyard^Gorim Tomb-robber^Neverdeath Graveyard^Dirty Business^Rooting Out^Collect grave rubbings of Lucanis Family Graves in Pauper's Field in the Graveyard.^We've got a big score lined up, but it's going slower than we'd like. See, we knew our score was buried in a grave in the graveyard, but being from Luskan, we had no idea how damned big this graveyard is. You Neverwinter folk sure know how to die, eh? Take this paper and charcoal. Find graves of members of the Lucanis family. They're scattered all over this place. Get a rubbing of those graves and bring 'em back here, yeah? 
Spellplague Caverns^51^Quorthon^The Chasm^^^Source of Corruption^^Gather a party and enter the Spellplague Caverns to destroy the source of evil which taints the Chasm.^Your investigation of the Twisted Fane has proven two things: First, the Fane itself was nothing more than an elaborate distraction. I should have known that huge glowing crystal was too obvious for the sinister and secretive force that threatens us. Second, the true source of corruption lies even deeper in these hellish depths, in that region called the Spellplague Caverns. You have accomplished a great deal, <name>, but the evil that lurks below us is certain to prove more than any hero can overcome alone. Assemble a party of adventurers before you attempt to put an end to this madness.
Rooting Out^26^Gorim Tomb-Robber^Neverdeath Graveyard^GorimTomb-robber^Cloaked Man^First Impressions^^Secure Lucanis Heirloom in Pauper's Field in the Graveyard.^Alight, new-blood, it's time for you to prove yerself. The rubbings  you took, combined with some of our own leads, have revealed to us the grave where we'll find the heirloom. Now it's time for you to show us what yer made of. The heirloom's buried next to the headstone of Turlic Lucanis. This Turlic cove is buried beneath a tree across a chasm. I'll put it on yer map. Dig it up and bring it to me, yeah?
Opening the Way^4^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Artifact Snatch, History Lessons^The Clockwork Tomb^Go to Craftman's Rest in the Shadowfell and open the Shadow Lock.^Apparently, Miss Monini's ancestor was both a powerful member of the Waterclock Makers Guild, and a Dragon Cultist with a Ring of Dragon Control! When he died he gave orders for the dragon Azharzel to be entombed with him. You really must deal with Azharzel before Valindra or the Cultists gain control of him. Harper Windle has knowledge of the tomb's physical locks, but there is also a metaphysical one! I'm afraid you will have to travel to the Shadowfell to trip this final lock. Add this powder to the Eternal Flame in Craftsman's Rest to open a portal to the Shadowfell.
Hunting the Summoners^33^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^Shields of Vigilance^^Slay Ashmadai Summoners in the forest and crypts outside Helm's Hold.^The Ashmadai were originally a hidden cult of the Arch-devil Asmodeus, but they gained great power by summoning devils from the Nine Hells. I've discovered they are still conducting these summoning rituals in the forests and Helmite crypts east of Helm's Hold. Slay these devil-summoners and stop them from bringing further evils into our world.
Invoking the Gods^7^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Aralynn the Pious^Protector's Enclave^^^Learn about Invocation, a skill that you may use within any Rest Zone, such as an Altar or a Campfire.^You should go see Aralynn the Pious, an invoker who spends most of her time by the Shrine of the Gods, here at the Hall of Justice. She can advise you how to invoke the power of the gods.
Wheels Within Wheels^4^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Artifact Snatch, History Lessons^The Clockwork Tomb^Activate the Waterclock Guild Seals.^Chettlebell filled me in about the dragon. I'm sure you know how bad it would be if that dragon gets loose, or worse yet, falls under Valindra's control. According to Chettlebell, the way into the Waterclock Guild tomb is locked by a complex mechanism. Multiple physical seals must be activated before you can enter. Valindra's minions don't know about this, so they are just trying to enter the tomb by force. That gives you a chance to get there first, but you need to activate those seals.
The Clockwork Tomb^4^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Tristopher Chettlebell^Neverdeath Graveyard^Wheels Within Wheels, Opening the Way^Graveyard at Rest^Thwart Valindra's plans in the Clockwork Tomb.^Excellent! You should be able to enter the Clockwork Tomb via the main entrance now. You had best hurry. Harper Windle's spies report that Valindra's troops are close to breaking through into the the tomb. If Valindra gets her hands on the Cult of the Dragon artifacts buried with Romani Monini and frees Azharzel, it bodes ill for Neverwinter--and yours truly, of course.
Graveyard at Rest^5^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^The Clockwork Tomb^Five Keys to Success^Return to Sergeant Knox in Protector's Enclave and report your findings in Neverdeath Graveyard.^Valindra's undead and the Cult of the Dragon are no longer a threat here in Neverdeath, and we have you to thank. Valindra escaping with the Rite of the Dracolich, however, is certainly a setback. We're sure to see her again, though it may take her some time yet to gather the necessary components. We'll be able to keep Neverdeath under control for now. I'm sure Knox will want to hear all about today's events.
Location Scouting^6^Brandy Quickstep^Blacklake District^Brandy Quickstep^Blacklake District^The Trail of the Crown^Worth Our While^Scout Brimbleton Place, Thatcher Road, and Chadwick Stoop in the Tatters area of Blacklake District.^You must be the help Tarley promised me! My job out here is to find us some property suitable for halfling habitation. I know things have taken a turn for the worse here in Blacklake, but we halflings are hardy. All we need is the land to build on and we could make some fine changes around here. I've heard that there are three promising houses on sale in the Blacklake District, though it's a bit dangerous at the moment to inspect them. Would you mind finding Brimbleton Place, Thatcher Road and Chadwick Stoop and reporting back on their state of repair?
Nature's Bounty^42^Herb Poultice^Pirates' Skyhold^Irrae^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Gather 5 Medicinal Herbs snd then return them to Irrae near Mire's Edge or to Scout Tragold in Vile bog.^You found this poultrice on one of the lizardfolk. The Herbs in it seem to be fairly easily identifiable. If you brought this poultrice and a few samples of the herbs themselves back to the Company Yargo crew, they might be appreciative for the information.
Something to Build On^43^Bag of Materials^Pirates' Skyhold^Ranger Thoros or Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Gather 5 Building Materials and bring them to Ranger Tharos near the Sinking Town or to Shaben Shortcloak near Skull Fortress.^You found a backpack of what appears to be building materials in the area around Skull Fortress. The Company Yargo forward scouts could probably use some materials like this to construct shelter and fortifications. They'd probably even reward you for bringing them some.
The Key to the Sky^45^Kayliss' Artifact^Pirates' Skyhold^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Show Captain Kayliss' Artifact to Shil Yargo.^After defeating Captain Kayliss, you found what appears to be a magical rod-like artifact. Perhaps Shil Yargo will know what its purpose is.
Predator and Prey^43^Eye of the Predator^Pirates' Skyhold^Lili Huntinghawk^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Show The Eye of the Predator to Lili Huntinghawk.^One of the Predator's eyes survived the battle instact. It looks almost like a blood-red duby. Perhaps a Company Yargo crewmember will be interested in purchasing it from you.
The Crypt of Vigilance^33^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^^^Enter the Crypt of Vigilance and slay Halas the Pure.^After you defeated the Shepherd of the Damned, the Ashmadai turned to other schemes. Their attempts to summon more devils and corrupt the Shields of Helm were all intended to help them desecrate the Crypt of Vigilance, an ancient tomb for heroes who perished in Helm's service. The cult leader is an evil cleric called "Halas the Pure". Slay him, and secure the safe rest of the honored dead.
The Sanatorium^34^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^Alisara Callum^Helm's Hold^^^Enter the Sanatorium and slay Rohini, the succubus "Prophet" of the Ashmadai.^The time has come to attack Rohini in her place of power. I am preparing what forces we have, but I fear that if what the otherworldly being Hexabaal told you is correct, it could be a trap. I've decided to send you on a secret mission. I want you to search for the hidden entrance to the Sanatorium beneath Helm's Hold, make your way up into the Cathedral, and strike at Rohini from there. Hopefully, when we next meet, it will be to celebrate banishing Rohini back to the Nine Hells.
A Shadow in Rothé Valley^52^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Dassar Truebow^Rothé Valley^^Scouting for Rangers, Raiders of Rothé Valley^Travel to Rothé Valley to meet with the ranger Dassar Truebow and battle the drow slaving expedition.^You've faced many dangerous foes on Neverwinter's behalf, but this could be the most dire threat yet. A group of rangers reports that the farming village of Rothé Valley has been attacked by a massive drow slaving expedition. Should they gain a foothold on the surface world, all of the Sword Coast could be in peril. The Rangers are led by an elf named Dassar Truebow. You may remember him from Helm's Hold. He'll be able to tell you more about the situation once you arrive.
Nest Egg^10^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^^^Retrieve Grace Rathburn's jewelry.^I've gotten disturbing reports from the Seven Suns Coster Market. There are kobolds loose in the city! We can't let them get a foothold in the Enclave or we'll never be rid of them. The kobolds robbed Grace Rathburn's market stall in broad daylight! The thieves made their escape through a small sewer grate. I'd like you to track the kobolds down and retrieve Grace's stolen jewelry.
The Lurking in Blacklake^8^Penny the Apprentice^Blacklake District^Penny the Apprentice^Blacklake District^^^Complete the Blacklake Terror! skirmish.^You have to hurry! Undead are boiling out of the lake and overrunning the waterfront! My sister Piniwin and our employer Hazel the Alchemist are trying to stop them, but if they don't get help soon they'll be killed!.
Sampling Sludge^8^Hazel the Alchemist^Blacklake District^Hazel the Alchemist^Blacklake District^Stolen Supplies^^Collect new Sludge Samples for Hazel.^We alchemists are here researching the Blacklake sludge to see if it has any useful properties. Unfortunately, Nasher rebels mistook our last shipment of supplies for potions and made off with them. Maybe you could get them back for us?
Domination^10^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Domination Battlemaster^Protector's Enclave^^^Visit the Domination Battlemaster in Protector's Enclave to explore PvP combat.^The Domination Battlemaster controls access to the Player versus Player Arena of Neverwinter. PvP allows you to queue up with friends to fight other players and prove who is the strongest. Visit the Domination Battlemaster in Protector's Enclave to test your mettle in the bloodiest arena in all of the Forgotten Realms!
Finder's Fee^10^Rus Ottley^Sewers^Ottley's Associate^Protector's Enclave^Nest Egg^^Recover 12 scrolls from the sewer.^Hello friend! <Cough> Afraid you haven't caught me at my best. Stabbed, you see. Kobolds are nasty little buggers. I represent one of Neverwinter's leading citizens. He discovered his place of business was burglarized during the night. The thieves made off with a little money and a lot of important business records. I was offered a fee to recover the stolen scrolls. Since I'm not fond of human waste, nor of being stabbed, I am now offering "you" a portion of this fee. Once you've found the scrolls, take them to my associate. He's waiting for me just outside the sewer entrance.
False Idols^5^Treasure at end of Nest Egg^Protector's Enclave^Wylandar Ilmarin^Protector's Enclave^^^Take the Broken Idol to Rhix.^You found a small carved idol in the chest beneath a false bottom. The piece has seen better days; it is chipped and worn and the gems have been pried from their settings. However it may still be worth something. You recall seeing an odd kobold named Rhix outside the Seven Suns market. He was offering Astral Diamonds to passersby in exchange for artifacts like this. Perhaps he can tell you what it is worth.
Trouble in the Tower District^10^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Cornering Karzov^Saving the Guards, Ending the Torture^Meet with Sergeant Creed at the Fallen Tower Tavern in the Tower District.^There's trouble brewing in the Blacklake, I think you might be just what we need. Go to the Tower District and meet with Sergeant Creed at the Fallen Tower Tavern, he can tell you more.
Topping Off^10^Barmaid^Tower District^Barmaid^Tower District^^^Take the Beer Mugs from the bar and deliver them to 5 thirsty patrons.^Hey, got a minute? I've got orders to fill and my server's disappeared on me. The tavern's packed today and I don't have time to be running around bringing people drinks. If you can deliver these beers for me, I'll make it worth your while.
Going Once, Going Twice...^14^"New Unlocks Window^Level 14^^Protector's Enclave^^^Visit an Auctioneer in Protector's Enclave to learn about the auction house.^The Tarmalune Auction House is the best way to turn your dungeon-delving exploits into hard-currency or to find that weapon or relic you always wanted! Visit an auctioneer to manage your sales, or to view what others have posted.
A Companion^16^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^^Grand Emporium, Protector's Enclave^^Care and Feeding^Visit Bael An Ashock to learn about companions, and collect your first as a reward.^I'm very impressed with the work you've been doing on behalf of the city, but the road ahead will be tough to travel solo. There is a man, Bael An Ashock, who runs a business here in the Enclave supplying adventurers with companions. He can explain it all to you in more detail if you're interested. Visit with Bael at the Grand Emporium and learn about companions. I've arranged to have him supply you with one free of charge, as a reward for your hard work.
Acolytes of Corruption^51^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quorthon^The Chasm^Foulspawn Foothold^Cathedral of Madness^Slay Acolytes of Corruption and search their bodies for an Order of Blue Fire Talisman.^The Order of Blue Fire, under their false prophetess Senobith the Corruptor is spreading a message of acceptance and submission in the face of the Spellplague. Senobith must be dealt with, but she stays hidden within the ruins of the old Cathedral of Mystra which is sealed by powerful magical wards. Blue Flame Acolytes can pass these wards with the aid of a magical talisman. Slay the Acolytes of Corruption and search them for an Order of Blue Flame Talisman.
Warning Your Enemies^6^Investigator Rannigan^Blacklake District^Investigator Rannigan^Blacklake District^An Active Investigation^^Place 5 Warning Posters around the Blacklake District to alert the Nashers to the Ashmadai threat.^Just as I suspected. This isn't good news. It's not often as an Investigator that you hope your information is wrong. We need to warn the Nashers. As much of a problem as they are, they're less dangerous as rebels than they are as devil-worshiping cultists... Alright, I have another task for you. I've crafted some warning notices about the infiltrating Ashmadai and how to identify them, and I want you to place them on buildings in this area of Blacklake. The Nashers won't speak to us directly, but maybe a few of them will see the warnings and take them seriously.
Into the Tower^10^Assistant Lugan^Tower District^Assistant Lugan^Tower District^^A Cantrip Trip^Speak to the Ghostly Archmage within the Fallen Tower.^You might not know me, but I sent a letter by way of introduction. In any case, I'm glad you're here. You see I am looking for an arcane caster to collaborate with on a resesarch project. Specifically, the alterations in magic caused by the Spellplague. This district once housed Neverwinter's guild of magicians. I'm not quite sure where to start, however. As you can see there is something of an orc problem. The top of the fallen tower appears to have a great deal of risidual energy pouring out of it. But the damn orcs have blocked the path up there.
A Cantrip Trip^10^Assistant Lugan^Tower District^^Tower District^Into the Tower^The Book Club^Find areas of Magical Instability and observe the effects of cantrips within them.^Ricven mentioned parts of the old weave which allowed this old spell to work did he? Hmm, I happen to be in possession of an old map of arcane power concentrations in the area. My theory is that the most concentrated spots would remain stable enough to allow you to cast ghost sound. Here, I'll mark the locations on your map. While you are rummaging about out there, keep your eye out for any old tomes. Who knows what other spells we might find!
The Book Club^11^Finding discarded spellbook^Tower District^Assistant Lugan^Tower District^A Cantrip Trip^^Recover Old Spellbooks from nearby Many-Arrows.^This is an arcane spellbook, but the spells it contains are older than the spellplague, and must now be rendered useless. Though the book is hundreds of years old, it appears to be well preserved. This must have only recently been removed from some library or other, and then discarded. Perhaps orcs carried these books out of the Cloak Tower. Defeat some Many-Arrows orcs to find more spellbooks.
Saving the Guards^10^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Trouble in the Tower District^Lost Dispatch^Rescue 5 Captured Guards around Waukeen Way, the rise south of Fallen Tower Tavern.^Some of our Neverwinter Guard patrols have gone missing while exploring Waukeen Way. We suspect they have been captured or killed by the Many-Arrows orcs. If there are any soldiers left alive, they must be rescued before the orc torturers get a hold of them!
Ending the Torture^10^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Trouble in the Tower District^Lost Dispatch^Kill 25 Orcs around Waukeen Way, the rise south of Fallen Tower Tavern.^The Many-Arrows orcs are known for their savagery and sadistic cruelty. We've had reports of orcs torturing our soldiers around Waukeen Way, on the rise south of the Fallen Tower Tavern. Thin out their numbers and return here. We must send a clear message to the orcs!
Lost Dispatch^10^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Saving the Guards, Ending the Torture^Sewer Crawl^Recover the Lost Dispatch from a courier bag around Pedlars Path, the area between Fallen Tower Tavern and Merchant Square, and take it to Captain Janros at the Neverwinter Guard Post.^Before we secured the road between the Fallen Tower Tavern and the Neverwinter Guard Post the journey was treacherous. We tried sending dispatches through Pedlars Path by courier but they never arrived. We fear the couriers are dead but the information they carried is still valuable. Recover a lost dispatch from a courier bag around Pedlars Path and bring it to Captain Janros at the Neverwinter Guard post.
Sewer Crawl^12^Captain Janros^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Lost Dispatch^Bringing to Task, Supply Recovery^Search the Merchant Square Sewers east of the Neverwinter Guard Post and defeat the Nasher rebel leader Karr Nevrim.^According to the dispatch you recovered from the dead courier, the orcs are not the only problems we have around here. There are reports of a holdout Nasher rebel cell led by a half-orc called Karr Nevrim operating in the sewers underneath Merchant Square. Nevrim's suspected of shady dealings with the Many-Arrows Tribe, undermining the safety of the city. We need you to head into the Merchant Square Sewers and defeat this upstart before he becomes another Karzov!
Orc Bounty^10^Bounty Master^Tower District^Bounty Master^Tower District^^^Collect 5 Many-Arrows Insignias from Orcs in the Tower District.^The Tower District may not be in a good state, but the presence of the orcs make it worse. I'm looking for adventurers willing to help cull their numbers. Slay orcs throughout the Tower District. Collect Many-Arrows Orc Insignias and return them to me. I will grant you something to aid you in your struggles against them!
Fire Bugs^11^Gerad Kinesward^Tower District^Riftel Farsight^Tower District^^^Collect 6 Elemental Weevils from the Merchant Square in the Tower District.^My mistress sent me out here to gather up her lost specimens, but I've just discovered I have a terrible fear of getting killed by orcs! I think I'm safe here, but I dare not go out there. I don't suppose you'd gather the specimens for me and take them to Riftel Farsight? She found these fiery bugs on the slopes of Mount Hotenow. She calls them her 'elemental weevils.' I'm sure she'll reward you for returning them. Careful picking them up, though. They are hot.
Bringing to Task^12^Captain Janros^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Sewer Crawl^Returning the Pain^Kill 5 Orc Taskmasters around Merchant Square, the area south of Neverwinter Guard Post.^The Many-Arrows orcs have vicious warband leaders who whip them up into a frenzy to attack our people. If we take out these Orc Taskmasters, we can decrease the orc attacks in the area.
Supply Recovery^12^Captain Janros^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Sewer Crawl^Returning the Pain^Recover 10 Supply Crates from Merchant Square, south of the Neverwinter Guard Post.^The Many-Arrows orcs have been aggressively encroaching on the area. They've gone so far as to plunder crates from some of our supply lines. If the Neverwinter Guard is to protect the city, we need to get those supplies back!
Returning the Pain^14^Captain Janros^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Bringing to Task, Supply Recovery^Spying the Cloak Tower^Enter the Merchant Guild Hall and defeat Kartok Paingiver.^Kartok Paingiver is one of the orc warband leaders responsible for the takeover of Merchant Square. His soldiers have taken over the old Merchant Guild Hall. We need you to go in and take him out!
Choosing Ground^12^Cerion Haldoreth^Tower District^Cerion Haldoreth^Tower District^^Sapping the Will^Place and Defend 3 Beacons in the Tower District.^Long ago, the kingdom of Illefarn stretched out for hundreds of miles, encompassing even the city of Neverwinter. Humans settling here was... acceptable. But orcs invading this deep into our ancient land? A travesty. I have spoken to the captain and offered aid. Elven archers are prepared to assist in the defense of the Tower District, but we must choose our positions carefully. Take these beacons and place them at the points I've marked on your map. An archer will arrive at each beacon, though you'll have to protect the beacon from orcs until they arrive. Are you prepared for the task?
Sapping the Will^12^Cerion Haldoreth^Tower District^Cerion Haldoreth^Tower District^Choosing Ground^^Kill 3 Orc Sappers near the Merchant Guild Hall in the Tower District.^Something we never really attended in ancient time: There are always more orcs. Kill one, three take their place. But they must come from somewhere. Somewhere near the Guild Hall, there must be tunnels. I suspect there are several sappers amongst the orcs, responsible for maintaining these tunnels. An orc sapper is a necessarily rare thing. Orcs have little patience with study, and engineering is a complex field. If you don't tend a tree's roots, it will die. A city is much the same. Kill the sappers before this city dies.
Hunting the Relics^13^Kynorath Greybeard^Tower District^Kynorath Greybeard^Tower District^^^Participant in the Relic Hunt Contest. Search for Lost Relics around the Tower District, then claim your reward from Kynorath Greybeard at the Neverwinter Guard Post.^The Tower District was once the center of commerce for Neverwinter. The merchants who lived here worshipped Waukeen, the goddess of wealth. Many merchants had private shrines to Waukeen with a golden cornucopia at the center to bless them with riches. When the cataclysm struck Neverwinter, many of these relics were lost. They are an important part of the history of the city, and should be recovered. Help us reclaim these lost relics by participating in the Relic Hunt Event!
Spying the Cloak Tower^14^Captain Janros^Tower District^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Returning the Pain^Conquest for Gruumsh, The Eyes Have It^Follow the path east of the Neverwinter Guard Post to meet with Private Quickfoot, the through the wall breach south of there to meet with Scout Gaelen.^You've proven invaluable in our struggle against the orcish threat. Now it's time to take the fight to the heart of the enemy! Our scouts found a path to the Cloak Tower through a wall breach to the southeast. Follow the path east and meet with Private Quickfoot, then through the breach to meet with Scout Gaelen. They'll brief you on the next tasks.
Strange Alchemy^47^Garora Oakhew ^Icespire Peak^Garora Oakhew ^Icespire Peak^The Forward Front^Under Thin Ice, Thinning the Pack^Retrieve 5 vials of Ice Troll Blood from Ice Trolls in Icespire Peak.^These Ice Trolls heal so fast that our troops are having serious problems getting them to stay down. I've asked our alchemist, Nalias Greyguard, to try to concoct something we can distribute to all the soldiers that will help with that problem, but he needs blood from the ice trolls to experiment on. It'd be a big help if you could collect some for us.
Troubled Times^17^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^^The Wizard's Folly^Sgt. Knox has asked you to go to Josef Linkletter's House and help his Spellscarred wife Dorothea, even if it means breaking the Protector's Law for the Spellscarred.^<name>, you've more than proven yourself to me, so I feel I can trust you with a… delicate matter. One of my men, Josef Linkletter, has been absent the last few days. I fear it's his wife, Dorothea. She's Spellscarred, touched by the Spellplague, and I'm afraid she's getting worse. I want you to look in on them at their house near the Driftwood Tavern. Do whatever you can to help them. I can't ignore the Protector's Law, but you are free to do what's right.
The Wizard's Folly^17^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Troubled Times^Spellburst^Find Tualo the Bright and learn more about Rhazzad.^I want to know more about that "Rhazzad" character who helped Dorothea Linkletter. I've heard a rumor that someone matching his description was seen talking to Tualo the Bright, one of the city's preeminent wizards. Go to Tualo's home and talk to him there. He may be able to tell us more about Rhazzad.
Spellburst^18^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^The Wizard's Folly^The Plague Tower^Find Josef Linkletter in the Beggar's Nest neighborhood of Protector's Enclave.^What we've found out about Rhazzad may just be a coincidence, but my gut says otherwise. Linkletter needs to know. He's out in a part of the city called the Beggar's Nest hunting down another Dead Rats warren. Find him and tell him what you've learned. By Ilmater's tears, I hope I'm wrong. Those two have suffered enough.
Giddy Up^10^^Level 10^^Protector's Enclave^^^Visit the Mount Merchant in Protector's Enclave to receive your first mount.^A hero of your mettle needs an equally fine mount. Head down to the Shaundakar Stables and talk with the mount merchants there. You'll cut a fine figure riding around on a swift horse, or maybe one of their more exotic mounts is your style. See what they have to offer.
The Broker^12^Sergeant Knox^Level 12^Auction Broker^Protector's Enclave^^^Visit the Auction Broker in Protector's Enclave to see what he's found for you on the auction house.^There's an auction broker down in the Seven Suns Coster Market who will search through all available auctions to locate the items that are right for you. It might be worthwhile to head down to the Market and see what he recommends.
The Plague Tower^19^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Spellburst^^Travel to the Plague Tower and kill Rhazzad.^The wizard Rhazzad preyed on those stricken by the spellplague, promising them treatment in his "Tower of Solace". Instead he used them to power some dark ritual, causing a spellburst that devastated part of the city. But I fear that was just a side effect. Rhazzad is even now working to complete his ritual. He has to be stopped. For the sake of the city, and to avenge those he betrayed and killed!
Trouble at the Broken Crown^21^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Seven Toes^Blackdagger Ruins^Trouble in the Ranks^Hunting for a Harper^Meet with Seven Toes at the Broken Crown Inn near the ruins of Blackdagger Keep.^Some time back, the Luskan pirate Traven Blackdagger built a fortress north of Neverwinter and made it the heart of his own bandit kingdom. His Blackdagger Bandits are disrupting Neverwinter's vital trade routes. A secretive group known as the Harpers has offered to help Neverwinter put an end to Traven Blackdagger's schemes. I don't know much about the Harpers, but I'm not going to turn down any offer of help. I'd like to you to work with them. The Harpers already have agents in place. Look for a man called Seven Toes, near the Broken Crown Tavern, south of Blackdagger Ruins.
Hunting for a Harper^21^Seven Toes^Blackdagger Ruins^Old Lenn^Blackdagger Ruins^Trouble at the Broken Crown^Lights on the Rocks^Examine the dead bodies along the High Road to see if the Blackdagger Bandits have killed Xalliana, and then talk to Old Len the lighthouse keeper and ask if he saw her.^My partner, a tiefling wizardess named Xalliana, was supposed to meet us here at the Broken Crown, but she never made it. I fear that the Blackdagger Bandits might have caught her in an ambush along the High Road and killed her. I'm not tough enough to search for her, but I can give you a description so you can look for the body. If you don't find her corpse, then maybe something happened to her ship. Talk to Old Lenn, the lighthouse keeper. if her ship was wrecked, he'd have seen it happen.
Lights on the Rocks^21^Old Lenn^Blackdagger Ruins^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Hunting for a Harper^Salvaging Order, Savaging Salvagers^Light the 3 Shore Beacons, and then meet the Harper agent Xalliana.^Them Blackdagger Bandits took over the shore beacons, and now they use 'em to lure ships onto the rocks. I figure that Xalliana person you're lookin' for was on the ship that wrecked the other night. If she's still alive, she's probably hiding nearby, waitin' for a signal to show herself. Back in the old days, Harpers used to slip me the odd gold to light the beacons as signals. Might still work -- light 'em up, and if Xalliana is there, she'll see 'em. You doin' that would also save me the trouble of crackin' all them bandits' heads. There's a lot of 'em, and my lumbago might flare up a'fore I was done.
Salvaging Order^22^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Lights on the Rocks^The Sea Caves^Recover Xalliana's Sealed Orders, Supplies, and Equipment.^The bandits lured our ship onto the rocks, and my sealed orders and all of my gear washed ashore for them to salvage. If I'm to carry out my investigation and help you with yours, I'll first need your aid to recover my equipment.
Savaging Salvagers^22^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Lights on the Rocks^The Sea Caves^Kill 5 Bandit Salvagers.^The Blackdagger Bandits' Salvagers pick through the wreckage of the ships they lure onto the rocks, taking anything of worth and selling shipwrecked survivors into slavery. Killing these heartless men will hurt the bandits, and give some justice to their victims.
A Leaky Proposition^22^Old Lenn^Blackdagger Ruins^Old Lenn^Blackdagger Ruins^^The Hidden Cove^Go to Raven Cliff Beach and knock holes in Bandit Rowboats.^You know what would slow them scurvy Blackdaggers down some? I'll tell ya! The bandits use their rowboats to capture ships what get run aground off shore. If you was to knock some holes in them rowboats, that would cause a bit of chaos, eh?
Conquest for Gruumsh^15^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Spying the Cloak Tower^Fists of the Warband^Gather 3 Battle Plans from around the main Many-Arrows Camp north of the Cloak Tower.^The Many-Arrows Orcs are aggressively taking over this area of the city. In order to combat this threat we need to find out more of what they're planning. Head over to the main Many-Arrows Camp south of the Cloak Tower and gather whatever battle plans you can find. Once you've found enough battle plans, it should give you a good idea about who to target next.
The Eyes Have It^15^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Spying the Cloak Tower^Fists of the Warband^Kill 5 Eye of Gruumsh Warders around the Many-Arrows Camp north of the Cloak Tower.^The Eye of Gruumsh Warders are powerful shamans who maintain a mystical ward sealing the Cloak Tower. If we defeat a number of them, it should weaken the ward enough for you to get through. From what I've seen, the Warders usually congregate around their flaming shrines to Gruumsh.
Fists of the Warband^16^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Conquest for Gruumsh, The Eyes Have It^Trouble in the Ranks, The Cloak Tower^Enter the Orc Barracks in the Many-Arrows Camp and defeat Lurg Bloodspear, Drogthu Elfeater, and Kragmar Deepscar.^The battle plans you found around the Many-Arrows Camp indicate many of the attacks are being coordinated by three warband leaders. You need to enter the Orc Barracks and eliminate Lurg Bloodspear, Drogthu Elfeater, and Kragmar Deepscar. The Orc Barracks are on the far side of the Many-Arrows Camp. Luckily, I scouted out an old secret passage nearby which you can take if you don't want to fight through the orcs to get to their stronghold.
Trouble in the Ranks^17^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Fists of the Warband^Troubled Times^Talk to Sergeant Knox at the Hall of Justice in Protector's Enclave.^We've received word from Protector's Enclave. Sergeant Knox has once again requested your aid. Return to Protector's Enclave and talk to Knox at the Hall of Justice.
Reports from the Field^9^Scout Gaelen^Tower District^Well-Informed Harper^Tower District^^^Go talk to the Well-Informed Harper in the Tower District.^The immediate problems in town are starting to be under control. However, we are constantly hearing rumors of all sorts coming in from the field. Adventurers, like yourself, are seemingly never short of tales. Naturally, the inns and taverns seem to be the best place to hear these tales. However, a cheerful campfire also sees tales told. Go talk to the Well-Informed Harper who shares this outpost with me. Go and learn what rumors he has to share.
Trolls and Bridges^54^The Path of Silvanus^Rothé Valley^Halford the Druid^Rothé Valley^^^Return the slimy copy of The Path of Silvanus to Halford the Druid in Rothé Valley.^Within a troll's stomach you have found a slightly digested tome entitled, "The Path of Silvanus". Inside is written: "Return to Halford the Druid for a reward".
The Hidden Cove^23^Old Lenn^Blackdagger Ruins^Old Lenn^Blackdagger Ruins^A Leaky Proposition^^Enter the Hidden Cove and Recover Old Lenn's Sea Chest^Those nine-hells-be-damned pirates took my sea chest when I was away having a drink at the Broken Crown! It would make an old sea dog happy if you were to fetch it back for me - and knock a few of them bandits on the head while you do it? In trade, I'll let you in as to where they have a secret code. That's where they offload their booty before taking it to Jareth Grimm. The Treasure's yours, I just want my sea chest back.
The Sea Caves^22^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Salvaging Order, Savaging Salvagers^Seeking Goldseeker^Defeat Marion Hexbane and search the sea caves for clues, such as a journal or a map.^We're in luck. One of the Blackdagger Bandit leaders, the wizardess Marion Hexbane, controls their shipwrecking and salvaging from a nearby cave. Killing her will stop that operation and give us a chance to look for more clues about where to find the other leaders. This could be the first step to finding Traven Blackdagger himself.
Seeking Goldseeker^22^Xalliana^Blackdagger Ruins^Melkhor Goldseeker^Blackdagger Ruins^The Sea Caves^The Lost Caravan^Confront Melkhor Goldseeker at the Broken Crown Inn.^Hexbane's journals mention that getting leverage over a dwarven merchant named Melkhor Goldseeker was important to the plans of Krag Foultooth, the leader of the Blackdagger Bandits' gnolls. I'd like you to confront Goldseeker at the Broken Crown Inn and find out why the Bandits are interested in him.
Hungry Like the Wolves^5^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Forsworn Wolf Trainer^Vellosk^Company of Wolves^Sacred Meeting^Help the Wolf Trainer in the Forsworn Camp.^My people have fallen on hard times from the strife in this land. Some are too proud to ask for aid, but I trust you can ease our suffering. Speak with our tribe's wolf trainer and see what you can do for her
Good Eats^38^Jingo Rummage^Vellosk^Jingo Rummage^Vellosk^^^Gather Spiceroot, Spotted Mushroom and Umber Leaf. Add the gathered ingredients to the Hunter's Cooking Pot to lure the Ogres.^Poor Jodri! He and I were just searching the forest for herbs when these beastly wolves came upon us! I ran, but Jodri was too slow. The wolves are him while these wolf-men laughed! It was horrible! I'm not one for revenge, but I bet Jodri would have loved to teach those dogs a lesson. Gather spice root, spotted mushroom, and umber leaf from the area sound of here and place them in one the hunter's cookpots. The amazing aroma should lure the ogres out of their cave and smash anyone in their path!
Ancient Heritage^5^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Company of Wolves^Sacred Meeting^Collect Ancestor Necklaces from the corpses of Ragnar, Belrak, and Davian at the Stones of Sacrifice on the west end of Hunter's Path. Return them to the Cairn of the Honored Dead.^When the Gray Wolf Tribe catch our Forsworn brethren, no mercy is shown. Their victims are bound to sacrificial stones, then tortured to death. The screams of the dying serve as a warning to others who would oppose the Netherese. One of our hunting parties was recently killed in this manner. They must not be forgotten. At the Stones of Sacrifice west of the Forsworn Camp you will find the corpses of our fallen people. Retrieve the Ancestor Necklaces from the corpses of the brothers Ragnar, Belrak, and Davian. Return them to the Cairn of the Honored dead on the south side of the Forsworn Camp.
Grave News^2^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Training Day^The Missing Doomguides^Travel to the Neverdeath Graveyard and speak to Doomguide Volahk.^The attack on the city wasn't the last we'll see of Valindra, I'm sure of it. I believe she is now working towards some wicked end in Neverdeath Graveyard. A troop of my guards just returned from there with reports of Red Wizards and necromantic rituals. I need you to venture into the graveyard and speak with Doomguide Volahk. Put a stop to whatever Valindra is plotting.
Hunting the Hunters^23^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^^^Hunt down and slay Bandit Huntsman in the mines area, and across all of Blackdagger Ruins.^I could really use the help of a <class> of your stature. We are holding our own here in the camp, but any time we venture out bandit huntsman start tracking and shooting us . It would be a great help if you could go and clear them out. Let them know who's in control of the highroad!
The Lost Caravan^23^Melkhor Goldseeker^Blackdagger Ruins^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^Seeking Goldseeker^The Hidden Mine, Tracking Through Blood^Identify the looted Caravan Wagons by their Log Books and investigate the Mine Base Camp.^The Blackdagger Bandits found out that I'd started some mines in the hills, and that I'd found some ancient ruins in one of 'em. I tried to strike a deal with them, but they wanted everything. Now I'm seeing my looted wagons on the roads, and I haven't heard from my niece back at base camp. Please, could you check the log books on the wagons to see if they were from my caravan, and then go to the base camp to find out what happened to my niece?
Tracking Through Blood^23^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^The Lost Caravan^^Kill bandit gnoll Bloodtrackers.^The Blackdagger Bandits hit our caravan before we could get to the mines. We holed up here, but every runner we sent to tell Mister Goldseeker what happened has been caught by the Bandits' gnoll Bloodtrackers. If you can kill some of those Bloodtrackers, we can make contact and get some supplies.
The Hidden Mine^23^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^^Blackdagger Ruins^The Lost Caravan^The Harper's Watch^Enter Angelhead Mine, kill the gnoll bandit leader Krag Foultooth and rescue Mira Thamros, mine forewoman and Melkhor Goldseeker's niece.^Krag Foultooth is the crazy gnoll bandit who took over the mines. And he's got Mister Goldseeker's niece, Mira Thamros, as his hostage. I'm thinking someone with your skills could get in there, kill Krag Foultooth, and rescue Mira. Are you up for it?
Nowhere to Hide^59^Cloaked Man^Protector's Enclave^Cloaked Man^Protector's Enclave^^^Uncover the conspiracy against Neverember in the Conspirator Hideout in the Protector's Enclave.^<name>, I'm glad you're here. I've received some disturbing intelligence. There is a plot to assassinate Lord Neverember fomenting right here, in Neverwinter. It's not the Nashers, it's another group. Better hidden, and with surprising resources. I've located the hideout of these conspirators. We can't afford to draw attention to these would-be-assassins. It would make the Lord Protector look vulnerable, and that's not good for anyone. So I'm sending you. The location of the hideout is on your map. You'll want to slip in through a window, as the doors are naturally guarded. Put a stop to these knaves. You're Neverwinter's only hope.
The Throne of Idris^10^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^^Ebon Downs^The Soul Slavers, The Drowned King^Back Up From Ebon Downs^Enter The Throne of Idris From the Royal Rise, destroy the Direhelm Forge, and defeat Idris.^The time has come. Idris must be defeated or all the Sword Coast could face the same fate as Ebon Downs. Fight your way into her crypt fortress, destroy the Direhelm Forge, and slay Idris herself. May Kelemvor guide your hand.
The Harper's Watch^24^Sergeant Yates^Blackdagger Ruins^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^The Hidden Mine^Bloodying the Bandits, Grimstorm Keep^Meet with Garl Gnarlclaw, Xalliana's spy among the Blackdagger Bandits.^I nearly forgot! A woman named Xalliana came looking for you while you were in the mine. She said she'd just discovered something important and couldn't wait. She told me to tell you that there's a Harper spy named Garl Gnarlclaw who will help you finish off the Blackdagger Bandits.
Words of Stone^13^Orreft Mountwatch^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^An Axe Too Far^The Final Climb^Find Icehammer Scout Messages in Icespire Peak.^Florin ordered me to bring our best scouts and spies with us here to this forward camp. Even now, they're watching the giants' every move from deep behind enemy lines. The problem is getting that information back from them so we can make decisions. Before I sent them out, I instructed them to leave messages carved into the stone of the mountain for us to find, and I'm expecting some of their reports very soon. Trek a ways up the mountain and bring back the communications they've left for us.
Clear the Path^48^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^Words of Stone^^Slay 15 enemy troops of any kind on your way to the top of Icespire Peak, then report to Erren Rockstrider.^With all the victories you've helped us win, we're going to be moving against the frost giants in force soon. Take out some more of the frost giant army on your way up the top of the mountain. It'll be a big help when the time comes for our army to strike.
The Final Climb^13^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^Meltdown, Hrimnir's Hands, Words of Stone^The Icy Guardian^Receive orders from Orreft Mountwatch, then use the Icehammer Secret Tunnel to climb to the top of Icespire Peak.^By destroying those spires and slaying the Hands, you've dealt the giants a mighty blow. But we may have an opportunity now to deal even more damage, if the information you collected from our scouts is correct. Talk to Orreft Mountwatch, my spy master here. He will explain to you what it is that we would ask you to do.
A Dangerous Distraction^48^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^The Final Climb^The Icy Guardian^Slay 6 Ice Trolls or Winter Wolves in Lakkar's Lap at the top of Icespire Peak.^You've noticed the winter wolves in Hrimnir army, yeah? Well, Rurik and I found out where they're coming from. Not only that, but we found the big one, their patriarch. Naturally, we're going to have to put the big dog down. If we strike too soon though, it's a one way trip. I need you to kill a bunch of these wolves and trolls on this ice shelf. Less to fight on the way out, you know.
Catching Light^42^Irrae^Pirates' Skyhold^Irrae^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Participate in the Catching Light contest event by collecting Flitting Wisps in Prirates' Skyhold.^When you travel out into the swamp, you may spot some wisps of light flitting here and there. At first I thought they were fey creatures or spirits, but they aren't. I'm not sure what they are. I've asked our scouts to bring a few specimens back to me for study, since they might be related to whatever is fouling the swamp. If you would like to lend a hand as well, I would be grateful.
Grimstorm Keep^25^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^The Harper's Watch^Blackdagger Bested, Blackdagger's End^Enter Grimstorm Keep and kill Jareth Grim.^Your efforts have caused Jareth Grim, the battle-leader of the Blackdagger Bandits to reveal himself. He's set up headquarters in the tower called Grimstorm Keep deep within the ruins, where he's even now planning how best to stop you. Turn the tables and kill him, and the Blackdagger Bandits will be scattered and broken.
Bloodying the Bandits^24^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^The Harper's Watch^^Kill Bandits and Bandit Officers^The Blackdagger Bandits are still a threat, and many of them have not yet been brought to justice. The harpers will pay you well if you continue bringing justice to them.
Blackdagger Bested^25^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Grimstorm Keep^^Return to Protector's Enclave and report to Sergeant Knox.^Jareth Grim has been thwarted, and with his death, the Blackdagger Bandits are no longer a significant threat. On behalf of the Harpers and all good peoples of the Sword Coast, I'd like to thank you for what you've done. Please, tell Sergeant Knox all that's happened. Perhaps this is the first step in bridging the gap between us and Neverwinter.
The Missing Doomguides^2^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Grave News^Rest in Peace, A Lich's Lament, The Undead and the Dying^Speak to Acolyte Mina Neyman. Find the missing Doomguides.^The number of undead in the Graveyard is growing at an alarming rate. If something is not done, I fear they may overrun the rest of Neverwinter.<br>I sent a detachment of Doomguides to deal with the undead in Pauper's Field. Their leader, Doomguide Severin, sent an acolyte back to tell me they were descending into the area known as the Rift, but since then we have heard nothing.<br>I would like you to find those missing Doomguides. Speak to Acolyte Neyman. She can tell you more.
The Undead and the Dying^3^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^The Missing Doomguides^A Doomguide's Duty^Rescue the Doomguides.^I believe the Red Wizards are purposely drawing priests of Kelemvor into Pauper's Field to capture for their rituals. Because of our special connection to the dead, sacrificing one of us would make whatever ritual they are performing all the more powerful. The journal you found belongs to Doomguide Awen. If she is correct, my remaining comrades are being take to the Soldier's Memorial. For their sakes and the safety of Neverwinter, we must save them.
Rest in Peace^3^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^Doomguide Volahk^Neverdeath Graveyard^The Missing Doomguides^A Doomguide's Duty^Plant a Banner of Kelemvor in the North Field, South Field, and West Field and slay the Risen Dead.^Valindra's allies, the Red Wizards of Thay, are raising the dead in large numbers. This is an abomination in the eyes of Kelemvor! The sacred grounds of this cemetery have been corrupted by the Red Wizards' foul rituals. Reconsecrating these grounds won't stop them, but it will slow them down. Take these banners and plant them in the North, South, and West plots of Pauper's Field. The power of Kelemvor will cleanse the area. It will also cause the dead who have already been lost to corruption to rise. Please send these poor souls back to their final rest.
Call to Arms^14^Captain Markath^The Chasm^Captain Markath^The Chasm^Descent Into the Chasm^Plaguefires Burning^Recover Weapon Caches and Supply Crates from the Broken Barracks.^The folks topside don't like dealing with us much for fear of catching the plague. We only really get supplies when we get new "recruits". The rest we have to scavenge from buildings here in the Chasm. We're running short on weapons and supplies to arm our soldiers. Real soon we'll be using rocks, stick and harsh language. You look pretty well armed. You think you can help? Head in into Broken Barracks to the northwest and recover whatever weapons and supplies you can find.
Plaguefires Burning^14^Captain Markath^The Chasm^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Call to Arms^Point of Pride, Fallen Heroes^Extinguish Plaguefires on the Burning Road then report to Lieutenant Trell at Fort Precipice.^We could really use someone like you at our forward base. I want you to report to Lieutenant Trell at Fort Precipice, but there is something you can do on your way. Maybe you've noticed those blue plaguefire geysers nearby? They're setting the ruins ablaze and spawning all kinds of plaguechanged creatures. If we don't do something soon, they'll overwhelm Scar Keep. Luckily, some of the recovered supplies included dwarven blasting runes! Tossing a rune into a plaguefire geyser should cause it to collapse. I'd be obliged if you'd knock out a few geysers on your way to Fort Precipice.
Point of Pride^14^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Plaguefires Burning^Quenching the Flames^Recover the Scar Company Banner lost on the field of battle.^Scar Company is a grim unit, but a proud one. We bore our company colors bravely into battle, but lost them in the fight when we were nearly overwhelmed. The loss of that banner feels like a personal insult to every soldier in this command. It would be a great boost to our faltering morale if you could recover it. If you manage to recapture the banner bring it here and raise it on the flagpole above the battlements, but be forewarned, the place where it now lies is guarded by some of the most formidable creatures we have yet faced.
Quenching the Flames^14^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Point of Pride, Fallen Heroes^Arcane Scryings^Head to the Plaguefire Ruins north of Fort Precipice and kill Trokar the Firestarter.^The plaguechanged creatures we face are formidable but their lack of organization has always given us a small advantage. But now that advantage has been lost. When we launched our attack against the plaguechanged we discovered they were being controlled by a creature called Trokar the Firestarter. Trokar is a potent spellcaster and savvy enough in the ways of war to control the mob of chaotic creatures he commands. Our scouts report that he has taken up residence in the ruins just north of here. If we hope to halt the advance of the plaguechanged Trokar must be eliminated.
Staring Contest^49^Private Sethrun^The Chasm^Private Sethrun^The Chasm^^^Kill 8 Blue Fire Eyes within the chasm.^Everyone who spends time here in the Chasm is bothered by nightmares. It gets so a guy doesn't want to sleep. Ya know? For me the nightmares are always the same. It's those Blue Fire Eyes... have you seen them? They're just horrible floating eyes... nothing but an eye... staring... staring right at ya! I can feel them staring at me... even behind the walls of the keep, I still feel it. They're staring at me. Mocking me! Do me a favor, will ya? Put out a few of those eyes! It might not stop the nightmares, but I'll rest just a little better.
Fallen Heroes^50^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Plaguefires Burning^Quenching the Flames^Mark the location of Fallen Soldiers so the bodies can be recovered.^Our chaplain Emrys has asked for aid in recovering the bodies of our comrades who fell in the last battle. I'm not going to risk more of my men without a good reason, but perhaps you can help Emrys. Speak with him to see if he has a plan.
The Icy Guardian^13^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^The Final Climb^Icespire's Frozen Heart^Slay The Rime Hound in the Rime Hound Den.^You've noticed the winter wolves in Hrimnir's army, yeah? Well, Rurik and I found out where they're coming from. Not only that, but we found their patriarch, the Rime Hound. This might be our only chance. The den is right nearby, and inside is the last major obstacle standing between us and the giants. Go in and kill that Rime Hound for me, would you?
To Remember the Fallen^48^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^The Icy Guardian^Reckoning^Retrieve the Icehammer flag from the fallen Rurik Hillhelm and place it at the Icespire gates.^Before you return to Florin, I need to ask a favor. Orreft selected me and Rurik to plant our flag atop Icespire Peak. They picked us because we're the best. But even we're not perfect. We got ambushed further up the mountain. Rurik didn't make it. I'd like to tell his family that his last mission was a success. If you could find Rurik's body, you could recover the flag and plant it right at the gates of that frost giant's home. If you could do that, I think Rurik would be pretty happy.
Reckoning^49^Erren Rockstrider^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^To Remember the Fallen^The Mithral Must Flow^Return to Florin Icehammer and inform him of your success in the Rime Hound Den.^Thanks for helping me out with Rurik's flag. Anyway, we need to let Florin know about the Rime Hound. I still have intel to gather up here at the peak, so it's up to you to deliver the news.
Retake What's Mine^46^Vaile Birchmsmith^Icespire Peak^Vaile Birchmsmith^Icespire Peak^^^Reclaim 5 pieces of Dwarven Mining Equipment in Icespire Peak.^There goblins harried our operations here for year, but we never expected them to attack in force like this. Our soldiers had to pull out from Prospector's Ridge to the southeast in a hurry, and they left almost all of the prospecting and mining tools behind. Those tools took our craftsmen months or even years to build, and now they're broken and half-salvaged by those damned goblins! We'd all be thankful if you went and brought us back as much of that equipment as you could. 
Prisoners of War^11^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Peril on Icespire Peak^The Goblin Warrens^Rescue the Captured Workers and gather Mining Tools in Icespire Peak.^There were still projects ongoing in Prospector's Ridge when the goblins attacked. My soldiers fought bravely, but had to retreat and couldn't protect all of the workers there. The scouts say many workers are being held captive. These men and women are essential to our efforts. Soldiers need weapons. The walls need to be maintained. The catapults need to be repaired. You save those workers, and our chances improve. The blasted goblins likely stole many of our tools as well. Bring back whatever you can find.
Winterkill Orders^46^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^^^Slay Frost Goblin Sentries, Skullcleavers and Hex Hurlers in Icespire Peak until you find Winterkill Orders on one of them.^These goblins are too organized. I've fought the little runts before and this isn't like them! Someone is directing them and I want to know who, bring me their battle orders! Hunt down their Sentries, Skullcleavers and thrice-damned Hex Hurlers. Those are what pass for officers among goblins, I suppose. If you can get those orders to us, it'd give us a big leg up on fighting the runts.
The Mother Lode^48^Discarded Journal^Icespire Peak^Vaile Birchsmith^Icespire Peak^^^Follow the Trail of Axes to find the Mother Lode.^The final entry in this miner's journal reads: The filthy little goblins are coming, and just when I finally struck it big! Found the ruby the size of me head encased in ice, but I wasn't able to cut it free in time. I'm retreating back to Torunedar with the others, but I'm not a fool. On me way out I left me best set of axes behind to point the way to the ruby. I'll leave me journal next to the last of them. If you can read common and you're no friend of the goblins, follow me axes and find the ruby. If you succeed and bring me the gem I'll reward you well!-Vaile Birchsmith
Last Line of Defense^46^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^^^Slay 3 Frost Goblin Skullcleavers in Icespire Peak.^Our front line are farther up in the mountain, and these opportunistic goblin runts decided it was a good time for a full-out attack on our back lines! Our reserves are holding them off, but we don't have enough soldiers to launch a counter-offensive. I've been tasking all volunteers I can find with mounting an assault on their tribal grounds. I'm worried about their Skullcleaver warriors; those are some tough goblins. Kill a few for me, would you?
The Goblin Warrens^11^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Prisoners of War^The Forward Front^Kill Murgal Mawcram in the Goblin Warrens.^These Winterkill goblins have us fighting on the defensive. We need to take the fight to them, but we don't have enough dwarves for a frontal assault. You, on the other hand, might be able to do what an army can't. We need you to infiltrate past the goblin lines, cut your way through their warrens, and kill the chieftain, Murgal Mawcram.
Playing Both Sides^46^Crate in Warrens^Icespire Peak^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^^Into the Fold^Inform Bolbin Ironbrow in Icespire Peak that someone has been selling ritual and magical weapons to the goblins.^The Crate is full of all kind of magical items. Crude hatchets and bows of goblin make have been enchanted with bolstering spells. It is no wonder that the Winterkill goblins are attacking Torunedar so boldly; they have been receiving magical assistance. Bolbin Ironbrow will likely be very thankful to learn of this.
Into the Fold^46^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Playing Both Sides^^Speak to Markos Rosznar in Icespire Peak about his double dealings.^I'd like to not distract any of my soldiers with this kind of task if I can avoid it, but someone has to set that wizard straight. We need his continued support, but he can't keep selling to our enemies. Go speak with Markos and let him know what you found. See if he's willing to cut us a deal.
The Forward Front^12^Bolbin Ironbrow^Icespire Peak^Belauk Forgearm^Icespire Peak^The Goblin Warrens^A Breath of Fresh Air^Investigate the Triage Camp in Icespire Peak.^We can handle the goblins here at Torunedar now thanks to your aid, but we still need your help. I haven't heard from my scout at the triage camp up on Windchill Reach in some time. I'm concerned that something may have happened, since we haven't been able to reinforce that front. Bring news of the camp to Belauk Forgearm further up the mountain once you find our what happened there. Good luck, adventurer.
Rimefire^47^Rimefire Shard^Icespire Peak^Nalias Greyguard^Icespire Peak^^^Speak to Nalias Greyguard in the Icehammer Triage Camp.^The magical Rimefire shard glitters and pulses with otherworldly energy. The alchemist, Nalias Greyguard, would likely be able to put this to some use.
Under Thin Ice^47^Garora Oakhew^Icespire Peak^Belauk Forgearm^Icespire Peak^Strange Alchemy^A Breath of Fresh Air^Free 4 Frozen Dwarves, then report to Belauk Forgearm.^The frost giant chieftain, Hrimnir, loves to show off his power at every opportunity. When his army captures one of our soldiers, he has them brought further up the mountain where he freezes them under a layer of ice, trapped but alive. We can't let our brave soldiers slowly die of thirst and hunger like that. You'll find a few of our frozen men a short ways further up the mountain, as well as a forward field operative, Belauk Forgearm. Go and break our soldiers out of their icy prisons, then report to Belauk.
Thinning the Pack^47^Garora Oakhew^Icespire Peak^Belauk Forgearm  ^^Strange Alchemy^^Slay 3 Winter Wolves near Glacier's Edge and 3 Winter Wolf Alphas near Icehammer Hall in Icespire Peak, then report to Belauk Forgearm.^Whenever our soldiers try to push forward, one of the key weapons the frost giants use against us is their pack of winter wolves. They wreak havoc in our soldier's ranks with their icy breath and they're too tough to overwhelm without serious losses. If you can go hunt a few of them down further up the mountain, we'll be more able to push forward. Be careful, some of them are the big alpha wolves. When you finish that task report to our forward field operative, Belauk Forgearm.
Killing the Messenger^47^Book ^Icespire Peak^Belauk Forgearm^Icespire Peak^^^Bring the orders from the troll nest to Belauk Forgearm.^The words on the pages of this book are difficult to make out, being ripped and smeared with mud and ice, but it seems that these are orders intended for an Icehammer scout named Belauk Forgearm, stationed further up the mountain. Surely he will be thankful to receive them.
Deviltry in Helm's Hold^31^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^^^Meet with Captain Dunfield outside of the battlefield south of Helm's Hold.^We've received disturbing reports that devil-worshipping cultists called the "Ashmadai" have taken over the fortress-city of Helm's Hold. When the trouble started, our forces there under Captain Dunfield tried to retake the city -- and failed. Only a handful of them survived. Helm's Hold is vital to Neverwinter. Not only does it protect our inland trade routes, but many of the city's spellscarred were sent to the sanatorium there for treatment. I need skilled adventurers to investigate the situation and defeat the cultists.
Death to the Devils!^31^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^^Take Out Their Leads, Arms of the Dead^Slay Imps on the battlefield sound of Helm's Hold.^When we tried to retake Helm's Hold from the Ashmadai cultists, they set an army of devils upon us. The fiends scour the battlefield like carrion birds, cutting us off from Brother Satarin and any surviving allies still within the city walls. Slay the devil imps on the battlefield, and then reach Brother Satarin with the news that help is coming. Show him the devils can be defeated.
Thin Their Numbers^31^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^^^Slay Hellfire Warlocks on the battlefield south of Helm's Hold.^Among the ranks of the Ashmadai are mad mages who have sold their souls for infernal power. These Hellfire Warlocks were a scourge to us on the battlefield, burning down my soldiers without mercy. If we are to retake Helm's Hold, we must strike at these vile zealots.
Arcane Scryings^15^Lieutenant Trell^The Chasm^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quenching the Flames^A Grave Task, Warped Magic^Meet with Quorthon at the Scrying Tower.^We have a squad deeper in the Chasm guarding a sun elf sorcerer named Quorthon, who is studying the Spellplague. He sends word he has gained insight into the "true nature of the Chasm" and requires further assistance. Quorthon created and maintains the magic portals that allow us to move around the Chasm. His research is vital to our mission. Follow the road downslope from Fort Precipice. You'll come to the first portal. Activate it and you'll travel to an earth mote where you can find Quorthon.
Warped Magic^15^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quorthon^The Chasm^Arcane Scryings^Foulspawn Foothold^Gather Warped Magic Items from the ruins of Arcanist Quarter.^I am in need of a magical power source to keep the warp gates running. Fortunately a number of magical relics can still be salvaged from the ruins of the old Arcanist Quarter. The bizarre energies emanating from the Chasm have rendered these items useless in regard to their original enchantments, however I can still make good use of their residual magical energy. My warp gates are the only things that make travel here in the Chasm possible, but to maintain them I need those magic items!
A Breath of Fresh Air^12^Belauk Forgearm  ^Icespire Peak^Belauk Forgearm  ^Icespire Peak^The Forward Front^The Icehammer^Clear Blocked Air Passages in Icespire Peak.^There are still survivors trapped in the mithral mines further up in the mountain. We've been trying to rescue them, but the frost giants are using some kind of ice magic to freeze over the air vents. If we don't get those open, the survivors will all suffocate. I've requisitioned some alchemist's fire from Nalias back at the camp. Here, take it and get those air vents open. The thought of our clanmates trapped down there, cold, alone, struggling for air... we can't let it happen.
Each Day Is Precious^51^Quorthon^The Chasm^Dorothea Linkletter^The Chasm^^^Gather the ingredients for a Spellplague Treatment^Your reputation precedes you, my friend. I believe you are just the person to assist a pair of Scar Company's more recent recruits. Be so good as to speak to Dorothea Linkletter. She will tell you more.
A Final Favor^51^Sergeant Danrick^The Chasm^Sergeant Danrick^The Chasm^^^Kill 5 Plaguechanged Soldiers in Apprentice Row.^Every soldier in Scar Company suffers from the Spellplague. Eventually the plague changes a person into something no longer human, something terrible. We all make a promise to our comrades: when the time comes and we cross the line, our brothers-in-arms will make an end of it for us. We have plaguechanged men over in Apprentice Row who need to be put out of their misery, but our orders are to guard the wizard, Quorthon. You can do us a favor by killing any plaguechanged soldier you encounter in Apprentice Row. It may seem harsh, but it's really an act of mercy.
The Icehammer^12^Belauk Forgearm  ^Icespire Peak^Belauk Forgearm^Icespire Peak^A Breath of Fresh Air^An Axe Too Far^Retrieve The Icehammer from the Mithral Mines.^The mithral mine over there isn't just a mine. It was going to be the Icehammer clan's new stronghold here on Icespire Peak. When the giants and their army overran us, we had to leave behind many of the treasures we'd stored there, including our greatest clan treasure, the Icehammer. I've received orders from our leader, Florin Icehammer, that the time has come to retrieve our clan's treasure. A full frontal assault with our army will do no good, though. It has to be one person or a small team who can infiltrate behind enemy lines. Sounds like a perfect job for you. What do you say?
An Axe Too Far^47^Belauk Forgearm  ^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^The Icehammer^Meltdown, Hrimnir's Hands, Words of Stone^Assist Florin Icehammer at the forward assault camp.^The Icehammer is back in our hands, thanks to you. However, we still don't have the military power the defeat their main army. That is why the Icehammer is so important. Our leader, Florin Icehammer, has brought a small band of elite warriors even further up the mountain. Bring the Icehammer to him, and he will explain further.
Meltdown^13^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^An Axe Too Far^The Final Climb^Destroy Ice Spires with Markos' orb.^Hrimnir is using the Winterforge to spread otherwordly coldness to all of Icespire Peak, and likely beyond as well. Further up the mountain, you'll find spire made of ice coming up out of the ground, freezing everything nearby. I want you to melt them. Here, take this orb. It's made by that scum of a wizard here to blackmail us out of our gold. I told him to make it specifically to destroy the ice spires. It wasn't cheap, but it works and it's simple to use. There are to many spires to destroy all of them, but every one destroyed buys us time.
Hrimnir's Hands^13^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^An Axe Too Far^The Final Climb^Kill the three frost giants known as Hrimnir's Hands.^With all the trouble you made for the giants down at Torunedar and the triage camp, Hrimnir ordered three of his top lieutenants to personally come oversee things up here. They're fanatically devoted to Hrimnir, and just as merciless and cruel. They call themselves "Hrimnir's Hands". They need to die. What do you say, adventurer? Feel like testing your mettle against some frost giants?
A Hand Above^48^Skrýmir's Beard  ^Icespire Peak^Erren Rockstrider  ^Icespire Peak^An Axe Too Far^^Give Skrýmir's Beard to Erren Rockstrider as proof that you have slain the leader of Hrimnir's Hands.^This beard is proof that you have slain Skrýmir, leader of Hrimnir's Hands. Certainly the Icehammer's will be pleased that he has been defeated.
The Mithral Must Flow^14^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^Sergeant Knox  ^The Adventurer's Guild^Icespire's Frozen Heart^How Enchanting^Return to the Protector's Enclave and convey the Icehammer Clan's thanks to Sergeant Knox.^You have turned the tides of battle on Icespire Peak, <player's name>. You have freed the Mithral Mine, given me back my hammer, slain our enemy's most deadly servents... You have done more than we could ever ask. Return to your friends in Neverwinter and tell them that they shall have the friendship and aid of the Icehamer Clan for as long as I draw breath.
Icespire's Frozen Heart^13^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer^Icespire Peak^The Icy Guardian^The Mithral Must Flow^Enter the frost giants' stronghold and slay Hrimnir, Frost Giant Chieftan.^You have helped us a great deal against the frost giants, friend. Not long ago, stopping their advance seemed hopeless, but now we are poised to strike at the very seat of Hrimnir's power. We will split their forces in three ways. Our army will keep the bulk of the trolls, goblins, and winter wolves occupied. I'll lead a small strike force and cripple the frost giants here in the white crags. I want you to take your own team into Hrimnir's stronghold itself. Once my mission is complete, I'll join you. But first, I want you to take up the banner from our fallen comrade and plant it at the doors of the stronghold. We must show we cannot be broken and we will not falter.
Bless the Fallen^31^Brother Theodosian^Helm's Hold^Brother Theodosian^Helm's Hold^Death to the Devils!^^Bless the bodies of dead Guardsmen on the Blasted Battlefield.^When the Ashmadai repulsed our attack, we had no time to gather our fallen. Now their bodies lie strewn across the battlefield, and the fiends will not allow us to gather our dead. My own powers are taxed to the limit just healing the living. I must ask for your aid to pray for the dead.
Descent Into the Chasm^14^Sergeant Knox  ^Protector's Enclave^Captain Markath  ^The Chasm^How Enchanting^Call to Arms^Meet with Captain Markath in the Chasm.^Not every threat to Neverwinter is as far flung as Icespire Peak. There is a very present danger right here in our own backyard. During the Cataclysm a huge rift in the earth opened beneath a portion of the city. We call it the Chasm, and it's a seemingly endless source of Plaguechanged monstrosities. The only thing standing between those creatures and the city is a unit known as Scar Company. I'm sure the soldiers of Scar Company would be grateful for any assistance you can offer. You should report to Captain Markath in the Chasm.
Brute Force^50^Sergeant Blackforge^The Chasm^Sergeant Blackforge^The Chasm^^^Kill 3 Nothic Brutes within the Chasm.^You arrived too late to join our counter-offensive against the creatures of the Chasm. Consider yourself lucky! We did pretty well at first, but then they brought up a pack of Nothic Brutes. Those beasties smashed our lines to pieces and cut down our spell casters... only a handful of us managed to retreat to this position. Now it looks like the enemy is gatherin' for an attack on the fort. We'll be hard pressed to resist 'em, especially if they have a strong force of Nothic Brutes in their vanguard. If you really want to help out, hunt down some Nothic Brutes.
Love In The Time of Spellplague^49^Private Olliver^The Chasm^Private Taliren^The Chasm^Quenching the Flames^^Gather Rift Roses in the Chasm to present to Private Taliren.^You wouldn't know it today, but Private Mara Taliren - was once a real heartbreaker. She was the toast of Neverwinter with a crowd of suitors around her. Then she became Spellscarred. She's bitter about the way her life turned out - it's gotta be hard for someone who was once so beautiful to change like that. I'd like her to remember what it's like to be adored, even for a moment. Would you pick some of the Rift Roses that grow around here and take them to her down at the Scrying Tower? Just tell her they're from an admirer.
Search and Rescue^51^Ril Ironlance^The Chasm^Ril Ironlance^The Chasm^^Weapon Salvage^Rescue 4 Captured Warriors from the Arcanist Quarter before they become plaguechanged.^Thank the gods! Did you get my call for reinforcement? Not that it matters... I'll take any help I can get at this point. The rest of my party have been captured by the Plaguechanged. I fear they're trying to turn the into more of those monster. We may have lost our last battle, but we were strong warriors all the same. If you can rescue my comrades, we may be able to strike back at the Plaguechanged. To my knowledge, they are being held in the Arcanist Quarter.
A Grave Task^15^Quorthon^The Chasm^Private Goodmark^The Chasm^Arcane Scryings^Foulspawn Foothold^Repair a broken Seal of Kelemvor in the Arcanist Quarter cemetery to drive out the undead.^I believe one of the members of Scar Company was looking for aid with an issue arising in the Arcanist Quarter. The twisted magic here is surely causing all manner of anomalies. See what you can do for Private Goodmark and return here when you're finished.
Avoiding Eye Contact^51^Cordi Nimblefingers^The Chasm^Cordi Nimblefingers^The Chasm^^^Kill 5 Nothic Plaguegazers in the Arcanist Quarter.^Am I glad to see you! I heard stories about how the Arcanist Quarter fell down here during the Cataclysm, and figured the whole place would be full of unclaimed magic trinkets. So I sneaked past those Scar Company guys to check it out. What a mistake! They only thing this place is full of is monsters! I'd sneak back to the surface except for those bug-eyed beasties... those Plaguegazers. I'm pretty sure they can spot you no matter how sneaky you are. If you could kill some of them off I could make a break for it. Could you do that? Please!
Weapon Salvage^51^Ril Ironlance^The Chasm^Ril Ironlance^The Chasm^Search and Rescue^Monstrous Melee^Search the recent battlefields in the Chasm for Discarded Weapons.^You've saved us from complete failure, but most of us have lost our weapons. There's still work to be done here and we'll need weapons to get it done. Fortunately, the Chasm has seen plenty of battles. I expect you can find some slightly used weapons all over down here. If you're able to bring me five useable specimens, we might manage to mount something resembling a counter-offensive.
Take Out Their Leads^31^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Death to the Devils!^^Slay Legion Devils on the battlefield south of Helm's Hold.^The Asmadai cultists claim that their Legion Devils are invincible in battle, and even my soldiers began to believe it and lose heart. We must show one and all that this is not true! I ask you to slay the Legion Devils who prowl the Blasted Battlefield to prove that even devils can die. When that is done, make your way to Brother Satarin at the gates of Scar Alley, and bring word that help is here.
Arms of the Dead^31^Captain Dunfield^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Death to the Devils!^Healing the Scar, Suffer the Poisoners^Search the battlefield for usable weapons, and then take them to Brother Satarin.^Our allies in Scar Alley need weapons to fight the devils and their Ashmadai cultists. My dead soldiers can no longer use their blades, but perhaps our allies can. I want you to collect the weapons of the dead from the battlefield and take what you can find up to Brother Satarin in the Underscar.
Healing the Scar^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Arms of the Dead^^Use Holy Antidote to purify the Wells in Scar Alley.^The vile Ashmadai want to make the poor, sick people of the Underscar suffer even more by poisoning their water supply. I still have a few vials of a holy antidote that can purify the wells, but the fiends are always watching me. They won't let me get in close enough to bless the water. If you can use the antidote on the wells for me, it could save many lives.
Suffer the Poisoners^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Arms of the Dead^Escape from Scar Alley, The Treacherous Scum^Get samples of poison from Ashmadai in Scar Alley.^Scar Alley was always filled with the sick and the poor, but now this plague of devils has made a bad situation even worse. Those already sickened will need a cure, but with Helm's power all but gone, I'll need to rely on my medicinal skills to help them. If I'm to find an antidote, I'll need you to wrest samples of the poison from the Ashmadai themselves.
Devil's Council^32^Corlan Graves^Helm's Hold^Corlan Graves^Helm's Hold^^^Rescue Councilman Graves.^My brother is Councilman Aldwin Graves, an important man whose word carries great weight in Helm's Hold. This makes him a valuable prize to the Ashmadai, and I've learned they have plans to abduct my brother and force him to join their cult. I tried to warn Aldwin of the danger, but he is a stubborn man, and refuses to leave his home in Scar Alley. Please, can you go to my brother's house and make sure he and his wife are not abducted by devils?
Foulspawn Foothold^15^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quorthon^The Chasm^A Grave Task, Warped Magic^Cathedral of Madness^Destroy foulspawn gates by shattering the Plague Crystals that power them.^While we are on the topic of gates and portals, there is another urgent matter you can help us with. It seems the foulspawn of the Chasm are attempting to build gates of their own. Such gates would allow them to bring hordes of aberrant creatures against Scar Keep. I have sensed a spike in arcane energy emanating from a nearby earthmote. This can only mean that the foulspawn gates are nearing completion. These gates are powered by Plague Crystals. If these crystals are destroyed the gates will be closed. For the sake of Neverwinter, smash those Plague Crystals!
Madmen and Fools^51^Private Taliren^The Chasm^Private Taliren^The Chasm^^^Kill 12 Blue Fire Cultists in the Unhallowed Grounds.^Can you believe it? Most people flee at the mere mention of the Spellplague, but there are some deluded fools who actually seek to embrace it! They call themselves the Order of Blue Fire and their goal is to spread the Spellplague in the name of enlightenment. Honestly, I don't know where they find madmen like these! There is a whole pack of them over in the Unhallowed Grounds right now seeking to "embrace the change". I think they need to embrace a few arrows before they cause some real harm. What do you say? Ready to rid the world of a few fools?
Monstrous Melee^51^Ril Ironlance^The Chasm^Captain Markath^The Chasm^Weapon Salvage^None^Defeat the Plaguechanged Monstrosity on the northern edge of the Unhallowed Grounds before it can assault Scar Keep.^Now that we've got our party together and armed ourselves, I have some bad news. The plaguechanged monster that defeat us was not of the usual size. It was gigantic and terrible! I fear they are growing it to breach the defenses of Scar Keep. We were defeated before, but with your help, perhaps we can bring it down. Are you with us?
Cathedral of Madness^15^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quorthon^The Chasm^Foulspawn Foothold^Chaotic Depths^Kill Senobith the Corruptor in the Cathedral of Madness.^The Order of Blue Fire, under their false prophetess Senoblith the Corruptor, is spreading a message of submission in the face of the Spellplage. Senobith must be dealt with, but she stays hidden within the ruins of the old Cathedral of Mystra, sealed by powerful magical wards. Acolytes can pass these wards with the aid of a magical talisman. Slay the Acolytes of Corruption and search them for a Blue Flame Talisman, then use it to enter the cathedral. Senobith will be protected by even stronger spells inside. She does not trust any single one of her followers with the means to summon her from her lair, but if you slay all her lieutenants and capture their talismans you will have the means to call her forth and put an end to her evil.
Chaotic Depths^16^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Cathedral of Madness^Crystal Clarity^Meet with Quorthon's Astral Projection at the Mystic Grotto.^With Senobith dead and the Blue Fire Accordance crippled, the way is now clear for you to continue your investigations deep within the Chasm. I dare not go myself, for if the gates were to fail in my absence we would be trapped in the chaotic depths below. You will not be without guidance however, for I will send a part of my consciousness through the astral plane. Travel to the final gate located on the Unhollowed Ground mote; it will take you deeper into the Chasm. Look for my Astral Projection in the place called the Mystic Grotto.
A Well Chronicled Tragedy^53^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Chaotic Depths^Closer to the Source^Gather Adventurer's Journals from Plaguechanged Adventurers and their abandoned camps.^As you may have deduced from the presence of our menial friend over there, you are not the first adventurer to pass this way. A rather large expedition came before you, but alas, it appears they met with disaster. Hardly surprising really. They were all swagger and bravado and no substance. Nonetheless, any notes or record they kept might provide important information--for all their shortcomings the average adventurer seems to be quite keen on keeping a record of their deeds. Ego, I suppose. At any rate, be sure to gather up any journals you may discover.
Crystal Clarity^16^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Chaotic Depths^Closer to the Source^Gather Plague Crystals in the Crystal Caves.^These caves mark the limit of my investigation into the Chasm. I had begun to study the unusual crystal formations within these caverns but relentless attacks by plaguechanged creatures drove me to seek refuge in the Scrying Tower. It is my belief that certain of these crystals have the power to hold and store Spellplague energy. If so, they could hold the key to our salvation... or our destruction. Please gather some crystal samples for me to examine through my astral projection.
Under Contract^53^Hal the Henchman^The Chasm^Hal the Henchman^The Chasm^^^Search Plaguechanged Adventurers for Hal's Henchman Contract.^Good to see a friendly face. I'm in a real fix! I ain't seen any of my employers since they went off to look at that big glowin' rock--leastwise, I ain't seen 'em like they was! The Chasm has a way of changin' folks! I'd hightail it out of here 'cept if I go back to the Henchman's Guild without my contract they'll say I deserted my employers and throw me out of the Guild. Maybe you could find my contract on one of my old employers. I'm pretty sure you won't get the chance to ask them nicely though, they've gotten pretty... well... surly.
Closer to the Source^16^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Crystal Clarity^Source of Corruption^Travel to the Jagged Approach and speak to Quorthon's Astral Projection.^My examination of the plague crystals and the journals you brought me seem to confirm my suspicions that the source of the corruption here in the Chasm emanates from the Twisted Fane-the brightly glowing stone that hangs above this region. It is time to take this investigation to the next level. I am sending my astral projection to that region called Jagged Approach, which lies beyond the Crystal Caverns.
No Honor Among Thieves^16^Thief's Ledger^The Chasm^Auto Complete^The Chasm^^^Seek out the dead thief's secret stash of stolen treasures.^An examination of this battered ledger shows it to be a record of treasure stolen by the dead rogue from her own party members. According to some scribbled notes the thief stashed her ill-gotten goods in an ancient urn for later recovery. A hastily drawn map on the back cover may well lead you to the spot.
Guardians of the Fane^53^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Closer to the Source^Source of Corruption^Kill 5 Plaguechanged Maws within the Jagged Approach.^The greatest threat to my studies here in the Caverns of Chaos are the abominations known as Plaguechanged Maws. My arts will usually allow me to defeat the other Plaguechanged creatures that infest this place, but I am not ashamed to admit those monstrosities are too much for me. I would be very grateful if you could thin the numbers of Plaguechanged Maws here in the caverns. Perhaps then I will be able to resume my studies in a more corporal form.
Foul Pilgrimage^53^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Closer to the Source^^Kill Foulspawn pilgrims who have gathered at the foot of the Twisted Fane.^This is indeed a disturbing development, <name>. Foulspawn are gathering in the Jagged Approach in great numbers. From their behavior it is clear that they have come to venerate the Twisted Fane in a grotesque mockery of a pilgrimage. Granting worship to such evil can only lead to trouble. You would be doing the world a favor if you were to destroy the foulspawn pilgrims infesting this area.
Source of Corruption^16^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Closer to the Source^Chasm Report^Eliminate the source of the Corruption within the Twisted Fane.^This is indeed a disturbing developement, <name>. Foulspawn are gathering in the Jagged Approach in great numbers. From their behavior it is clear that they have come to venerate the Twisted Fane in a grotesque mockery of a pilgrimage. Their gathering is feeding some sort of protective barrier in the Fane, bolstered particularly by those Plaguechanged Maws. If we are to get to the bottom of this we must gain access to the Twisted Fane and put a stop to the source of the corruption, whatever it may be. Defeat the Maws and enter the Twisted Fane.
Chasm Report^17^Quorthon's Astral Form^The Chasm^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Source of Corruption^Artifacts and Insignias^Meet with Sergeant Knox in the Protector's Enclave.^Thanks for your heroic efforts here in the Chasm my research into the Spell plague can continue. Furthermore, you have inspired the members of Scar Company giving the hope and encouragement to continue their fight.  I think the time has come for you to return to Sergeant Knox. He will certainly want to know what we have discovered here.
Rods, Staves, and Wands^11^Interact with book in Market Square^Tower District^Riftel Farsight^Tower District^^^Collect a Rod, Stave and Wand from the Merchant Square in the Tower District.^Journal of Fineas Verran, 29th Tarsakh, 1385 DR. With my rod, staff and wand near at hand I feel practically invincible! The array of useful spells at my fingertips is very nearly intoxicating, which makes it all the worse to have lost all three! I cannot believe I was so clumsy! I must have dropped the rod near the Merchant's Guild hall when I set it aside to barter. The wand must have slipped from my satchel along the road... And the staff, I know I had it with me when I stopped to rest on a rocky outcropping. Perhaps I left it there? As soon as I catch my breath, I must retrace my steps and find them. Hmm, what's that sound?
Strange Allies^10^Riftel Farsight^Tower District^Hulgen Proudfist^Tower District^^Test of Strength, Test of Guile, Test of Wisdom^Find the "Proudfist Tribe" in the Tower District and gain their trust.^Would you believe that most of the mercenaries out here think me mad for trying to forge alliances with half-orc barbarians? I really can't quite wrap my head around it. These "barbarians", the Proudfist tribe, are currently retained by the Many-Arrows. Though the Proudfists fight against Neverwinter now, I believe they could be convinced to abandon their cruel masters and join us in freedom. There is just one problem. They don't trust me! It seems my timidity makes me appear weak. Perhaps you could convince them that Neverwinter is stronger than the Many-Arrows.
Test of Strength^12^Hulgen Proudfist^Tower District^Hulgen Proudfist^Tower District^Strange Allies^Stand Your Ground^Prove your strength to Hulgen Proudfist by slaying the ogre Thag Slabhead.^As the leader of my tribe, it falls to me to look to our strength. Our allies must too be string! If you wish to prove yourself to me, you could best Thag Slabhead, an ogre who guards the road nearby. He is monstrously strong in body, but as I am sure you half-elves know, there is more than one kind of strength. Demonstrate yours, and you will gain my respect.
Test of Guile^12^Dulgan Proudfist^Tower District^Dulgan Proudfist^Tower District^Strange Allies^Stand Your Ground^Prove your guile to Dulgan Proudfist by retrieveing the "Trinkets" he has hidden amidst the orcs.^Ah, so you'd like to earn our respect. Hulgen respects strength most, and Chalik respects wisdom, but me? I respect guile and cunning above all. There are so many things that go overlooked in the world, little things kept even in plain sight. I delight in hiding little caches of trinkets right under the noses of our orc allies. If you can find three such trinkets, I will be impressed.
Test of Wisdom^12^Chalik Proudfist^Tower District^Chalik Proudfist^Tower District^Strange Allies^Stand Your Ground^Prove your wisdom to Chalik Proudfist.^Hulgen has sent you to me to prove your wisdom? Well... The truth is halfelf... You have nothing to prove here, for I know you already. My visions show me much, and they tell me that you will help guide the Proudfist tribe to glory beyond our wildest dreams. You have my support halfelf, as it was destined. I will tell Hulgen that I trust you, but I do have a task you can assist me with. If we are to join your new Neverwinter, your guards must be informed whose side we are on. Please go to your Captain Janros and tell him that we are not your enemy.
Stand Your Ground^12^Hulgen Proudfist^Tower District^Hulgen Proudfist^Tower District^Test of Strength, Test of Guile, Test of Wisdom^^Help the Proudfist tribe defeat their Many Arrows Overseers.^You wish us to change our allegience, to cast off the shackles of the Many-Arrows? We have chafed too long under full-blood oppression, and we are ready to fight for our freedom. Your words have convinced me that my tribe may be accepted in Neverwinter, and I will trust you. There is just one last thing that I will ask of you. The Many-Arrows overseer responsible for us will be arriving shortly with his warriors. Join us in the glorious battle for our freedom! Shed blood with the Proudfists!
Escape from Scar Alley^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Suffer the Poisoners^^Break boarded up doors on houses to help refugees escape Scar Alley.^The Ashmadai are trying to make an example of anyone they catch trying to escape. They board them up in their homes to slowly starve. We must free these poor doomed souls. Break down the barricaded doors and release those trapped inside!
The Treacherous Scum^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Suffer the Poisoners^The Underscar^Kill Branded Zealots in Scar Alley.^The worst moment of the Ashmadai's triumph was when their Zealots revealed themselves. Men whom we had thought were our neighbors and friends suddenly exposed the brands which proved them traitors and fanatics. We were all caught unaware as they attacked, slaying those who had trusted them while uttering blasphemous prayers to a fiend. Those Branded Zealots have known no justice for their treachery. I would see this rectified.
The Fire Lords^58^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^^^Defeat 3 of Gommoth's 6 Fire Giant Generals.^Gommoth is not the only fire giant who worships the Primordial and seeks to free it. Among his forces are powerful giants who act as his generals and guard the Caldera. You'll need to bring down some of them if you're to have any chance of getting into the Temple of the Primordial. 
Watching it Burn^58^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^^^Place Scrying Orbs.^Gommoth's goal is to free a powerful elemental being called a Primordial which he thinks is buried beneath Mt. Hotenow. We need to know what his forces are planning, and watch their movements. I've got some scrying orbs that will let us spy on them, but I'm going to need your help to place them inside the Caldera.
He Who Watches^14^Image of Dyrl Godsword^Tower District^Image of Dyrl Godsword^Tower District^^The Rage Mystic^Locate and collect Gruumsh Idols in the Many-Arrows Camp in the Tower District.^The spirits move through me, pious one. They show me a terrible beast whose rage cannot be contained. They show me a fire that burns across the ruins of the city of Neverwinter.... These visions take a lot out of me. God of rage? That's Gruumsh, the father of orcs and lord of storms. Many-Arrows orcs are invading the Tower District. Perhaps among them is the fire that burns the city? Bring me three Gruumsh idols. I'll confirm it's a Gruumsh worshipper the gods are mad about, and we'll decide what to do next. What do you say?
The Rage Mystic^14^Image of Dyrl Godsword^Tower District^Image of Dyrl Godsword^Tower District^He Who Watches^^Locate and defeat Gruuman Xuluksh in the Tower District.^The gods warn that the orcs indeed have the blessing of Gruumsh for this invasion. They are lead in worship by an aged veteran orc, Gruuman Xuluksh. This orc has been feeding his god with the blood of vanquished foes for too long. As Gruumsh gluts himself on ill-gotten spoils, he grows bold and threatens the balance of the cosmos. The benevolent gods will no longer tolerate this. To slay an enemy is a macabre act, but when it must be done, let it be done swiftly and without remorse. Kill Gruuman Xuluksh and end this divine travesty.
Returning the Fire^58^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Temple of the Primordial^^Return to Sgt. Knox in Protector's Enclave^Neverwinter needs to know everything that's happened here. You've defeated Gommoth and kept him from awakening the Primordial, but Maegera is still a danger. The city needs to know.
Guardsman for a Day^11^Guard Recruiter, Tower District^Tower District^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^^Broken Barricades^Speak to Sergeant Creed in the Tower District about tasks as a Neverwinter Guard.^You look like you know how to handle a sword. I'm sure you know just how many threats Neverwinter is facing, so it's no surprise that the Neverwinter Guard is short on warriors. We've been working alongside mercenaries and adventurers like yourself, but hired help isn't enough. There are tasks that we're only allowed to assign to members of the Guard. The long and short of it is that we need more hands. If you're interested in working for the Guard, talk to Sergeant Creed further up the road. He'll tell you about the temporary positions we're offering.
Broken Barricades^11^Sergeant Creed^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^ Guardsman for a Day, Saving the Guards, Ending the Torture^Containment^Inspect the Barricades at the exits to Pedlar's Path to prepare for future action in that area.^All right, Corporal, you've proven yourself. The next task I have for you is less glamorous, but necessary. When we first pulled out of Pedlars Path, we built barricades around that area's three exits. Unfortunately the orcs have advanced and those old barricades are now behind enemy lines. For our plans in Pedlars Path to work, we need to know the status of those barricades. I want you to go to the three entrances to Pedlar's Path and inspect whatever remains of those barricards then report your findings to Captain Janros at the guard post to the east.
Containment^12^Captain Janros^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Broken Barricades^^Inspect the Southwest Wall of the Tower District on the south side of Merchant Square.^At this point, our chief objective is to contain the orcs here in the Tower District and to prevent them from spreading further. We have people guarding the gates and manning the walls to ensure that the Many-Arrows can't move into any other districts in force. Every so often, however, the orcs attempt to undermine or otherwise destroy the district walls. There have been reports of just such activity on the wall to the southwest. Go there and inspect it for signs of damage, then return here so I can assess whether an engineering crew will need to be sent.
Guarding Gord^12^Skeld Steelhelm^Tower District^Gord Roundshield^Tower District^^The Black Eye^Locate Gord Roundshield in the Tower District.^I'm glad you're here. A handful of heroes from the dwarfholds of the North have come to Neverwinter to help you folk deal with your troubles. We hail from Citadel Felbarr, Citadel Adbar, Sundabar, and my own Mithral Hall. I've been trying to direct our strength where it is most needed. Alas, Gord Roundshield from Citadel Felbarr discovered there were Many-Arrows here. Naturally he's gone to slay as many as he can. Do me a favor and lend him a hand? Tell him I need him back here alive. I last saw him heading to the Market Square in the Tower District.
The Black Eye^12^Gord Roundshield^Tower District^Gord Roundshield^Tower District^Guarding Gord^In Due Time^Set fire to the Shrine of Gruumsh to flush out and kill the Black Eye in the Tower District.^If you don't mind helping me with a small matter of honor, I'll head back to old Steelhelm. I got careless and let one of those big Eyes of Gruumsh stick me in the gut. It's just a flesh wound, but he got away. Now he can tell all his orc toadies that he stabbed Gord Roundshield and lived! He calls himself he Black Eye and stands vigil over a Shrine to Gruumsh west of Merchant Square. If you set fire to his shrine, I guarantee he'll show himself. Kill him, and I'll leave the rest of these orcs for later.
In Due Time^12^Gord Roundshield^Tower District^Skeld Steelhelm^Tower District^The Black Eye^^Speak with Skeld Steelhelm in the Tower District.^A deal's a deal. Tell Skeld I'll be done shortly, and let him know not to worry. I'm not going to fall over dead just because some orcs take swings at me. Go on then.
Mapping the Underdark^59^Elben Meridius^Whispering Caverns^Elben Meridius^Whispering Caverns^Into the Underdark^^Collect 10 Underdark Maps from the denizens of Northdark.^The Guild has compiled the most complete atlas of the Underdark in existence, but there is an immense area yet to be charted. So, as you may imagine, we are always pleased to build on reliable cartographic work already done by the Underdark's various races. To put it bluntly, we steal maps from the bad folks found down here. As you travel through these Caverns keep your eyes open for any maps and charts you may find on fallen foes and or their camps and settlements. Bring these to me and I will see you are rewarded for your contribution.
Raiders of Rothé Valley^52^Dassar Truebow^Rothé Valley^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^^Pulled from the Web, Ledgers of Cruelty^Kill the Drow Slavers in Rothé Valley.^Drow slavers are conducting raids all throughout Rothé Valley, and my rangers are too few in number to confront them directly. My second in command, Imbross Irri'Karr, is working on a plan, but he needs time to get all the pieces into place. If you were to slay some of the drow slavers in the farmlands to the west of here, that may delay them long enough. Go and do just that, then find Imbross Irri'Karr to the southwest of the farmlands and help him any way you can.
Scouting for Rangers^52^Dassar Truebow^Rothé Valley^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^^Pulled from the Web, Ledgers of Cruelty^4 Rangers sent into the Rothé Valley to gather information on the drow have not returned. Search for them, then report their state to Imbross Irri'karr, the second in command.^I've sent a number of rangers into the farmlands to the west to gather information, but several of them have not reported back, and I fear the worst. I need you to find out what happened to them. I ordered my rangers to report to my second in command, Imbross Irri'Karr, once they completed their task. If you find any of my rangers, report their status to Irri'Karr.
Assassin Search^53^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^^^Search for and take down drow Assassins throughout Rothé Valley.^Well met Adventurer! My cast has a vendetta against the assassins of my kind, but my duties here do not allow me to currently hunt them. I would consider you a comrade in arms if you would search out and destroy any assassin you come across.
Pulled from the Web^53^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Scouting for Rangers^The Night Raid^Enter the drow slave outpost through the Secret Passage. There, open Weapon Caches and tell the Village Leaders the plan.^It would take an army to free the captured villagers, but if we arm these captives and tell them to wait for our signal, they can be that army. Fortunately, I know of a secret way into the camp. I'll need you to use the secret passage into the drow slave camp, then open caches of captured weapons you'll find there and tell the village leaders about the plan. The secret passage is north of our forward camp here, as is the drow's slaving outpost.
Ledgers of Cruelty^53^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Scouting for Rangers^The Night Raid^Kill Drow Slavekeepers and find Slave Ledgers.^Another slave caravan is due to arrive from the Underdark soon. We need to know when, but that information is located inside the drow slave outpost to the north of here. To get it, you'll have to enter the drow slave outpost and search for Slave Ledgers. While you're at it, kill some of the drow Slavekeepers who guard the slave pens. They may also have Slave Ledgers on them. And don't forget to use the secret passage north of here. It's the only safe way in or out.
The Night Raid^53^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Pulled from the Web, Ledgers of Cruelty^A Hero in Hiding^Use the Wagon behind Imbross to sneak into the slave camp at night, then open the Slave Pens and kill Malaggath the Slaver Lord.^With the information you've gathered, I've been able to pin down when the next slaver caravan will arrive, and it's tonight! I've prepared the cart behind me to sneak you inside. Once there, the captives are armed and ready to attack once you throw open the gates. That should draw out Malaggath the Slaver Lord and give you a chance to finish him off.
A Hero in Hiding^52^Imbross Irri'Karr^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^The Night Raid^Clearing the Nest, A Village in the Webs^Meet with Mayor Gunderson, Rothé Valley's leader and a former adventurer.^The drow still believe I'm one of them, and they think the raid last night was organized by Rothé Valley's mayor, a former adventurer named Morgan Gunderson. I spoke to the people you rescued, and I've found out where he's hiding. I need to stay here and keep an eye on the camp, but you should find Mayor Gunderson. He may know more about what the drow are planning. He's located at his old family farm. It's south of here, reachable by the old tunnel to the east.
Rattling Doors^54^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^^^Check Village Doors in Rothé Valley Village to make sure they are securely boarded up.^Friend, if I might impose upon you. Many of the villagers were able to barricade up their houses before fleeing the village. Inside the houses lay most of the village harvest for the year. Since you are heading towards the village, could you do me the kindness and check some of the doors to the houses-make sure they are still boarded up? The spiders are frightful, but I don't think they can get into a locked house, and once this is over, we will need that food.
Clearing the Nest^54^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^A Hero in Hiding^The Deathweavers, Shroud of the Spider-Queen^Rescue Captive Villagers and kill the giant spider called the Daughter of Lolth keeping them trapped.^These blasted drow have turned our homes and businesses into a giant spider's nest. And even worse, they're holding innocent civilians captive, first to use as slaves, and then to feed to the spiders. When I was in my prime, I could have handled it, but that was a long time ago. I need help to save them. Your help.
A Village in the Webs^54^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^A Hero in Hiding^^Kill Spiders in Rothé Valley.^The drow have set their spiders to weaving, covering the village in webs and trapping anyone left in their homes inside. If you can go kill some of those spiders, I can get some of those folks out of there. Killing them in the village south of there is best, but honestly, dead spiders anywhere in Rothé Valley will help.
The Deathweavers^54^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Clearing the Nest^The Edge of the Underdark^Slay Deathweavers and take their Ritual Books.^The drow brought a bunch of their  priestesses with them from the Underdark. "Deathweavers", I think they're supposed to be called. For a while now they've been working some strange ritual all over the village. I have no idea what it'll do, but whatever it is you can be sure that it won't be good for us. Head into the village and slay as many of these Deathweavers as you can find. Stop the ritual. Maybe you can even find out what it is that they were planning to do.
Shroud of the Spider-Queen^54^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Clearing the Nest^The Edge of the Underdark^Destroy the Shroud Spinners in Rothé Valley Village.^Right after the attack, the drow set up these strange devices in the village. These "Shroud Spinners" shoot some kind of magic into the air, forming the web of darkness that's covering the village. That web is getting bigger, but destroying the Shroud Spinners might slow its growth down, or even stop it. The Shroud Spinners can be found along the river to the east and west, as well as in the town to the south. They'll always be guarded, so keep your guard up.
The Edge of the Underdark^55^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^The Deathweavers, Shroud of the Spider-Queen^Spiderwebs Swept, The High Priestess of Lolth^Slay Sarkon'Iss, leader of the drow expedition.^The commander of this drow attack is a drider named Sarkon'Iss. As long as he's in charge, we don't have much of a chance of driving the drow back. But if there's one thing I know about drow, it's that they love to backstab each other. If you can take Sarkon'Iss down, the invasion might stall as all of his lieutenants start vying for power. It won't be easy. You'll have to fight your way to the very edge of the Underdark. But then again, I've seen you fight. If anyone can do it, it's you.
Spiderwebs Swept^54^Mayor Gunderson^Rothé Valley^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^^^Return to Sergeant Knox in Protector's Enclave to tell him what you've done.^With the death of Sarkon'Iss, the drow expedition is faltering. Neverwinter needs to know what happened here, and I'm sure they have more urgent tasks for you.
Pilfered Supplies^21^Cecil Proudfoot^Blackdagger Ruins^Cecil Proudfoot^Blackdagger Ruins^^Ghostwise Aid^Cecil has hasked you to recover stolen Supplies and Building Materials from the Blackdagger Bandits.^With the reclaiming of Neverwinter, halflings from all over the north have begun to migrate to the area and begin rebuilding. Unfortunately, the High Road is infested with bandits. Many of our kin have lost their supplies and their coin on the road. I've done a little information gathering, and I believe I know where each of the recent caravans were ambushed. If you wouldn't mind teaching some bandits a lesson, you could visit the ambush sites and recover the stolen supplies. I've set aside some funds for the task, and you're welcome to them if you succeed!
Ghostwise Aid^30^Cecil Proudfoot^Blackdagger Ruins^Gilern Ghostwise^Blackdagger Ruins^Pilfered Supplies^Gnoll Mercy!^Find the Ghostwise Halflings hiding near the Merchant Campsite in Blackdagger Ruins and recruit them to your cause.^Thanks to your efforts, halflings in New Neverwinter will be able to build their homes. There are still more migrants traveling the High Road, however, and we halflings must do our part to keep it safe. One of the merchants mentioned that he'd seen a bunch of 'feral midgets' out in the wilds. I suspect he might have seen a band of Ghostwise. Our insular cousins aren't the most social of halflings, but if they've moved into the area, perhaps they will join our cause in keeping it safe for travellers. Seek them out, and see if they will help us.
Gnoll Mercy!^31^Gilern Ghostwise^Blackdagger Ruins^Gilern Ghostwise^Blackdagger Ruins^Ghostwise Aid^^Collect 8 Gnoll Fangs from Gnolls between the Merchant Campsite and the Mines in Blackdagger Ruins.^You find us in a difficult position. The bandits shot one of my clansmen during a raid. He'll live, but we can't move him without alerting the Gnoll Bloodtrackers. Even if we stay put, they'll scent us out eventually. We're in no shape to fight them yet, but if you kill those gnolls and buy us time to recover, we'll help your traveling friends.
Warm Earth^56^Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^^^Destroy Elemental Flamespikers to collect Elemental Clay.^The seeds you found for me will need some help if they are ever to grow strong. Geologist Darney has told me that the bodies of elemental monsters called Flamespikers contain a very rich kind of clay that could both protect the seeds, and spur their growth. Could you help me once more by harvesting some of this elemental clay?
The Spider Queen's Faithful^59^Cole Rivers^Whispering Caverns^Cole Rivers^Whispering Caverns^Hunters in the Dark^^Collect 16 Symbols of Lolth from the Drow in the Whispering Caverns and kill at least one Drow War Leader.^The Drow knows that many of us escaped from the skirmish in Zesraena, and I'm willing to bet they also know we're still hanging around. Sooner or later it's going to come to a fight again and I'd like to see our odds improve. If you were to take out one of their War Leaders and a bunch of his followers it would really help our changes of coming out on the good side of that fight. Bring me a bunch of the symbols of Lolth the Drow usually wear and I'll know you've been doing good work. 
The Overseers^18^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^The Payoff, A Winch In Their Plans^Wrathforge^Kill a Mind Flayer Overseer in the Crucible.^Poor Mandrake's revelation about the mind flayer involvement confirms a report I got from Hollie Tinkerstone, one of our scouts. She claimed that "squid-headed monsters" were overseeing the duergar operation in the Crucible. Maybe you should head over there and bring down a mind flayer overseer. With any luck you can nip this plot in the bud.
An Audience with the Protector^20^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^The Loose Thread^Boons, Campaigns, and Adventures^Speak to Lord Neverember^Good news, <name>! Your many efforts on behalf of the city of Neverwinter have not gone unnoticed by the Lord Protector. Oghma knows, I've sung your praises to him often enough. Lord Neverember wishes to thank you personally. He has granted you an audience and wishes to speak to you in the Hall of Justice at your first convenience. I wouldn't keep him waiting!
The Mystery of Sharandar^60^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Iliyasha Guidingstar^Protector's Enclave^^To the Farthest Forest, Sharandar Rewards ^Meet with Envoy Iliyasha Guidingstar, the envoy from New Sharandar near the ruins southwest of the Hall of Justice^A strange elven envoy has recently arrived here in Neverwinter. She and her guards have set up camp at the old ruins on the edge of the Enclave. We don't know why they're here, only that they've asked to speak to you my name. Something tells me they've come a long way to seek your help.
The Arcane Reservoir^70^Merrisara Winterwhite^Sharandar^^Sharandar^Tomorrow and Tomorrow^^Enter the Arcane Reservoir above New Sharandar and repel the Dark Fey Incursion.^Corellon preserve us! Malabog's dark fey have stolen into the Arcane Reservoir above Sharandar! All the arcane energy we harvest to power our wards and magic is stored there. If the dark fey disrupt it, we will be defenseless! Please, we must drive them out of the Reservoir. Use the portal behind me to enter the temple. Blessings of the Protector go with you, hero of Neverwinter. 
Masters of Filth^70^Gathir Trueshot^Sharandar^Gathir Trueshot^Sharandar^The Dark Fey Enclave^^Kill 10 Troll Runts and 3 Fell Trolls in the Putrid Fen area of Dark Fey Enclave in Sharandar.^Malabog's troll allies spend their days poisoning the river, defiling it with endless torrents of toxic residue. Water that once ran pure and clear is now sodden with the waste from the fomorian witches' brewing. Even if the trolls were not Malabog's allies, such corruption of our land is a crime punishable by death. Strike down the filthy creatures wherever you find them. Return to me on a path paved with their dead.
The Blighted Grove^70^Merrisara Winterwhite^Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^Sharandar^To the Farthest Forest^Feydark Crystals^Pass through the Wyldwood Gate, speak to Pelendethas Everstride, and collect 3 Vibrant Seedlings in the Blighted Grove of Sharandar.^I requested your aid, but to many of my people you are an outsider... not to be trusted. You must prove them wrong. You must aid us in our campaign to drive the accursed Malabog back into the Feydark where he belongs. To the west is the Blighted Grove, diseased by the wicked influence of the dark fey. It is where many of the redcaps who serve Malabog live, striking at us from their thorned homes. I need you to collect Vibrant Seedlings from Pelendethas Everstride there. Bring me three such seedlings so we can plant them here. 
Pushing Back the Blight^60^Emrae Firesky^Sharandar^Emrae Firesky^Sharandar^The Blighted Grove^^Plant 4 Enchanted Saplings in blighted soil patches to drive back the blight in the Deep Blight area of Blighted Grove in Sharandar.^The injury to our forests inflicted by the dark fey blight will not heal by itself. We must re-seed. With Corellon's blessings, my priests and I have infused these seeds with verdant energy. Plant them in the blighted woods, and they will grow and undo some of the damage that has been done.
Blighted Beasts^70^Alihan Duskflight^Sharandar^Alihan Duskflight^Sharandar^The Blighted Grove^^Kill 6 Spiders in the Twisted Thicket area of Blighted Grove in Sharandar.^The redcaps guard their thicket gomes with dangerous fey beasts, and we must constantly fight to ensure that these fey beast guardians do not grow too plentiful. Find some of these fey beasts in the thickets where the redcaps dwell and slay them. I suppose that it may seem cruel to you, but it is what must be done if we are to defeat the dark fey.
By The Roots^60^Alihan Duskflight^Sharandar^Alihan Duskflight^Sharandar^The Blighted Grove^^Heal 3 Blighted Wildlife and gather 6 Blighted Acorns in The Plateau area of Blighted Grove in Sharandar.^Malabog and the dark fey pervert all that they touch. They are using a blight to turn our beautiful forests into warped mockeries as ugly and evil as they. Use this salve on any afflicted wildlife you find. It will help stave off the blight. Unfortunately, it will not work on afflicted trees or their acorns. The blighted acorns must be collected and destroyed before they spread the dark fey's accursed malady.
Redcap Bounty^60^Pelendethas Everstride^Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^Sharandar^The Blighted Grove^^Collect 20 Bloodstained Caps from Redcaps in the Blighted Grove in Sharandar.^The blighted forests are infested with redcaps that serve Malabog and his fomorian kin. They must be slain without mercy. Retrive the bloodsoaked caps from redcaps that you kill and return them to me. I will award you a bounty in recompense for your assistance.
Seeds from Cinders^56^Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^^^Collect Seeds from Burned Trees in the Charred Woods^When Mount Hotenow erupted all of my sisters in the forest below were burned to ash. Yet all hope is not lost, for their seeds may still lie dormant beneath their charred boughs. Could you please sift through the ashes beneath the burned trees of the Charred Wood, and see if any of their seeds survived?
Hostile Takeover^42^Ranger Leokas^Pirates' Skyhold^Ranger Leokas^Pirates' Skyhold^None^The Scaled Menace^Slay 4 Greenscale Trapper.^This swamp's got all the annoyances you'd think it would have. Bugs, disease, rotting filth... oh, and lizardfolk. Yeah, there are tribes of lizardfolk here on the island's swamps. They're not happy about us being here, and they're trying to convince us to leave by setting up snares nearby to our camp. We've already lost a few people to those snares, and we can't let that go on. Go and take out a few of their trappers. Maybe that will "convince" them that we mean business.
The Scaled Menace^42^Ranger Leokas^Pirates' Skyhold^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^None^^Gather 10 Lizardfolk Teeth from Blackscale Bruiser, Greenscale Trapper, and Greenscale Mystic.^Well, I guess there's one thing we have in common with the lizardfolk. Neither of us are giving in without a fight. They've stopped setting down so many snares near the camp, but they're packed in as thick as ever further on in the deep swamps. Head out there and clear a bunch of them out, then bring back the teeth to our forward scout, Tragold. We can string 'em up to serve as a warning. If these lizards want a fight, they'll get a fight.
Search and Seizure^43^Lili Huntinghawk^Pirates' Skyhold^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Ahead to Skull Fortress^Beneath Skull Fortress, Breaking the Blackscales^Ransack 5 Lizardfolk Hovels in the Sinking Town.^Hey! You can probably help me out here. We need someone to search the hovels the lizardfolk have set up in case they've collected anything useful. I know it's not very nice to ransack their houses, but, well, Thoros wants to kill them anyway. So, you know, at least it's not the worst thing we'll be doing to them, right? We also sent a scout out a little while ago to take a look around, but we haven't heard back from him. Oh, I'm sure he's fine, but can you try and find him? His name is Shaben Shortcloak.
Brain Damage^19^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Into The Unknown^The Birthing Pools, Unwilling Hosts^Destroy Brain Canisters in the Illithid Laboratory.^Listen carefully, surface crawler, I don't have time to waste. I tried to warn my people not to trust the Illithids, but the mind flayers came to silence me. Now I suffer a fate worse than death! Before I die I will have my revenge on those tentacled vermin! You wish to know their schemes? I will tell you, but you must first enact my vengeance. The mind flayers preserve the brains of their most illustrious ancestors - some foolish notion that they can join with a master brain and live forever. The brains are stored in special canisters to preserve them. I want you to destroy those canisters. Destroy their revered ancestors!
Unwilling Hosts^19^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Brain Damage^Illithid Enclave^Kill Mind Flayer Hosts.^The mind flayers reproduce by means of larva implanted in the skull of a suitable host. The larva devours the brain and mutates the body until it becomes a hideous mind flayer. Nearby are victims implanted with larva, their brains are being fed upon by those parasites. You must destroy then before they are reborn as mind flayers. Do not allow your foolish surface-dweller sentiments to stay your hand! These victims are already dead, although their flesh lives on. Killing them will be what your kind calls mercy.
Extra Awful^59^Hollie Tinkerstone^Whispering Caverns^Hollie Tinkerstone^Whispering Caverns^The Upper Vault^^Kill a Thoon Hulk in the Upper Vault.^Brrr! Those mind flayers give me a serious case of the creeps. They're like someone walking around with an octopus on their head - an octopus that wants to eat your brain! And the regular kind are nothing compared to the extra awful sort they call Thoon Hulks. Those creatures make the regular mind flayers seem darn right cuddly! Aside from being hard on the eyes, I'm pretty sure I don't want to face a Thoon Hulk in a fight either. You're the hired muscle here, why don't get rid of some of a Thoon Hulk for us?
A Dish Best Served Cold^59^Mad Brock^Whispering Caverns^Mad Brock^Whispering Caverns^The Upper Vault^^Kill Mind Flayers in the Upper Vault and collect their Brains.^Hey! You ain't no Flayer! Good! Good! You must be an adventurer. I was one too. Had a whole party of friends to adventure with, 'til we was caught by them Mind Flayers. They locked us up in a dungeon, an' every couple of days one would come and eat the brain of one of me friends! Eat'em right up! 'Til there twern't no one left but me. But I escaped, I did! Now I want me revenge! Make like an adventurer and fetch me the brains of them mind flayers, one fer every member of my old party!
The Birthing Pools^19^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Brain Damage^Illithid Enclave^Collect Wruz's Poison from his gear and add it to a Mind Flayer Birthing Pool.^The mind flayers bring forth their larva in specially prepared birthing pools. These pools teem with thousands of the vermin. The future of this vile race swims helpless in those pools. When I was brought here they stripped away my possessions. With luck you can still find them lying not far from here. A hidden pocket in my belt pouch holds a vial of extremely powerful poison. Find the vial and introduce its contents to one of the birthing pools. The poison will kill thousands of nascent mind flayers at a stroke. Kill the foul things. Destroy them all!
The Underscar^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^long quest chain^^Enter the Underscar and slay the Shepard of the Damned.^I've learned that the Ashmadai are driving the most wretched of the sick out of the Underscar, a warren of collapsed sewers where those without hope struggle for survival. Even now, they slaughter the sick and helpless beneath our very feet, led by the diabolic figure know as the Shepard of the Damned. Slay this monster, and protect the weakest among us from the cruelty of the Ashmadai! Once you're done, I want you to meet with a ranger at the edge of the wood.  His name is Dassar Truebow, and he has information about cult activity in the foresets.
Artifact Recovery^21^Elder Reader Laris^Protector's Enclave^Elder Reader Laris^Protector's Enclave^Artifact Facts^^Enter the Cragmire Vault and recover the Sealed Casket hidden within.^Through painstaking study I have discovered where a cache of valuable artifacts was hidden long ago. According to my sources, they can be found deep within the Cragmire Barrows, among the Blackdagger Ruins. Recovering these artifacts will be no trivial matter. Their former owner was an accomplished wizard and he is certain to have prepared a secure resting place for his prized possessions. You can expect formidable guardians as well. Lastly, the artifacts are sealed within a magically sealed casket. The defenders of Neverwinter are in need of artifacts like these. If you recover the casket, I can open it. Do this, and one of the artifacts within will be yours to keep.
Refining Enchantments^15^Bradda the Sage^Protector's Enclave^"Bradda the Sage^"Protector's Enclave^How Enchanting^^Refine the Enchantment in the ring Bradda has given you.^By refining and upgrading an enchantment, runestone or artifact you can make it more powerful. I'm going to give you a ring containing an enchantment, along with some additional enchantments. You can use the extras to upgrade the first one. In addition, I am giving you a reagent to upgrade the item once the refining is done. Go ahead, give it a try.
Lost Notes^26^Retrigal Bookbinder^Neverdeath Graveyard^Retrigal Bookbinder^Neverdeath Graveyard^^Smash the Hulks^Find Retrigal's Lost Notes, likely in the hands of the undead.^Oh, are you the help I was promised? It's terrible. I was going through the records of the dead in an effort to ratify Lord Neverember's inherited claim on the city when the dead started to rise! I was so frightened I left my notes in the graveyard. I'm sure some zombie or skeleton has them now. Could you retrieve them for me?
Blessing the Bones^36^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^^^Say a prayer for the dead over Villager's Bone Piles.^You have already done much for the dead of Grimhollow, and I know you have important matters to attend to, but it would mean a great deal to us if you said a small prayer over our bones. When the prayers have been said tell the Doomguide what you have done. I know he will be glad to hear of it.
The Haunting of Ebon Downs^8^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Melwil Stouthart^Ebon Downs^Missives, Auctions, and Diamonds^The Ghost of Grimhollow^Meet with Melwil Stouthart in Ebon Downs and learn what happened to Doomguide Soulhearth.^I sent the Doomguide Jasper Soulhearth and a contingent of guards south to the Ebon Downs. Their mission was to stop the Netherese necromancer, Idris, from raising an undead army. Neither Soulhearth, nor any of the guards, has returned. I need you to travel to the Ebon Downs and find out what happened. Once you reach the Downs, meet with the tavern owner Melwil Stouthart. He's an old friend and can likely tell you more.
Company of Wolves^5^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Five Keys to Success^Ancient Heritage, Hungry Like the Wolves, The Dark Hunter^Meet with Thalos Oathbreaker at the Forsworn Camp in Vellosk^A Forsworn member of the Gray Wolf Tribe has asked for help in reclaiming the honor of his people. It would certainly benefit Neverwinter to gain the goodwill of at least some of the Uthgardt barbarians. Speak with Thalos Oathbreaker at the Forsworn Camp in Vellosk. But be warned, that area is under the control of the Netherese. Their war with the Thayans means Valindra could be involved, and I've heard rumor that the Thayans are up to something there.
Back Up From Ebon Downs^11^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^The Throne of Idris^A New Path^Return to Protector's Enclave and report what happened to Sergeant Knox.^With Idris destroyed, you have done a great deed for Ebon Downs. You should head back to Neverwinter and tell Sergeant Knox what has happened here. I'm certain he'll want to know more, and I think there are far greater adventures ahead of you, my friend.
The Drowned King^9^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^The Dread Horde, The Barrow Lords^The Throne of Idris^Defeat the Drowned King and destroy the Deathknell Shards he guards.^Idris is almost vulnerable, but there are three final Shards still sealing the way. They are protected by the Drowned King, the most powerful of all the Barrow Lords. Defeating him and destroying the shards won't be easy, but it is the only way to reach Idris' fortress.
The Soul Slavers^9^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^The Dread Horde, The Barrow Lords^The Throne of Idris^Save Ghosts from Soul Slavers.^Idris is attempting to use something called the Direhelm Forge to creat an army of undead spirits under her control. This forge seems to be fueled by the souls of the departed. Idris has sent shadar-kai Soul Slavers to capture the ghosts of innocents buried in the Downs. We must stop this evil, for the sake of those poor departed souls and to disrupt the creation of more Direhelm soldiers.
The Dark Hunter^5^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Thalos Oathbreaker^Vellosk^Company of Wolves^Sacred Meeting^Destroy Shadow Totems in the Cursed Grove on the east end of Hunter's Path.^They Gray Wolf who follow the Netherese have began to worship aspects of their dark gods in the guise of Uthgar. The Dark Hunter is nothing more than an aspect of Shar the Night Mistress, who hunts in the shadows and kills without mercy. Worship of the Dark Hunter is an afront to Uthgar the Battle Father! Travel the road west and north of the Forsworn Camp, then turn right at the crossroads. At the east end of Hunter's Path you will find the Cursed Grove. Destroy any Shadow Totems you find there!
Every Last Drop^42^Irrae^Pirates' Skyhold^Irrae^Pirates' Skyhold^^Network Repair^Collect 5 Distilled Water in Mire's Edge.^It's strange... even the most foetid swamps usually have some places to find drinkable water. Not here, though. No matter where we look, the water is horribly poisonous. The lizardfolk have figured out how to distill drinkable water out of the swamp water. I've seen their stills out near the mire to the east. We won't last long without fresh water, so go swipe some from the lizards. With any luck, we can use it to figure out their purification technique.
Into The Unknown^19^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Thrall Keepers, Resonance Stones^Brain Damage^Investigate the Illithid Laboratories.^You've done well, <name>. but the time has come for you to push forward into areas where no Guide has yet ventured. The mind flayers have gathered here to open this long-sealed vault. We must make every effort to put a stop to whatever their plans are for what they find here. Travel deeper into the vault and see what you can discover. Take any opportunity you find to thwart the mind flayers' schemes. May luck go with you.
Playing the Double Cross^22^Mysterious Drow^Blackdagger Ruins^Mysterious Drow^Blackdagger Ruins^The Trap Closes^Intervention Interrupted^Destroy the Weapon Shipment Crates that Xorlarrin have given to the Blackdagger bandits.^I've discovered another House Xorlarrin spy here, working with the Blackdagger bandits. Likely to supply the Blackdaggers with Xorlarrin magical weapon and support. This spy has already negotiated a deal with the Blackdaggers. So, now our job isn't to prevent the deal from happening, but to interfere with it and smoke out the Xorlarrin spy. The Weapons shipments are being offloaded into Blackdagger hands down by the shore. Go destroy them and make a big scene. Surface dwellers can't tell the difference between one drow and another, so with any luck the Blackdagger will that Xorlarrin have double-crossed them.
Intervention Interrupted^24^Mysterious Drow^Blackdagger Ruins^Mysterious Drow^Blackdagger Ruins^Playing the Double Cross^No Time for Subtlety^Kill the Xorlarrin Spy and Blackdagger Bandits who are meeting in the abandoned mineshaft.^With the Blackdagger bandits thinking that House Xorlarrin has double-crossed them, the Xorlarrin spy is scrambling to patch up relations, calling an emergency meeting with her Blackdagger contacts. She likely knows she's being predictable and leaving herself open to danger, but returning to Menzoberranzan having failed her mission is almost certain death. The meeting is taking place very soon in one of the abandoned mineshafts to the northwest. Find the Xorlarrin spy there and kill her, along with her Blackdagger Contacts. When you're done, I'll meet you outside of the valley with all the mines. Keep an eye out for me. 
No Time for Subtlety^54^Mysterious Drow^Rothé Valley^Mysterious Drow^Rothé Valley^Intervention Interrupted^Plots Within Plots^Collect 5 Xorlarrin Orders off of Deathweavers in Rothé Valley.^House Xorlarrin never shows its true hand so forwardly. I am certain this straightforward assault on Rothé Valley hides other, more subtle motives under its more plain ones. I have even obtained information suggesting that the Xorlarrin plan to retreat from this area soon. The retreat seems a little too eager to me. I suspect House Xorlarrin is very close to completing some alternate, less obvious objective. They may have already completed it. This leaves us only a small window to figure out what that objective is. Their Deathweavers often carry coded orders. Bring the orders here and I'll decode them.
Plots Within Plots^54^Mysterious Drow^Rothé Valley^Mysterious Drow^Rothé Valley^No Time for Subtlety^Bloodlines^Retrieve the Slavemaster Orders from Xorlarrin Slavemaster in Rothé Valley.^Very strange. Apparently a group of enslaved villagers from northern Rothé Valley were brought here for some kind of examination. At least one has been transferred out of the valley elsewhere, perhaps into the Underdark. The orders speak of this alongside their plans for retreat out of the valley. These prisoners may hold a clue as to House Xorlarrin's true motives. They are currently being held in a farmhouse to the southwest. Rescue them and retrieve any orders you find on the corpse of their Slavemaster.
Bloodlines^59^Bregan D'aerthe Operative^Whispering Caverns^Bregan D'aerthe Operative^Whispering Caverns^Plots Within Plots^^Free the Dwarf of Delzoun Blood from House Xorlarrin imprisonment in the Whispering Caverns.^It took me some time to decipher the coded Xorlarrin orders you brought me in Rothé Valley, but it has paid off. Apparently, House Xorlarrin seeks access to the fabled dwarven city of Gauntlgrym. It must contain contain something of great power that the Xorlarrin desire. Gauntlgrym is protected by a huge set of mithral doors, which will only open to the touch of a dwarf of Delzoun heritage. Which is what the Xorlarrin captured in Rothé Valley! The captive is being held in Zesraena by a wizard named Gelafein. I will misdirect their attention. You slip in and retrieve the dwarf.
Artifact Facts^21^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Elder Reader Laris^Protector's Enclave^^Artifact Recovery^Seek out Elder Reader Laris at the Sage Shop in Protector's Enclave to learn about Magical Artifacts.^Listen, <name>, I have a friend among the priests of Oghma who has been filling me in on some very old and powerful magic items... artifacts he calls them. Seems he's learned the resting place of some of these artifacts and he's afraid that other, less desirable, researchers may learn the same. Personally, I'd rather have someone like you holding a powerful item rather than some Red Wizard or Dragon Cultist. Go talk to Elder Reader Laris at the Sage Shop here in Protector's Enclave. He'll be expecting you.
Blackdagger's End^25^Garl Gnarlclaw^Blackdagger Ruins^^Blackdagger Ruins^Grimstorm Keep^^Enter Cragmire Crypts to defeat the necromancer Kallos Tam and destroy the pirate lord Traven Blackdagger.^Xalliana discovered a darker force controlling the Blackdagger Bandits from the Crypts deep beneath Blackdagger Ruins. She went to hunt down the two powers in charge: A wizard named Kallos Tam, and the powerful pirate lord Traven Blackdagger. She hasn't returned, and I fear the worst. The Harpers will pay well for you to investigate, and to finish her mission if she has fallen.
Hot on the Trail^6^Private Hawthidon^Blacklake District^Zoey Fargo^Blacklake District^The Dead Rats^Close to the Crown^Meet with Zoey Fargo near the Nasher safehouse in the Tatters.^Accodring to Gothwan's information, Karzov is hiding in a safe house nearby, while the Crown is hidden in their headquarters. Meet with Private Zoey Fargo. She's keeping watch over the safe house where Karzov is hiding.
Smash the Hulks^26^Retrigal Bookbinder^Neverdeath Graveyard^Retrigal Bookbinder^Neverdeath Graveyard^Lost Notes^Clear the Crypt^Find and destroy 3 Zombie Hulks in Neverdeath.^With my notes in order, I'm planning to finish my task here in Neverdeath. The undead are horrible, but most cannot overcome a decent barricade. Of course that does not apply so well to the Zombie Hulks. If I'm going to be holed up in a tomb, I need to be sure that one of those monsters doesn't smash through and crush me! I would really feel much safer if you could kill them. Just the really big ones... You undersand.
Clear the Crypt^26^Retrigal Bookbinder^Neverdeath Graveyard^Retrigal Bookbinder^Neverdeath Graveyard^Smash the Hulks^^Defeat the newly Risen Guardian of the Crypt of Vars Never.^You've been an invaluable help. I think I will be able to finish my research here. You see, I believe I may have found the tomb of Vars Never! He's the ancestor of our Lord Protector. The tomb should be empty, of course, if Vars did settle in Waterdeep. But anything that I find in there should prove most interesting. Especially if records of his lineage were inscribed anywhere! The tomb is not far, but I would be grateful if you could clear it of any lingering dead.
Dungeon Delving^19^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Dungeon Chest Keymaster^Protector's Enclave^^^Learn about Dungeons and Dungeon Chests from Armario Clavus in Protector's Enclave.^Before I signed on with Lord Neverember I did a bit of adventuring myself. There was nothing like the thrill of destroying a dire threat at the bottom of a dark dungeon and claiming some nice loot. But if you want some real dungeon delving advice you should speak to Armario Clavus down in the marketplace. You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Armario was a legendary dungeon explorer in his day. After he retired he became a master locksmith. His specialty is crafting keys capable of unlocking magically sealed dungeon chests. Maybe you should have a talk with him before you find yourself exploring a dungeon.
Underdark Harvest^17^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Into the Underdark^Prisoners of the Drow^Gather Bitter Berries from plants in the Verdant Caves.^The whole camp is working together to prepare for freeing our captured Guides. I believe our ranger Megan Arrowroot needs the aid of an adventurer able to stand up to the drow. She is trying to gather some particular kind of berry from the Verdant Caves. You should speak with her.
Hunters in the Dark^17^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Into the Underdark^Prisoners of the Drow^Collect Cell Keys from Drow Huntresses and Driders in the Verdant Caves.^The area called Verdant Caves is like an oasis in the midst of a desert for those who venture into the Underdark. Waves of Wizard Fire found here provide enough light to sustain lush plant growth. That's why we chose this area for our base of operations, despite the presence of an abandoned drow settlement nearby. Unfortunately the drow have returned and captured some of our scouts. We're working on a plan to save our imprisoned comrades. If you can find keys to the holding cells on the drow hunting in the area, we'll have a real shot at saving my people.
Long Overdue^59^Wendolyn Shoosh^Whispering Caverns^Wendolyn Shoosh^Whispering Caverns^^^Searh the rubbish heaps of Zesraena for a missing Candlekeep Library Book.^Oh, hello. I'm Wendolyn Shoosh of the Candlekeep Order of Librarians Militant. Perhaps you've heard of us? No? It's our duty to recover books that go missing from the Candlekeep's collection. For years I've been on the hunt for a certain scholarly work. I discovered the tome was taken into the Underdark by a would-be explorer. Painstaking research leads me to believe the fellow met his end in Zesraena. I intended to search the rubbish heaps of Zesraena for our book, but I'm not as young as I was when we started this quest. Maybe you could do the searching for me?
Foul Fungus^59^Una Soverson^Whispering Caverns^Una Soverson^Whispering Caverns^Vile Venom^^Gather Skullcap Mushrooms from the Drow settlement of Zesraena.^Those spider venom samples you brought me were a good beginning, but in the Underdark you can find toxins in the flora as well as the fauna. In particular, there are several varieties of poisonous fungus to be found. The Drow are quite fond of a poison brewed from the Skullcap Mushroom. I would dearly love to have some samples of these mushrooms, but it will mean venturing into the drow settlement of Zesraena. The Drow encourage the growth of skullcaps, so there should be plenty of them growing in the town.
Prisoners of the Drow^17^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Underdark Harvest, Hunters in the Dark^Xorlarrin Outpost^Free Prisoners being held in the slave pits of Zesraena.^When the drow attacked, we were camped in the abandoned settlement of Zesraena. They weren't happy that we were staying in their old city. Several of us managed to escape thanks to the quick thinking of our leader Mandrake Deepwise, but others - including Mandrake - are still unaccounted for. I have to believe that they're still alive in the drow slave pits. Now that preparations are complete, it's time to push back the drow and free our people! I'm counting on you, adventurer. We need to mind Mandrake, and save everyone we can.
A Chill Wind^70^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Captain Dunmish^Protector's Enclave^^Icewind Dale^Meet with Captain Dunmish in Protector's Enclave about travelling to Icewind Dale.^A sea captain arrived in Protector's Enclave the other day, telling of strange events happening in Icewind Dale, far to the north. Dunmish was his name. According to the Captain, a recent calamity has left the region covered in a strange substance the locals call 'black ice'. Some say this black ice is a wondrous material capable of making incredible weapons and armor. Others say it is a curse on the land, corrupting the minds and hearts of every living thing it touches. Captain Dunmish is offering passage to heroes willing to brave the dangers of Icewind Dale. He's only taking the very best, though. Do you think you'll meet his standards?
Into the Underdark^17^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Artifacts and Insignias^Underdark Harvest, Hunters in the Dark^Meet with the Underdark Guide Davlin Hoth in the Northdark.^Have you heard of the Guild of Underdark Guides, <name>? They're a group that specializes in leading expeditions into the sprawling underground realm known as the Underdark. Word is they have put out the call for adventurers to help them in the area they call the Northdark. Sounds right up your alley, doesn't it? You might want to check it out. The call came from a guide named Davlin Hoth. He's the man you should look for.
Xorlarrin Outpost^17^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Prisoners of the Drow^Delving Deeper^Enter the Xorlarrin Outpost and rescue Mandrake Deepwise.^I'd hoped Mandrake Deepwise would be among the prisoners you rescued. Mandrake is something of a legend among the Guild. Normally, I'd say its a shame to lose another guide and get over it. But Mandrake... he doesn't get taken without a fight. The drow must know his value. If I were them, I'd take him for interrogation. Invade the Xorlarrin Outpost, kill any drow that stand in your way, and bring Mandrake Deepwise back to us.
Delving Deeper^18^Davlin Hoth^Whispering Caverns^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^Xorlarrin Outpost^The Payoff, A Winch In Their Plans^Meet with the Underdark Guilde Jasper Steele who is investigating the Duergar-Drow alliance.^The presence of an Illithid - a Mind Flayer - in a Drow settlement bodes no good for anyone. We already know the drow are receiving weapons from the Duergar who work the nearby mines. Normally the drow do not see the Duergar as fit for anything but slavery, but I begin to suspect the grey dwarves are already enslaved to an even more deadly foe. We have Guides keeping watch over the Duergar mines. Make your way there and look for Jasper Steele. He'll fill you in on anything he's learned.
A Winch In Their Plans^18^Malm Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Malm Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Delving Deeper^The Overseers, Quality Work^Destroy Winch Mechanisms to disable duergar mining cranes.^The duergar minin' and forgin' operations are going full tilt. That's a bad news for the Guild and the surface world. The raw ore is comin' from deep shafts down below and the duergar 'ave built a batch of cranes to help 'em lift it to these levels. Without those cranes the ore will have to be hauled up on the back of the miners. It'll mean a big hit to their efficiency. All you really 'ave to do is destroy the winching mechanism that operates a crane and you'll send the whole thing crashing to the bottom of the pit!
Labor Relations^59^Grunn Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Grunn Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Delving Deeper^Master Smiths^Kill 20 Duergar in the Steelshear Mines and the Crucible.^Damn these duergar! They'll swing their hammers for any Underdark dwellin' tyrant that comes along! Folks call 'em Grey Dwarves, but that's as an insult to Moradin fearin' dwarves elsewhere! We'd all be better off if these devil spawn were exterminated! Now my brother - the big soft lout - has all kinds of ideas 'bout how to slow down the duergar operation but I favor the direct approach. After all, it's tough for them to do any work when they're dead! Do us all a favor and kill a pack of the duergar workin' the Steelshear Mines and the Crucible.
The Payoff^18^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^Delving Deeper^The Overseers, Quality Work^Kill drow and duergar overseeing the weapon exchange in the Duergar Mines.^The drow are receiving duergar made weapons in exchange for guarding the entrance to the mines. Seems like House Xorlarrin is trying to rebuild its strength after their failed attack on the surface world. Duergar weapons and armor will go a long way toward accomplishing that goal. The drow have sent some of their high-ranking priestesses to handle the details of the payment and oversee the transfer. I'd like you to bust up these meetings and make sure the participants don't live to tell the tale.
Quality Work^59^Malm Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Malm Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^The Payoff, A Winch In Their Plans^Wrathforge^Collect Duergar Smithing Supplies from duergar and their work sites.^My sister has a real unflinchin' hatred of the duergar. But I have to admit they still have the dwarven knack for working metal. That's why the drow have made a deal with 'em. They want the quality weapons and armor the grey dwarves can provide. I think those weapons would be better off going to the Guild. If you gather up some of the weapon components the duergar are turnin' out, I'll see that you're rewarded for it. You'll like find the components near forges in the Crucible and some of the duergar are sure to be carryin' them as well.
Powerful Alloys^59^Malm Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Malm Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^A Winch In Their Plans^^Collect 10 Duergar Alloy Samples from duergar and their work sites in the Crucible.^This part of the Underdark is well know for its deposits of magical ores. The presence of those ores are what brought the duergar to the Whispering Caverns in the first place. From what I've seen so far they've created some really strong and useful alloys from them. In fact, I'd like a chance to get a better look at few of those alloys. While you're in the Crucible why not try to snatch up any alloy samples you can. I'd be might pleased if you did.
Master Smiths^59^Grunn Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Grunn Axbridge^Whispering Caverns^Labor Relations^^Kill 3 Master Smiths in the Crucible.^The duergar make pretty fair weapons an' armor for a pack of degenerates. I think most of 'em barely know what end of a hammer to hang on to, but they do have a few master smiths among 'em that know a thing or two about metal work. If you were to take down those smiths it'd be sure to lower the quality of duergar work across the board. What'aya say? Wanna hammer flat a few smiths?
A Hell of a Read^59^Antor Bren^Whispering Caverns^Antor Bren^Whispering Caverns^Into the Underdark^^Kill Duergar Theurges and recover the Scroll of Vile Summoning.^Greetings, brave one. I am on a sacred mission to rid the world of diabolical artifacts, a quest that has led me to seek the Scroll of Vile Summoning. The rituals on that scroll can summon powerful devils from the Nine Hells. It must be destroyed! But alas, my unfortunate diabolical heritage betrays me. As I get closer to the scroll I feel a growing to claim it for my own. I know the evil thing is in the hands of one of the duergar Theurges that inhabit these mines. Will you seize the scroll in my place?
Wrathforge^18^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^The Overseers, Quality Work^The Upper Vault^Enter the Wrathforge and defeat the Forge Master.^According to the duergar we've interrogated, the mind flayer leading this illithid is known as Revered Thlorrog. He's hunting for an Upper Vault, where the flayers think there's a lost god. Few of our prisoners know anything about the Upper Vaults. Apparently only one duergar has been there and returned: the Forge Master of the Wrathforge. He's a master smith and overseer that the flayers either trust or control completely. The Guild would like you to enter the Wrathforge and get the secret of the Upper Vault from the Forge Master. Are you up to the task?
The Upper Vault^19^Jasper Steele^Whispering Caverns^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^Wrathforge^Thrall Keepers, Resonance Stones^Pass through the portal and find the Underdark Guide Soren Ravaris.^The Forge Master spoke of the "Iron Heart"? I have a feeling I know what that is all about. There seems to be some sort of portal in the Crucible. Our guild wizard, Soren Ravaris, and a few companions are investigating it as we speak. My guess is the portal leads to the Upper Vault. If Soren has found a way through, then it might be open to you as well. The portal lies just beyond the bridge that spans the Crucible, make your way through it, find Soren and see what he's learned.
Thrall Keepers^19^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^The Upper Vault^Into The Unknown^Kill Mind Flayer Masterminds and Scourges in the Upper Vault.^We are investigating the illithid activity here, but have not gone far because of the many perils we found in our path. One thing is clear: the mind flayes have come here for a nefarious reason and I very much doubt it will benefit us to allow that mission to succeed. We've seen that these creatures can control others with the power of their minds. Their so-called Masterminds must be the key to their plot. If you can defeat a few, and their guards, perhpas we can draw out the true threat, or at least disrupt their plans.
Resonance Stones^19^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^The Upper Vault^Into The Unknown^Use Soren's Mind Blank Scroll against Resonance Stones in the Illithid Sept.^It is apparent the Illithids rely much more on psionics - the power of the mind - than on magic. In our exploration, we encountered strange Illithid made stones that affected our emotional state. We felt fear, pain and overwhelming despair in their presence. We need to find some defense against the power of these stones. I've inscribed several Mind Blank spells upon this scroll. Although the spell is intended to prevent others from reading your mind, I suspect it may also have the power to neutralize the resonance stones. Please locate the stones and disable them so that we can continue our investigation.
Vile Venom^59^Una Soverson^Whispering Caverns^Una Soverson^Whispering Caverns^Into the Underdark^Foul Fungus^Collect Venom Samples from the spiders in the Verdant Caves to aid in the creation of antidotes.^I joined the Guild as a means to pursue my study of the flora and fauna of the Underdark. Not many sages are willing to risk the perils of the underground realms, but I find it invigorating. I'm currently studying the various natural toxins found in this region. With a little study I should be able to formulate antidos for most of them. Of course, the hard part is collecting samples. It would really help me out if you could gather some venom samples from the spiders that infest the Verdant Caves.
Illithid Enclave^19^Wruz Olg'lmar^Whispering Caverns^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^The Birthing Pools, Unwilling Hosts^Back to the Surface^Enter the Illithid Enclave and slay Revered Thlorrog.^I don't have much longer. Words are... becoming difficult. The mind flayer you seek... Revered Thlorrog... whom we all must serve... No! It hides in the Illithid Enclave, searching for an ancient Elder Brain. Destroy him... and bring ruin to all these abominations. You must stop Thlorrog from reaching the Elder Brain...
Back to the Surface^20^Soren Ravaris^Whispering Caverns^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Illithid Enclave^The Loose Thread^Meet with Sergeant Knox in Protector's Enclave.^Your success here in Whispering Caverns has saved us from the illithid threat. Excellent work, adventurer. The Guild will soon move to explore the wonders of the Underdark now that you've made it safer. I do have to wonder though, how the drow, duergar, and illithid were all working together towards some nefarious end. I can't help but think that someone or something is still working in the shadows. Nevertheless, I'm sure you're eager to return to the surface and report what happened here to Neverwinter. Savor the fresh air when you get there and good luck on your travels.
Gruumsh Rising^59^Uloth^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^^^^Deal with the Cult of Gruumsh in the Enclave Sewers beneath Protector's Enclave.^That is a shame. If you still side with those who wish to rebuild, then that makes us enemies. But I can accept that, for you possess great strength within you, and the ability and ambition to shape your fate and the fate of those around you. You will test our worthiness. To arms, my brothers! Today we have the honor to be tested in battle by one of the strongest of our blood in Neverwinter!
The Protector's Speech^6-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Help protect the city during Lord Neverember's yearly address to the people of Neverwinter by completing the Skirmish, The Protector's Speech.^Every year Lord Neverember takes it upon himself to deliver an address to the people of the city, and every year unsavory elements take it upon themselves to cause a ruckus while the city guard is occupied protecting the Protector. It seems this year will be no different. Lord Neverember will be well guarded, but the city could use the help of heroes like yourself. 
The Flames of War^57^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^^^Slay Fire Archons to weaken Gommoth's army.^Our work in these ruins has been greatly impeded by the actions of General Ignazar and his army of Fire Archons. The ruins serve as the battlements of a fortress, from which they send forces to attack any who oppose Gommoth's plan to release their ancient master. Because of this, I must ask for your aid in reducing the number of Fire Archons in this area.
Peril on Icespire Peak^11^Sergeant Knox  ^Protector's Enclave^Bolbin Ironbrow  ^Icespire Peak^A New Path^Prisoners of War^Travel to Icespire Peak and help the Icehammer Dwarves to retake their territory.^If you would credit it, I've heard the Icehammer Dwarves have dredged up some ancient evil on Icespire Peak. I don't know details, but it must be pretty serious because they've even been calling for outside assistance to help them deal with it. Neverwinter has profited in the past few years from Icehammer mithral flowing through the port. Since their recent troubles, the mithral has dried up. It might be worth your while to go talk to them.
Vartilingorix^35^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Barrow Busters^^Defeat Vartilingorix.^A vicious black dragon named Vartilingorix frequents these swamps. I fear he may have agreed to work with the Cult in Ebon Downs. The dragon must be defeated if we are to prevent the Cult from achieving their goals here.
Merothrax^46^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Missing Mithral^^Defeat Merothrax.^The Cult has enlisted the aid of Merothrax, a white dragon as greedy as he is stupid. Don't take him lightly, what he lacks in brains, he makes up for in brawn. If the Lords' Alliance is to retake that mine, Merothrax needs to be put down.
Venfithar^52^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Free Passage^^Defeat Venfithar^A blue dragon named Venfithar is working with the Cult here. As near as I can tell the Cultists are storing the lightning breathed by the dragon in those fancy jars. What they need with all that lightning is beyond me. We should try to ground that blue dragon.
Vilithrax^60^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^An Unlikely Alliance^^Defeat Vilithrax^The Cultists have summoned a dracolich to guard that area they've been digging up. They really don't want anyone else discovering what they learned here. Get rid of that dragon so my associates can conduct a thorough search of the area.
Cult Communications^28^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Cult in Crisis^Dead Men Do Tell Tales, Grave Swapping^Collect Documents from Defeated Cultists.^Scouting reports say that this new, "heretical" faction of the Cult of the Dragon is holed up at the back of Craftsman's Rest in an area known as "Merchant's Landing." Many of Neverwinter's most prominent merchants are buried there. Like their brethren, these new cultists appear to be looking for something. Reports also indicate both groups have been going at it tooth and nail, but the "new" cultists have repulsed all the attacks by the "old" cultists. A green dragon has been spotted circling the area and may be assisting the "new" cultists. As much as I hope the two groups wipe each other out, we need to know what is going on here in case this factional warfare spreads to other locations. Neither side is likely to tell you anything useful, so go see if you can recover any useful documents from the casualties up there.
Artifacts of Legend^60^Jarlaxel Baenre^Caer-Konig^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^^Vault of the Nine^Speak with Lord Neverember at the Hall of Justice in Protector's enclave about Jarlaxle's findings (found in Ice Wind Dale).^Yess, I think you are someone I can entrust with this quest... The drow of House Xorlarrin have longed to become the true power of Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. To this end they seek out powerful artifacts to give them the edge they need to destroy their enemies. Some of the Xorlarrin spies in Neverwinter have learned of a cache of powerful magical artifacts deep under the ruins of Castle Never. In their hands, it could prove disastrous to the good people of the Sword Coast. This cannot be allowed to happen. Speak with Lord Neverember in Protector's Enclave about my findings. We have been in communication. He'll know what to do next.
Cult on the Rise^26^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^^Cult in Crisis^Speak to Harper Boward in Protector's Enclave.^More trouble in Neverdeath. As if the dead rising and the Cult of the Dragon ransacking tombs wasn't bad enough, now it seems the Cult is fighting amongst themselves. Ordinarily that would be good news, but it seems the reason for the fighting is due to a change in leadership -- and the new leader, Severin, has big plans for the Cult. Harper Boward can give you more information. You can find her just west of here, on the other side of the Temple area. She is in conference with others who are also concerned about the Cult's change in tactics.
Cult in Crisis^27^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^^Cult Communications^Speak to Harper Windle in Neverdeath.^Harper Windle in Neverdeath has sent some very intriguing reports. Apparently the Cult of the Dragon members in the graveyard have started fighting each other! Windle has not been able to establish a reason for this sudden rift inside the Cult, but the Harpers are very interested in determining what has happened in that organization. Will you go to Neverdeath and assist Windle? She can update you when you arrive.
Marching Orders^52^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Missing Mithral^Freedom Pass, Bottled Lightning^Search the camp and defeated Cultists for  Cult documents.^Why is the Cult of the Dragon here? And in such numbers? What are those strange looking jars? The Emerald Enclave has heard disturbing rumors concerning the Cult's recent activities. I can't but think this incursion into Rothé is tied in with the other Cult sightings. Search the Cult's camp and any cultists you defeat for clues. We need to know why they are appearing so openly if we are going to combat them effectively.
Free Passage^70^Delrin Bass^Protector's Enclave^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Lords' Alliance Report: Cult of the Dragon^Marching Orders^Talk to Thar Greenbough in Rothé Valley^A situation concerning the Cult of the Dragon has arisen in Rothé Valley. This new sect within the Cult has closed off a mountain pass leading out of the valley. Rangers with the Emerald Enclave were using this pass to smuggle slaves rescued from the Drow out of the valley, but the Cult activity has stopped this and even seen some of slaves returned to captivity. Please go to Rothé Valley and aid the rangers there. Thar Greenbough can give you more information when you arrive.
Harpers' Report: Cult of the Dragon^26^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Grave Swapping, Dead Men Do Tell Tales^^Deliver Windle's report to Harper Boward^I think we're off to an excellent start, but given what we've leaned about the new direction Severin has taken the Cult of the Dragon, I'd say victory celebrations are a bit premature. I've prepared a report for Harper Boward in Protector's Enclave. Would you deliver it to her for me?
Grave Swapping^30^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Dead Men Do Tell Tales^Ghost Stories^Swap the Grave Markers^We still don't know what's so important about this portal the Cult is looking for, but I'd bet it's in out best interests they not find it. To accomplish that, we need to prevent them from finding Messandar's grave here in Neverdeath. The Cultists are chatting up any spirit that might know where he is buried. Messandar was well-respected in Neverwinter and his funeral was well-attended. It's only a matter of time until one of these ghosts gives up the goods. It it wasn't for the devastation the spell plague caused here, I'm sure they would have already found him. My contacts in Protector's Enclave have furnished me with a list of Messandar's closest associates who are now interred here. Take these fake plaques and swap them for the ones on his associates' graves. It may buy us the time we need to figure out a more permanent solution.
Dead Men Do Tell Tales^30^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Harper Windle^Neverdeath Graveyard^Cult in Crisis^Grave Swapping^Disrupt rituals and break summoning circles.^This new Cult seems desperate for information. They're looking for a barbarian named Cruven Gantara so they can find a portal to some island. They have no idea where Cruven is buried, so they are trying to speak with the spirit of one of his dead adventuring companions, Belast Messandar. They know Messandar is buried in Neverdeath, but don't know the exact location, so they are summoning up the spirits of any dead merchant who might have known him and quizzing them. Let's help the dead rest in peace and disrupt the Cult's summoning rituals.
Bottled Lightning^52^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Marching Orders^Emerald Enclave Report: Cult of the Dragon^Sabotage charged Lightning Jars^The documents you found make it pretty clear the lightning the Cult is storing in those jars is vital to their master plan -- whatever that may be. One thing I am sure of, though, anything that helps the Cult is going to be bad for the rest of us, unless you fancy being ruled over by dragons. How do you feel about popping the corks on some of those fancy bottles?
Barrow Demolition^60^Preceptor Theraclast^Protector's Enclave^Harper Windle^Protector's Enclave^Order of the Gauntlet Report: Cult of the Dragon^^Collapse the Burial Chambers^Despite the setbacks you caused the Cult on your last visit to Ebon Downs, they have continued digging and breached the magical wards on the barrow. Acolyte Heiron reports that captured cultists believe they are very close to finding the final resting place of the barbarian warlord. He also reports that the Cult has moved barrels of Dragon Fire Tar into the Barrow to aid in their excavations. That gives us an opportunity to slow them down. If you can enter the barrow and detonate the Dragon Fire Tar in the right places, it will slow the Cult down considerably.
Culling the Cultists^26^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Assisting the Harpers^^Kill 25 members of the Cult of the Dragon.^The Cult of the Dragon continues to gain new members despite the heavy losses inflicted on them by you. I suppose the lure of wealth and power is simply irresistible to some. The Cult's growing power poses a real threat to the stability and security of the Sword Coast. I think it may be time to take some drastic measures to make some of the newer members have second thoughts.
Ghost Stories^70^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harpers' Report: Cult of the Dragon^^Lay the Ancient Lorekeepers to rest^The Cult of the Dragon has expanded their search for Belast Messandar's grave. They have been looking in the Soldier's Memorial section of Neverdeath. I don't know whether that is due to a tip from a spirit or simply because Messandar was a veteran of numerous campaigns. Either way, we need to keep the Cult from speaking to Messandar and learning the location of Cruven's burial site. We need someone to disrupt the Cult's efforts and lay those spirits to rest. Will you do it?
Ancient Treasures^60^Shay Cutter^Protector's Enclave^Shay Cutter^Protector's Enclave^Zhentarim Report: Cult of the Dragon^The Portal to Tuern^Stop the Cult from plundering Saphirax's Hoard^Saphirax was rumored to have a hoard of ancient artifacts from empires thousands of years old. Thanin has found a way into the Duergar tunnels in his search for the dragon's trove. Zhentarim spies have informed me that the Duergar were fighting back, but I have lost contact with my contacts now. What Thanin plans to do with these treasures is anyone's guess, but we can't let them fall into the hands of the cult. Stop them from collapsing the Duergar tunnels -- the Duergar will slow them down -- and see if you can find the the Zhentarim agents. If you manage to rescue some artifacts, we should be able to find buyers for them, and so continue to fund our operations against the Cult of the Dragon. Most importantly, find Thanin and stop the cult from plundering the dragon's hoard.
Barrow Busters^35^Preceptor Theraclast^Protector's Enclave^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Harpers' Report: Cult of the Dragon^Rub them Wrong^Talk to Acolyte Heiron in Ebon Downs^The Order of the Gauntlet has dispatched a team to Ebon Downs to help contain the undead there. The leader of the team, Acolyte Heiron, has made a disturbing discovery. The Cult of the Dragon has appeared in Ebon Downs in large numbers. They appear to be trying to enter one of the oldest barrows in the area, but are stymied by some sort of magical ward. Our clerics have their hands full with undead, so the Order is requesting your help in investigating the Cult's activities. Please go to Ebon Downs and speak with Acolyte Heiron.
Rub them Wrong^35^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Barrow Busters^Order of the Gauntlet Report: Cult of the Dragon^Copy the inscriptions from 6 obelisks in the Valley of the Ancients.^The Cult of the Dragon have spent a lot of time unearthing obelisks throughout the Valley of the Ancients and studying the inscriptions on them. We need to know what information they are gathering. Go to the Valley of the Ancients and copy the inscriptions on the obelisks there.
Remnants of the Past^35^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Barrow Busters^Order of the Gauntlet Report: Cult of the Dragon^Collect 10 Scroll Fragments in the Valley of the Ancients.^The Cult of the Dragon has unearthed many ancient urns filled with scrolls. Most of the scrolls are little more than fragments, but they seem to be of some importance to the Cultists. We need to see what information is contained on those fragments. Slip into the Valley of the Ancients and collect some scroll fragments. You can find them in unearthed urns and on the Cultists themselves.
Order of the Gauntlet Report: Cult of the Dragon^35^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Preceptor Theraclast^Protector's Enclave^Remnants of the Past, Barrow Guardians^Missing Mithral^Deliver Heiron's report to Preceptor Theraclast.^It seems the Cult has narrowed down the location of the final resting place of the barbarian Cruven Gantara. Given the chaos you were able to create today, however, it may be some time before they find him. I've prepared a report of today's events for Preceptor Theraclast in Protector's Enclave. Would you take it to him?
Barrow Guardians^35^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Acolyte Heiron^Ebon Downs^Rub them Wrong^Order of the Gauntlet Report: Cult of the Dragon^Try to raise 4 groups of Barrow Guardians in the Valley of the Ancients.^The barrow in the Valley of the Ancients holds the remains of an ancient barbarian warrior and the Cult is very interested in speaking to his spirit. I'm not sure why, but it seems like a good idea to prevent this. The barrow has a powerful magic ward the Cult has been unable to breach, but it's only a matter of time. Let's make it more difficult for them. Those obelisks mark the burial place of guardians entombed as part of the barbarian's funeral. Read this incantation near an obelisk and it should raise the guardians to attack the tomb invaders. Some of the guardians may have been destroyed over the centuries, so don't be disappointed if it doesn't always work.
Forged in Fire^60^Delrin Bass^Protector's Enclave^Auto Completes^Rothé Valley^Emerald Enclave Report: Cult of the Dragon^^Disrupt the Cult of the Dragon Camp^The situation has deteriorated in Rothé  Valley. Despite the setbacks you caused them, the Cult has continued in their attempts to win favor with the Drow, and they seem to be working. Members of the Cult have been spotted going in and out of the main Drow slave camp. It appears they are using the slaves to replace the lightning jars you destroyed on your last visit. Return to Rothé Valley and ifiltrate that camp. We need to drive a wedge between the Cult and the Drow. Imbross Irri'karr will smuggle you into the camp.
Missing Mithral^46^Fitzhugh Montgomery^Protector's Enclave^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Order of the Gauntlet Report: Cult of the Dragon^A Miner Setback^Talk to Hazrah Stormhammer in Icespire Peak^I represent the Lords' Alliance. Lord Neverember, as you may know, is a member of that organization. Another member of our group is Florin Icehammer, the leader of a small clan of dwarves near Icespire Peak. The Icehammer dwarves, although small in number, are large in wealth -- specifically the mithral mines they operate. Their contributions to the Alliance have been both late and short the past few months and threaten their standing with the organization. Icehammer has offered no explanation for these shortfalls. I would like you to travel to Icespire Peak and speak to Hazrah Stormhammer, Icehammer's Master of Mines.
A Miner Setback^46^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Missing Mithral^Miner Settlement, Fix Their Wagon^Investigate the Mine Site^You there! I need your assistance. I am Hazrah Stormhammer, Florin Icehammer's Master of Mines, and I have a problem. The goblin attack has cut off production from one of our most productive mithral mines. As I'm sure you know, Lord Icehammer is a member of the Lords' Alliance. The reason such a small settlement as ours holds such a position of influence is the mithral in these mountains. If the mithral stops flowing, Icehammer's position in the Alliance becomes quite precarious. All the scouts I sent to the mine have failed to return. I need you to go to the mine and scout the situation. Who controls the mine? What is the condition of the miners? 
Fix Their Wagon^46^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^A Miner Setback^Lords' Alliance Report: Cult of the Dragon^Sabotage the Cultists' Wagons & Supplies^I don't know what they want with that mithral, but I can't let them leave these mountains with it. Their position in that valley can easily be defended against a mass assault. Sneak in there and sabotage their wagons and supplies. Once they run low on supplies, we'll wait until they send the wagons out for more and ambush them when the axles break. While you're at it, put out the forge, too! It takes days to get that forge hot enough to work mithral. If you put it out, it will slow them down considerably.
Miner Settlement^46^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^A Miner Setback^Lords' Alliance Report: Cult of the Dragon^Collect Miners' Rune Necklaces^All of Icehammer's miners carry rune necklaces as a form of identification in the event they are killed in a mining accident. This attack isn't an "accident" per se, but I suppose Lord Icehammer will still wish to compensate the miners' families. Could you recover the miners' necklaces so I can pass their names on to Lord Icehammer?
Lords' Alliance Report: Cult of the Dragon^46^Hazrah Stormhammer^Icespire Peak^Fitzhugh Montgomery^Protector's Enclave^Fix Their Wagon, Miner Settlement^Free Passage^Deliver Stormhammer's report to Fitzhugh Montgomery.^I've prepared a ledger for Montgomery detailing the impact of this Cult aggression on Lord Icehammer's mithral production and consequently his contribution to the Lords' Alliance. Please deliver it with my apologies.
A Miner Problem^60^Fitzhugh Montgomery^Protector's Enclave^Fitzhugh Montgomery^Icespire Peak^Lords' Alliance Report: Cult of the Dragon^^Disrupt the Cult of the Dragon's operations in the Mithral Mine^The Cult of the Dragon must be desperate for mithral. Despite the problems you caused them in Icespire Peak, they have returned and resumed their mining operation. Icehammer's forces are still tied down dealing with the Frost Goblin threat. I'd like to formally request your help on behalf of the Lords' Alliance. Go into the mine and disrupt the Cult's operation anyway you can. Destroy their equipment, rescue miners they have forced to work for them, whatever it takes. And... if some of the mithral the Cult has mined should make its way back here, the Lords' Alliance will be very grateful.
Freedom Pass^52^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Marching Orders^Emerald Enclave Report: Cult of the Dragon^Rescue slaves and lead them to the top of Tagnik'zur pass^I have been leading slaves rescued from the Drow to safety through Tagnik'zur Pass for weeks now without any incident. A few days ago we were ambushed by the Cult of the Dragon as we neared the pass. The other rangers and I were able to hold them off for a time, but then a blue dragon showed up and the fight became a massacre. My comrades and many of the slaves were killed. I barely escaped with my life. Some of the slaves escaped and hid on the plateau above us. They are trapped up there unless someone can clear a path to the top of the pass. I think some have been captured by the Cult as well. Please go find them and lead them out of here! I would go but I am still weak from my wounds.
Emerald Enclave Report: Cult of the Dragon^52^Thar Greenbough^Rothé Valley^Protector's Enclave^Delrin Bass^Bottled Lightning, Freedom Pass^Forged in Fire, An Unlikely Alliance^Deliver Greenbough's report to Delrin Bass.^I've scratched down my thoughts on what the Cult is up to here in Rothé Valley. Could you please deliver it to Delrin Bass in Protector's Enclave? Also, let him know that I'm on the mend and there is no need to send anyone to replace me. I want to see this through to the end. It's a shame a place as lovely as this is host to such violence and bloodshed. 
An Unlikely Alliance^60^Shay Cutter^Protector's Enclave^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Emerald Enclave Report: Cult of the Dragon, Illithid Enclave^A Sign of Good Faith^Talk to Drann Barrow in the Whispering Caverns^You seem surprised to see a member of the Zhentarim associating with such... ethical... people. My work takes me where the Zhentarim's interests lie and currently those interests are best served by participating in this little alliance of convenience. The growing power of the Cult of the Dragon threatens all of us, the stability of the entire Sword Coast, and possibly more. Specifically, the Cult's operations in Whispering Caverns have place the Zhentarim in a difficult diplomatic situation that could lead to outright war with the Drow. I can so no more here -- too many suspicious ears -- but I ask you to speak to my associate Drann Barrow in Whispering caverns and give him what assistance you can.
A Sign of Good Faith^60^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^An Unlikely Alliance^Paper Trails, Ritual Behavior^Destroy the Drow Poison Shipments in Zasraena.^I sense you have your suspicions about working with me. Perhaps this will prove I am sincere. The drow operate a lucrative trade in rare and expensive poisons. We have been known to purchase some of them ourselves for certain... clients. To show I am in earnest, I am prepared to share with you the location of several such shipments. I trust you realize that this jeopardizes an extremely valuable association with the drow. It is not something we would do unless we felt the Cult of the Dragon posed an even greater threat to us all.
Paper Trails^60^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^A Sign of Good Faith^Treasure Seekers^Collect 3 Zhentarim Maps from the Cultists in the southwest of the Whispering Caverns.^Hopefully that show of faith has established a degree of trust between us. Maybe now you could do something for me. After their split with the drow in Rothe Valley, the Cult turned to us, seeking passage in secret down here to the Whispering Caverns. Of course, we were only too keen to oblige... for a price, naturally. We provided them with multiple maps detailing secret routes in the Caverns; ways that avoided drow patrols. However, we have since learned of the Cult's recent activities and it is clear now what a threat they pose. As a result, we are very keen to recover those documents so there is nothing the drow could discover that would implicate us and threaten our continued... commercial involvement... with them.
Ritual Behavior^60^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^A Sign of Good Faith^Treasure Seekers^Search the Cult's tents for evidence of their plans.^After we helped the cult get down here, they started bringing in various arcane supplies, which their leader, Dragonsoul Thanin, was careful to keep hidden from us. Whatever the cult is up to down here, the truth lies in Thanin's possession. If you can get your hands on some of his books, perhaps you can discover whatever it is they're planning.
Treasure Seekers^60^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Ritual Behavior^Zhentarim Report: Cult of the Dragon^Free 5 Enslaved Diggers in the Searing Reach.^Thanin has learned that the ancient dragon, Saphirax, had a vast hoard, but the history books do not record its location. Thanin has decided the hoard must still be near her nest and is searching for any sign of it. The Cult of the Dragon has brought slaves from Rothé Valley to the Whispering Caverns to perform the manual labour. Free the enslaved miners and do your best to disrupt the Cult's search.
Zhentarim Report: Cult of the Dragon^60^Drann Barrow^Whispering Caverns^Shay Cutter^Protector's Enclave^Treasure Seekers^Ancient Treasures^Deliver Barrow's report to Shay Cutter^This is a delicate situation if there ever was one. I'm going to need further instructions on how to proceed. Please take this assessment back to Shay Cutter in Protector's Enclave and find out how she wishes to handle this. You seem trustworthy, so I'll tell you now that it is in your best interest if the seal remains unbroken.
The Portal to Tuern^60^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Zhentarim Report: Cult of the Dragon^Protecting the Portal^Secure the Portal to Tuern in Icewind Dale.^Now that we've discovered how to activate the portal in Icewind Dale, we need to secure it as soon as possible. I'm sure the Cult of the Dragon is moving to do the same even as we speak. The factions are mobilizing, but I and the other faction representatives are putting together a small vanguard to arrive ahead of the main force so we can establish our presence as soon as possible. You've done so much to help ensure the Cult does not gain a foothold. We would be honored to have your aid in this as well.
Protecting the Portal^60^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^The Portal to Tuern^^Repel the Cult of the Dragon attack on the Portal to Tuern.^The factions have taken the portal to Tuern, but the Cult of the Dragon hasn't given up. They've been launching attacks against our defenses there, testing us, waiting for us to let our guard down. The portal is really out in the middle of nowhere, and it's difficult to keep a large force stationed there. If you could give us a hand with the defense, it'd be a big help.
Locate Longboats^42^Grindle Strongheart^Pirates' Skyhold^Grindle Strongheart^Pirates' Skyhold^^An Offer of Friendship^Grindle wants you to locate 3 Sky Longboats, the Sky Skiff, the Lark and the Lamprey for later salvage.^Brandy Quickstep has made a tempting trade offer to Company Yargo, proposing that we send small, frequent shipments between Skyhold and Neverwinter. It's a good plan, but unfortunately Company Yargo is short on vessels for the operation. Of course, that's part of the reason we're here. Along with full fledged skyships, there are bound to be some longboats scattered around that we could salvage and put into service. If you can take this map and confirm the locations of three such vessels in the nearby swamp, I'll be able to organize an expedition to recover them properly. 
An Offer of Friendship^43^Grindle Strongheart^Pirates' Skyhold^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Locate Longboats^^Grindle has shown you the location of a chest of Buried Gold, recover it to seal the deal with Company Yargo.^You may have heard dubious tales about Company Yargo. Mostly slander, of course! But there is a certain something to be said for providing a golden incentive to seal a deal. Now, I'm an altruistic halfling, so I'm going to help out my friends in New Neverwinter by giving you a little tip. The river that runs off the mote just a bit down the road hides a hidden chest of treasure. I found a pirate's journal that suggested as much anyway. Find it and "donate" it to the Company, and you'll get the halflings of Neverwinter into their weightiest considerations. 
Factional Assets^60^Elminster Aumar^Well of Dragons^Elminster Aumar^Well of Dragons^The Well of Dragons^Lay of the Land, Sacrificial Victims, Skin and Bones, An Extended Rest^Speak to the gathered Faction Representatives.^Do ye see that gigantic temple in the distance behind me? That's Tiamat's temple, and it burst forth from the ground not too long before ye arrived. Its appearance portends that it's too late to prevent Tiamat from ascending to our world. The best we can do is slow the cult's progress in trying to summon her, and prepare for her inevitable arrival. Then we can worry about sending her back. You'll notice that representatives from Faerûn's most influential factions are stationed in this camp, including some rather unlikely allies. You may even notice some familiar faces. Each one plays an important part here, so I'd like you to report for duty with each representative. They'll brief you on their roles, and let you know if they have any immediate tasks for you.
Lay of the Land^60^Preceptor Theraclast^Well of Dragons^Preceptor Theraclast^Well of Dragons^Factional Assets^^Travel to 5 Vantage Points and Scout the Area.^We expect chromatic dragons to come to these lands in advance of Tiamat's arrival, in order to pay tribute to their goddess. Many of these dragons have attacked countless villages over the years while building their wealth, and now we have an opportunity to strike back against them. Our vampiric ally, Sandesyl Morgia, belongs to the Cult of the Dragon old guard. She insists that the locations you'll be visiting were used to receive dragons for the cult's dracolich creation rituals. If she is to be believed, then it makes sense that the dragons will arrive in those spots. Now that we know where to expect them, we'd like you to go ahead and scout these locations, then report back with your findings. Assuming the information is good, you'll be prepared to join in the strike against them when the time comes.
Skin and Bones^60^Sandesyl Morgia^Well of Dragons^Sandesyl Morgia^Well of Dragons^Factional Assets^^Destroy 5 dragon bone carts.^The Cult of the Dragon is preparing to produce more drakes. They've salvages bones and other remains from the dragons who came here to die over the years, and enchanted them as part of their alchemical drake creation process. It would set them back considerably if someone were to destroy their hard work at this point in the process. I nominate you.
Sacrificial Victims^60^Linu Laneral^Well of Dragons^Linu Laneral^Well of Dragons^Factional Assets^^Rescue 5 prisoners.^The Cult of the Dragon plans to summon Tiamat into this world. Imagine how horrible that would be! But to do this they must make a great offering to the Dragon Queen consisting of treasure and sacrificial victims. In addition to this mass sacrifice, the cult has five sacrificial victims they have specially prepared for this ritual, one for each of Tiamat's heads. They're keeping them prisoner in some nearby cave in the Well of Dragons. Please, for their sake, head into the Cult Prison and rescue those sacrificial victims!
Reclaiming the Hoard^60^Elminster Aumar^Well of Dragons^Elminster Aumar^Well of Dragons^^^Collect Dragon Hoard Coffers from cultists, Thayans, and dragons, then return them to the Reclaimed Tiamat Hoard. Defeat Cultists and Thayans.^As ye well know, the Cult of the Dragon has been raiding cities and robbing people of their valuables. The blasted thieves plan to offer it all to Tiamat as tribute when she arises. To make matters worse, this added show of faith and support in the dragon goddess will only strengthen her. We need to reclaim as much of the treasure as possible in order to weaken the cultists' summoning ritual. Bring it back to me, and I'll make sure it gets delivered back to those from whom it was taken. If ye also happen to thrash any cultists or Thayans while you're out there, it will only make our fight easier when the time comes to face Tiamat.
The Return of Tiamat^60^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^^The Well of Dragons^Speak to Harper Boward in Protector's Enclave.^I have grim news to report. We now know what Severin's Cult of the Dragon has been up to, and the situation is dire, to say the least. They have allied with the Red Wizards of Thay to perform a ritual with the intent of raising the evil dragon goddess, Tiamat, from the depths of the Nine Hells. Needless to say, the return of the five-headed Dragon Queen would be catastrophic to all of Faerûn. You should speak with Harper Boward. She has more details, and can direct you on where to go next, assuming you have an interest in saving the world.
Heal the Breach^33^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^^^Slay Erinyes or Hellfire Magi in the Watcher's Forest^A single Hellfire Magus or Erinyes devil is a powerful foe, but gathered in numbers they present a greater threat by weakening the barriers between our world and the Nine Hells. Slaying these fiends must be a priority, or the Ashmadai will be able to easily summon more fiends to replace those we have slain.
Network Repair^42^Irrae^Pirates' Skyhold^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Every Last Drop^A Skyship's Remains, Reclamation^Repair the 5 Fraying Ropes along the rope bridges in Vilebog, then report to Scout Tragold.^There's more wrong with this swamp than the water. It's like the air is poisoned too. Well, not quite poisoned, but things here seem to be in need of repair more often than I'd expect. Our scouts set up a series of rope bridges over the floating earth motes nearby in order to explore deeper into the swamp. Trouble is, the ropes of the bridges keep fraying. Make your way around that area and fix up any ropes that need fixing. Speak to the scouts there once you've taken care of the problem.
A Skyship's Remains^42^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Network Repair^^Search 5 Piles of Wreckage near the Wreck.^Over here at this end of the awful bog is the reason Company Yargo landed us in this place: the wreckage of a skyship. They say it used to be called the Magister's Hope, or something like that. There's a problem, though. The lizards. They're all over the place near the wreck. Probable near their tribal grounds or something, given our luck. Anyway, I'm not being paid enough to try to fight a horde of lizardfolk. Maybe they're paying you more, though, so if you want to take the job of searching through the wreckage, you can have it.
Reclamation^42^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Network Repair^Ahead to Skull Fortress^Slay The Scalefather in Scalefather's Hollow^If' we're gonna find what Captain Yargo wants us to find, we need to get these lizards out of here. While I was scouting out the area ahead I saw that they were coming and going from a small cave. My guess is that's where their leader is. If you take the leader out, maybe the lizards will back off, and we might actually be able to do a thorough search and salvage of the area. Meaning we all get paid and the captain gets what she wants. No one but the lizards get their throats cut and everyone's happy.
Eviction^42^Ranger Thoros^Pirates' Skyhold^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Ahead to Skull Fortress^Search and Seizure^Slay 12 Greenscale Hunters or Greenscale Darters in the Sunken Town.^There's a town up ahead the swamps turned into a mod hole. Just the kind of place the lizardfolk like. The place is crawling with them, and that's a big problem for us. One of our scouts went out there and hasn't come back. My guess... The lizards killed him, or he escaped and he can't make it back to us. Go cut through the lizards in town and see if you can't find our man. He's a halfling named Shaben Shortcloak.
Ahead to Skull Fortress^42^Scout Tragold^Pirates' Skyhold^Ranger Thoros^Pirates' Skyhold^Reclamation^Eviction^Speak with Ranger Thoros near Skull Fortress.^While you were off killing lizardfolk, I got a message from our scouting party we sent off a few days ago. I figured they were dead, but I guess they're tougher than I gave them credit for. According to their message, not only are they alive, but they found something beyond the swamp. I'm going to relay this back to base camp. Why don't you trek on ahead and meet up with them to see what they found?
The Well of Dragons^70^Harper Boward^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Well of Dragons^^Factional Assets^Speak to Elminster in the Well of Dragons.^Severin's Cult of the Dragon is gathering an army with their new Thayan allies in a place called the Well of Dragons, several hundred miles to the southeast of here. All the while, they've been raiding towns up and down the Sword Coast, amassing a vast hoard of treasure, and taking prisoners. According to our information, this all leads to one conclusion: Severin is planning a ritual to summon the dragon goddess, Tiamat from the Nine Hells! This is a matter that concerns all of Faerûn. Elminster himself is calling upon representatives from all over to meet him at the Well of Dragons. We could also use any support we can get from heroic adventurers like yourself. Journey to the Well of Dragons and speak with Eminster. We'll meet you there. Your part in this will truly decide the fate of Faerûn.
Shields of Vigilance^33^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^^^Recover the Shields of Helm found in the Helmite crypts deep in the Watcher's Forest.^I've learned that the Ashmadai have broken into the Helmite crypts in search of the Shields of Helm. Though Helm is long dead, the arms and armor he blessed still hold great power. If the Ashmadai use their profane rituals to desecrate them, the shields could be transformed into powerful artifacts of evil. The shields must be recovered before that can come to pass. The crypts are marked by stone towers in the forests north and east of Helm's Hold. I would suggest you start your search there.
An Uncertain Master^32^Investigator Rannigan^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Warning Your Enemies^More Questions Than Answers^Collect 3 Ashmadai Pact Blades from Hellfire Warlocks in Scar Alley in Helm's Hold and return then to Brother Satarin.^We meet again. And once more you've... coincidentally shown up at an opportune time. What I'm about to say may not entirely make sense, but hear me out. I don't think that this invasion of Helm's Hold is part of the Ashmadai's larger plan. It may be a distraction, or perhaps these devils and cultists have been tricked into serving another master. In order to figure this out, I want you to retrieve pact blades from the Ashmadai warlocks and bring then to Brother Satarin. He will be able to identify whether those blades are pacted to Asmodeus or to something else.
More Questions Than Answers^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Investigator Rannigan^Helm's Hold^An Uncertain Master^Piercing Deceit^Report your and Brother Satarin's findings to Investigator Rannigan in Helm's Hold.^... Investigator Rannigan is right. These blades that you brought me aren't pacted to Asmodeus. I can't tell who they are pacted to now. That would take much more time and a stronger ritual. But I can tell the Supreme Master of the Nine Hells' influence is missing. I'm... not sure where this leaves your investigation, however. You should talk to Rannigan and tell him what we found.
Piercing Deceit^34^A Mysterious Note^Helm's Hold^Cloaked Tiefling^Helm's Hold^More Questions Than Answers^The Servants' Souls^Enter the Ruined House and meet the informant there.^The note is written with exquisite penmanship and is adressed to you:"<name>, if you wish to find out more about the ones truly behind the invasion of Helm's Hold, come to the ruined house at the southeast corner of Helm's Hold. I will be waiting."
The Servants' Souls^34^Cloaked Tiefling^Helm's Hold^Vichorn Vrockwing^Helm's Hold^Piercing Deceit^Ashmadai Secrets^Collect 5 Devil Soul Dust from Ashmadai devils in Helm's Hold.^I am a high-ranking member of the Ashmadai, and as you now know, this invasion of Helm's Hold was not our plan. I'm certain you have questions to ask me, and in exchange for cooperation, I will answer them to the extent of which I am able. Take this artifact. If you slay a devil while you have it in your possession, some of the devil's soul will be left behind as a dusty residue. Collect this dust and return here. My assistant will wait for you to retrieve the dust. Succeed, and will uncover the information we both seek.
Justice Among Thieves^44^The Judge's Gavel^Pirates' Skyhold^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Show The Judge's Gavel to Norver the Cook.^After clearing out the Blackdagger pirates' kangaroo court, you found this gavel dropped by the pirate called "The Judge". The mutineers will be happy to know that this judge sits on the bench no longer.
Devil Divining^49^Investigator Rannigan^The Chasm^Loravyre Impkith^The Chasm^The Servants' Souls^Ashmadai Secrets^Place 3 Divining Circles in the Chasm, then report to Loravyre Impkith.^I thought you'd show up. One day I'll figure out how you get your information... I'm here with Loravyre Impkith, a wizard of the Neverwinter Guard. I have information that suggests Ashmadai activity here in the Chasm. Loravyre has been conducting divining rituals to locate the Ashmadai agents, but the spellplague pall hereabouts is interfering. I need you to go into the field and setup some magic circles according to these specifications. Loravyre says they'll attune the ritual properly, or something. I'm an investigator, not a wizard. Once you're done, find Loravyre in Fort Precipice. She'll tell you what to do next. 
Ashmadai Secrets^49^Loravyre Impkith^The Chasm^Loravyre Impkith^The Chasm^Devil Divining^The Hellthorn Traitor^Recover the Strange Items that Loravyre sensed in the possession of Ashmadai devils in the Chasm.^During my ritual I sensed strong diabolic presence to the north, near the teleportation gate. There was also something else... I believe that Ashmadai agents, likely some manner of summoned devils, carry several strange items that are important in some way to Ashmadai interests. Regretfully my ritual did not reveal any further specifics. However, if you are able to locate and overcome these Ashmadai, you can retrieve these items that they are carrying, and we will be able to attempt to discern what manner of importance they hold to the Ashmadai.
The Hellthorn Traitor^57^Investigator Rannigan^Mount Hotenow^Investigator Rannigan^Mount Hotenow^Ashmadai Secrets^^Enter the Duergar Stronghold and Rescue Nimor Ironvice from his captors.^Ah, <name>. I was finally able to identify the material you recovered from the Chasm. It's an exotic red metal with diabolic properties called hellthorn. Interestingly, hellthorn is only mined in the Underdark. Once I knew the Ashmadai had contacts in the Underdark, I was able to requisition our best diviner. They discovered that the weapons were sold to the Ashmadai by some renegade duergar named Nimor Ironvice. Unfortunately, Nimor's activities didn't escape notice. He was arrested and is being held in a duergar stronghold beneath Mount Hotenow. If you could bring this Nimor Ironvice back to us for questioning, Neverwinter would be grateful.
Echoes of Illefarn^33^Meryth Heartwood^Helm's Hold^Meryth Heartwood^Helm's Hold^Sapping the Will^Past Redemption^Defeat 5 Ashmadai Relic Hunters northwest of Helm's Hold.^The Prophet fooled us. Everything she did was a ruse. Her cultists wander the forest, searching, and I know what for. In ancient times, the elves of Illefarn built portals that would link distant parts of the kingdom. They built them not for war, but for beauty. Each of these portal chains was activated by lyrics of a song or ballad. One such portal hides within these woods. The cultists have found it, but do not know its song. Now they hunt for clues, carvings, plagues, sculpture. Drive off the Ashmadai Relic Hunters. Do not allow them to learn the song.
Past Redemption^33^Meryth Heartwood^Helm's Hold^Meryth Heartwood^Helm's Hold^Echoes of Illefarn^Religious Cultivation^Activate and defend the Song Portal northeast of Helm's Hold until it collapses.^Song paths were works of art. A singer would lead an audience through beautiful vistas of historical places, where illusions would recreate the events described in the song. When Illefarn fell, the song portals were ordered destroyed, lest they fall into enemy hands. But some caretakers could not bring themselves to destroy their beloved works of art. Take this stone to open the song portal for a few moments. During this time it is vulnerable. Defend the collapsing portal from the Ashmadai. When the portal closes, it will take with it one last memory of our ancient and lost glory.
Religious Cultivation^40^Celebryth Stormraven^Vellosk^Celebryth Stormraven^Vellosk^Past Redemption^Lifting Shadow^Tend 3 Shrines to Corellon near the Tribal Pit in Vellosk.^For centuries, I have tended the shrines of Corellon. Long before the Uthgardt tribesmen settled this place, elves inhabited these woods. Here, we worshiped the Seldarine in all their forms. Now, I am the last caretaker of our sacred shrines. Months ago, I came into contact with a servant of Shar who cursed me. I've been wasting away ever since, with my connection to Corellon severed. I accept my fate, but I cannot bear to see the shrines fall into decay. I know it is much to ask, but for your kinsman and for your people's god, will you tend the shrines?
Lifting Shadow^41^Celebryth Stormraven^Vellosk^Celebryth Stormraven^Vellosk^Religious Cultivation^Blood Fuel^Defeat the Shadar-kai Witch in Twilight Reach in Vellosk.^The creature that cursed me still lives. Perhaps that is why this curse is so potent. It may be that if the perpetrator were to be slain, the curse would weaken and my connection to Corellon could be reestablished. Could you do this for me, <name>? Slay the Shadar-kai Witch and lift this shadow over my soul? She dwells in an area north of here known as Twilight Reach. Please... I do not have much more time...
Burning Heart Task Force^66^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Taking the Forge^Commercial Interest^Complete Vigilance Tasks within the Fallen Halls and the Great Forge areas in the Fiery Pit.^If what I'm hearing is true, and the cultists are using the Great Forge to create their devastation orb, then we must act fast. The dwarves have always been careful with the delicate balance between the forge and Maegera. It's possible the cultists don't mind if they wake the primordial. We had better find out more. Our allies need your support. Be always vigilant, and we'll put an end to this.Vigilance Tasks are hourly repeatable quests.
The Long Night^67^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Commercial Interest^Water Pumps Task Force^Speak to Captain Montrose in the Fiery Pit.^Remember the missing dwarven prisoners I was speaking of? Seems the cult has some nefarious plan for them. I urge you to speak with Captain Montrose about this at once. She has more details. The poor woman hasn't had an ounce of rest since this started. She'll appreciate your diligence.
The Dragonborn^4^Emissary Surina, Sergeant Korinn, Patrin Yrthraz, Kriv the Scribe^Protector's Enclave^General Bharash^Protector's Enclave^^^Meet with General Bharash in Protector's Enclave.^Hero, the leader of the dragonborn army in Neverwinter has asked me to tell you that he wishes an audience with you. His name is General Bharash, and you can find him at the top of the West Courtyard at the Hall of Justice.
Going to Seed^60^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^^No Crevice Untouched^Speak to Archdruid Morningdawn in Protector's Enclave.^You may have noticed the large statue of Lord Neverember that once graced the central plaza of Protector's Enclave has been replaced with a large tree. This is the Tree Of Elemental Balance. According to Archdruid Morningdawn, it is the city's only defense against a new threat rising in the Sword Coast. Lord Neverember is taking this threat quite seriously and would like you to render what assistance you can to the Archdruid. You can find her near the tree in the central plaza.
No Crevice Untouched^20^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^^Hard to Reach Places^Investigate the elemental disturbance in Ebon Downs^As a druid I'm committed to maintaining a balance between the various forces of nature. Temporary imbalances are to be expected and usually sort themselves out. Recently, however, the currents of the elemental forces throughout the Sword Coast have changed in ways that are causing dangerous concentrations of the elements. The Tree of Elemental Balance allows me to affect this flow, but my attempts to stabilize things have been unsuccessful. I believe that someone, or something, is deliberately redirecting the elemental flow. Druids of the Emerald Enclave have reported sensing a building pressure of both Earth and Water in the region of Ebon Downs. Minsc has volunteered to investigate this anomaly, but I believe more than his zeal may be required to deal with the situation. I would appreciate it if you would accompany him.
Hard to Reach Places^20^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^No Crevice Untouched^Swords for Everyone!^Investigate the mysterious monks.^The Black Earth Mercenaries were entrusted with the protection of Helm's Hold. The fact that they are secretly a cult is of grave concern to Lord Neverember. The elemental seeds you recovered have restored balance for a while, but the cult will seek others to power their node. Whatever their ultimate aim with this node, we must recover more elemental seeds. Preventing them from falling into the cultists' hands buys us time to discover their plans. To that end I ask you to venture to Pirates' Skyhold, where Zhentarim agents have noticed some suspicious characters in the guise of monks. There may be nothing to it, but we must be vigilant. Minsc will meet you there.
Swords for Everyone!^20^Minsc^Protector's Enclave^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Hard to Reach Places^Coast Guarding, Reclaiming the Rock, The Fiery Pit, Trouble on the Winds^Protect the Tree of Elemental Balance from Cultist Attackers.^Now that Morningdawn knows what the cultists are planning, she fears they will try to destroy her balancing tree. This we must not allow! Neverwinter guards are brave and strong, but they are not heroes. You, me, and Boo, we are heroes! The three of us should stand guard over the tree. Go and relieve one of the guards on duty when you are ready to stand watch. No evil will escape out vigilance!
Coast Guarding^20^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Swords for Everyone!^Herbal Remedy, Dangerous Alliance^Meet with the Emerald Enclave leader Flora Newleaf in the Drowned Shore.^The Tree of Elemental Balance is safe, and so - for the time being - is Neverwinter. The elemental cults are not beaten however, we need to find where they are operating and put a stop to their plans.  I've received word a freak tidal wave struck the coast near the Blackdagger Ruins a short time ago. It doesn't take a genius to see the hand of Gar Shatterkeel and the Cult of the Crushing Wave in this "unnatural" disaster. Fortunately, the Emerald Enclave has operatives working in that region. Travel to the Drowned Shore - that's what they are calling it now - and meet with Flora Newleaf. She should be able to tell you more.
Staying Vigilant^61^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Coast Guarding^Goldseeker's Folly^Complete 8 Vigilance Tasks in the mines area of Drowned Shore.^There is much you can do to help secure our position in this region, but the situation is volatile and changing by the hour. We could certainly use your help in dealing with these threats. Bellan Norell, Alinda Greenwood and Udo Stonekin have need of your courage and skill. Speak to them if you wish to help.
Goldseeker's Folly^61^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Staying Vigilant^Harper Help^Enter Goldseeker's Folly in the Mines region of Drowned Shore and defeat Morgan Shivertimber.^The mine known as Goldseeker's Folly seems to be of special interest to the Crushing Wave. It's clear they don't want anyone entering there. One of our rangers overheard some lizardfolk speaking of a cultist known as Morgan Shivertimber who has arrived to direct the defense of the mine. I'd like to see you eliminate this Shivertimber before she has a chance to enact her plans.
Harper Help^61^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Goldseeker's Folly^Keeping Vigil^Meet with the Harper Seven Toes at the Harper spy post near the High Road North in Drowned Shore.^We've been working together with the Harpers in our fight against the Crushing Wave. Right now the Harper agent called Seven Toes is manning a spy post near the North Road, you should speak with him. I'm certain the Harpers can make good use of your special talents.
Gutting Fish^20^Rast Marwood or any Zhentarim Agent^Drowned Shore^Any Zhentarim Agent^Drowned Shore^^Show of Force^Defeat Crushing Wave forces in the Drowned Shore.^These tree-lovers! They have a problem with a ruthless enemy and it's all "gather this" and "scout that". Pathetic! We Zhentarim, we have a better solution: You got a problem with an enemy? Kill 'em! Kill 'em all! Sea trolls, lizards, hags, cultists... If it smells like brine then kill it! Kill enough of 'em and I'll see you get a reward.
Alinda's Bounty^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^^^Collect Olhydra's Emblems from hostile creatures in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^We simply cannot allow the Cult of the Crushing Wave and their allies to jeopardize the elemental balance of our plane. Therefore I am offering you a bounty of sorts. Bring me several of the emblems of Olhydra that many of our enemies wear and I will see you are rewarded for it.
Goldseeker's Folly: Mine Rescue^62^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Reporting In, Worrisome Wares^Scaly Persuasion, Caravan Vengeance^Enter Goldseeker's Folly in the Mines region of Drowned Shore and free Captive Miners.^I've just got word that some of Udo Stonekin's miners were taken captive by the cult. Seems like he got ahead of himself and tried to resume his operations in Goldseeker's Folly before we were done with rooting out the cult. The cult is clearly using this as a diversion, but we can't let those miners be taken in as slaves. Can you rescue them before it's too late?
Goldseekers Folly: Rogues Gallery^61^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^^^Enter Goldseeker's Folly in the Mines region of Drowned Shore and defeat Razor Maw, Miasma and Pike.^There are three potent champions among our enemies who are using Goldseeker's Folly as their base of operations. I'd like you to enter the mine and eliminate the sea troll called Razor Maw, the lizardfolk Miasma and the halfling cultist known as Pike.
Healing Harvest^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^^^Gather Vaundyr Vine Blooms and Berronar's Cap Mushrooms in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^When all magical healing is exhausted one has to fall back on traditional herbal lore. Fortunately we druids are quite knowledgeable in the use of healing plants of all sorts. Unfortunately we have been so hard pressed that our herbal stores are dwindling rapidly. If you could gather a supply of Vaundyr's Vine blooms and Berronar's Cap Mushrooms it just might mean the difference between life and death for our wounded. Vaundyr's Vine can be found clinging to rocks and cliffs throughout this area, while Berronar's Cap grows in the darkness of the mines.
Herbal Malady^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^^^Collect Gurglewort Sap and add it to Humanoid Food Crates in the Glimmerstone Mine in Drowned Shore.^Our enemies have been bringing up fish from the sea to feed their soldiers. That gives me an idea that may slow them down a bit. There is a certain plant growing abundantly in this area called gurglewort. The plant has beautiful blooms, but the sap in its stalks causes... Internal distress to anyone unfortunate enough to ingest it. Collect gurglewort sap and add it to the crates of fish the humanoids have stockpiled in their underground lairs. That should render a good many of them unfit for combat.
Mysterious Symbol^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^^^Kill hostile creatures in the Drowned Shore to recover a Mysterious Symbol then compare it to images in Yolander's Books.^We've noticed a strange symbol etched on items worn by these aquatic invaders. I'd like to know what it means. A sage called Yolander who was part of our order had in his possession a tome containing hundreds of symbols in use throughout the realms. Unfortunately, Yolander was killed in the creatures initial attack and we didn't think to collect his books. I'd like you to take a symbol from one of the aquatic humanoids and compare it to images in the book. You should still be able to find it in the camp where the sage was killed.
Needful Things^61^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^^^Recover Supply Crates from the Silver Drip and/or the Glimmerstone Mine in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^When the monsters drove us from the mines we found refuge with these Emerald Enclave folk. We barely escaped with our skins so we're forced to live on the charity of these rangers. It's not that we aren't grateful, but it stings a dwarf's pride to have to live like this. We left behind ample provisions in the mines, enough to feed us for a good long time. Could you gather up some of our provisions from the Silver Drip and Glimmerstone mines and return them to us?
Reptilian Reavers^61^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Lizardfolk in the Mines area of Drowned Shore.^If the lizardfolk decide to attack our position here in force we will have little chance of defeating them. But our chances improve with every lizardfolk warrior you vanquish. Aside from those that roam the hills nearby, there is a host of lizardfolk inhabiting the Glimmerstone Mine.
Sea Hag Slaying^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Sea Hags in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^The sea trolls and lizardfolk in this area seem to be taking their orders from a band of repellent sea hags. Hags are hateful creatures and the environment suffers all manner of corruption wherever they make their lairs. We cannot allow these hags to destroy the balance of nature along this coast. Seek out sea hags and slay them wherever you find them. I am told there are many hags hiding in the Silver Drip mine should you not find them roaming the hills nearby.
Sea Trolling^61^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Sea Trolls in the Mines region of Drowned Shore^Trolls have always been a menace to dwarven folk, but I never thought they'd come swimming up outta the ocean to try and eat us! Why don't you see if you can drive 'em right back where they belong?
Shock Troops^61^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Sea Trolls in the Silver Drip Mine and kill Lizardfolk in the Glimmerstone Mine located in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^In the wake of the tidal wave a host of aquatic humanoids swarmed ashore, driving back our rangers and occupying the entire region. Raids from such creatures are not uncommon along the Sword Coast but it is unusual for them to remain for so long. They even drove Udo Stonekin's folk from the mines in this area. The creatures have established strong points in the nearby Silver Drip and Glimmerstone mines. I fear we may not be able to maintain this foothold against another attack, from the humanoids, but if you were to reduce the number of enemies gathering in the mines our chances would improve. Sea trolls are abundant in the Silver Drip mine while lizardfolk can be found in the Glimmerstone mine.
Silver Strike^61^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^^^Gather Silver Ore from the Silver Drip Mine located in the Mines area of Drowned Shore.^Isn't it just my luck! Right before those soggy humanoids hit us we'd struck a nice vein of silver ore in Silver Drip Mine. I don't suppose the sea trolls recognize the value of the ore, and even if they do I'm sure they don't know how to smelt it. I'd sure be obliged if you were to gather up some of the silver ore and bring it back to us here.
Target: Deepclaw^61^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the sea troll called Deepclaw in the Silver Drip Mine located in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^The toughest sea troll in the mines is a terrible critter known as Deepclaw. I'd rest a lot easier knowin' that Deepclaw was outta the picture. Think you can take care of that for me?
Target: Riptide Molly^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the sea hag known as Riptide Molly in the Mines area of Drowned Shore.^The chief sea hag in these hills is a vile creature that goes by the name of Riptide Molly - hags seem to take delight in giving themselves darkly whimsical names like that. Molly roams from mine to mine overseeing the actions of the creatures under her command. Strike down Riptide Molly before she can do greater harm.
Target: The Tidemaster^61^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the lizardfolk shaman known as The Tidemaster in the Glimmerstone Mine located in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^Dwelling deep within the mines is a lizardfolk shaman known as the Tidemaster. His spells have laid low more than one of my rangers. I would be very pleased to know they were avenged. Return to me when the Tidemaster is no more.
War Machines^20^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Cultist's Folly^Worrisome Wares, Life Guarding^Destroy Ballistae and Ammunition near Blackdagger Ruins in Drowned Shore.^You need to meet with a Harper agent called Seven Toes. He's made camp with several others deeper in the Drowned Shore. Unfortunately, the Cult of the Crushing Wave have also discovered this camp and are moving siege weapons from Blackdagger Keep to eliminate them. Please, you have to destroy the siege weapons, then meet with Seven Toes and tell him about what we found. Good luck, <name>. We'll be cheering for you back here.
Keeping Vigil^62^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Harper Help^Sea Hag's Hold^Complete 8 Vigilance Tasks in the High Road and Blackdagger Keep areas of the Drowned Shore.^The Cult of the Crushing Wave and their aquatic allies have established a base of operations in Blackdagger Keep. From there they venture out to raid settlements and plunder merchant caravans throughout the region. We are going to need a lot of help to put an end to this evil. Your old friend Xalliana is sure to have need of your skills, likewise the Harper Lanric and the merchant Ranolf Kemp. Why don't you have a talk with them?
Sea Hag's Hold^62^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Keeping Vigil^Sole Survivor^Enter the Sea Hag's Hold at Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore and defeat Thuluna Maah.^According to all our scout reports, the enemy forces in Blackdagger Keep are under the command of a sea hag they call Thuluna Maah. I think you should put an end to this devious hag.
Sole Survivor^62^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Sea Hag's Hold^Seaside Vigil^Meet with Guard Harris behind the Broken Crown Inn in Drowned Shore.^While you were busy thrashing Thuluna Maah we learned some astonishing news. One member of the Neverwinter Guard contingent survived the tidal wave! He is encamped with a group of strange elves behind the Broken Crown Inn. You should probably speak to him.
Target: The Render^62^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the lacedon called The Render near the High Road North in Drowned Shore.^There is a lacedon of exceptional strength and power roaming near the ruins. I don't know if some especially powerful ritual was used to create this creature, or if it retains special powers it wielded in life. I must confess, I don't really care about the why and how. I do however, care about ridding the world of this abomination. We call it simply, the Render. You will find it skulking near the walls of Blackdagger Ruin.
Mossy Meg^62^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the Green Hag called Mossy Meg near Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^I had a run-in with a green hag who called herself Mossy Meg. I've fought hags before, but this one was a cut above the ordinary. Frankly, I barely escaped with my skin. I'd be more than happy if you could accomplish what I couldn't and bring down Mossy Meg.
Hateful Horrors^62^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^War Machines^Reporting In, Worrisome Wares^Kill Green Hags near Blackdagger Keep and the High Road in Drowned Shore.^The Cult of the Crushing Wave has sent out green hags to do their dirty work outside of Blackdagger Keep. Green hags like nothing better than bringing other creatures to complete and total ruin. Several of our agents have met their demise from these foul witches. Killing the hags will buy our agents the room necessary to get into the keep and give us information on how to strike at the cult.
Life Guarding^20^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^War Machines^Reporting In^Prevent Captives from being transformed into Lacedons near Blackdagger Keep and the High Road North in Drowned Shore.^Xalliana's chief concern is the destruction of the sea hags to prevent them from transforming anyone else into a lacedon, but I believe we must also focus on rescuing those who are held captive by the monsters. The green hags have taken several captives and plan on drowning them to begin the transformation process. Save these poor souls before they meet a fate worse than death!
Sea Hag's Hold: Down the Drain^62^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^^^Drain the Salt Water Pool in Sea Hag's Hold within Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^The humanoids have spent a great deal of time and effort hauling casks of sea water up from the shore and into Blackdagger Keep. I believe that somewhere in the fortress they call Sea Hag's Hold you will find a pool filled with that salt water. You see, both the sea hags and their sea troll servants require frequent immersion in salt water in order to operate at peak capacity. If you can drain that pool the enemy might have to abandon Blackdagger Ruin altogether, or at least we will force them to spend more time and effort to refilling their pool.
Crushing the Crushing Wave^62^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Crushing Wave Cultists in and near Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^It's clear to me that the root of all this trouble lies with these cultists - the Crushing Wave or whatever they call themselves. You should put an end to all you encounter. Once they are defeated things will quickly return to normal. At least that's my belief.
Attack on Blackdagger Keep^20^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Reporting In, Caravan Vengeance^One Small Lead^Destroy Enemy Supplies and Equipment and kill Enemy Combatants within the walls of Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^Our agents discovered a large stockpile of supplies that the cultists are using in the keep. We can strike at the cult by destroying these supplies... oh, and by killing as many of the cultists that you can. Just to be on the safe side, of course.
Undead from the Deep^62^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Lacedons near Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^I wish we had more time for pleasantries, my friend, but green hags have begun raising lacedons - ghouls created from the bodies of drowned victims - in the vicinity. An army of these creatures may be more than we can hope to handle. Go out and destroy any lacedons you can find.
Scaly Persuasion^62^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Goldseeker's Folly: Mine Rescue^Attack on Blackdagger Keep, Shifting the Numbers^Kill Cult of the Crushing Wave Agitators inciting lizardfolk around the High Road in Drowned Shore.^Lizardfolk are fiercely territorial and they have a disturbing taste for humanoid flesh, but it's unusual to find them leaving their home swamps and salt marshes. It seems the Cult of the Crushing Wave has learned how to whip this lizardfolk tribe into a frenzy. There are a significant number of cultists employed in keeping the lizards enthralled with propaganda. I'd like you to eliminate these cultist agitators.
Ranger Reports^62^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^^^Gather reports from Rangers stationed around the High Road in Drowned Shore.^Good intelligence is a must if we are to be successful in our fight against the Crushing Wave. The Harpers and the Emerald Enclave have stationed some of our best rangers in key locations around the High Road to keep an eye on the activities of the cult and their allies. These rangers have been instructed to keep careful tallies of troop movements and numbers. I'd like you to collect their latest reports so we can stay well informed on the latest enemy activities.
Sea Hag's Hold: Worse Than Death^63^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Combing for Secrets, Slade the Thricedrowned^The Ravenous Host, Stolen Memories^Free Captives being held in Sea Hag's Hold within Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^A group called the Harpers have contacted us asking for your help in the Blackdagger Keep. They say several merchants have attempted to return to the area, believing it was safe from the cultists. The vile sea hags have captured them and intend on transforming them into lacedons. I must implore you to return to Blackdagger Keep and save these poor people. We cannot let anyone else be harmed by these sea hags. Oh, and the Harpers say they've discovered another entrance into the keep.
Getting Goods^62^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^^^Take stolen Trade Goods from hostile creatures around the High Road and within Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^The cultists and their humanoid allies have plundered countless caravans and tradesmen along this stretch of the High Road. It would be a real help if you were to return any stolen trade goods you may find on these creatures to me. I belong to several trade associations and I can use my contacts to get those goods back to their rightful owners... Or at least their next of kin.
High Road Warning^62^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^^^Post Warning Messages on sign posts and milestones along the High Road in Drowned Shore.^My caravan might have avoided walking into that ambush had we only some warning about what lay ahead. We should do what we can to prevent others from suffering the same fate. I've penned some warning messages advising travelers to stay clear of this section of the high road. I'd like you to post them on road signs and milestones nearby. It's a small thing, but it could save lives.
Target: Maelstrom^62^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the Crushing Wave Cultist known as Maelstrom within Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore..^I lost more than goods and money when my caravan was attacked, I lost friends and associates. I may only be a traveling merchant not some gallant knight, but I still want vengence for this wrong. The leader of the raiders was a cultist they called Maelstrom. She's probably holed up somewhere in Blackdagger Keep. Strike her down in the name of my friends and I'll see you rewarded for it. 
Drowned Menace^62^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Lacedons near Blackdagger Keep and the High Road in Drowned Shore.^Being abducted and drowned by hags is a horrible fate, but how much more horrible is it to then be raised as a lacedon suffering from an insatiable, never-ending hunger for human flesh? We cannot allow this to continue. Destroy every lacedon you encounter. I understand there are many lacedon's infesting the old Cragmire Barrow south of here, should you not find them roaming the hills nearby.
Green-Eyed Monsters^62^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^Xalliana^Drowned Shore^^^Capture a Hag Eye from a Green Hag Coven near Blackdagger Keep and the High Road in Drowned Shore.^Hags often work together in covens of three. Together they can create something called a Hag Eye, this item allows them special magical powers when working together. We must not allow these covens to gain any further advantage over us. I need you to weaken a coven by capturing their Hag Eye.
Taking Stock^62^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^^^Recover stolen Merchant Wares from Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^My merchant train would have made me a good deal of money in the southlands, but then the bandits hit us and made off with everything. Now all I own is the clothes I'm standing in. If you are heading into Blackdagger Keep I would be grateful if you could keep your eyes open for any of my stolen goods. Anything you could return to me would be a great help in making a new start.
Seaside Vigil^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Sole Survivor^The Sea Druid^Complete 8 Vigilance Tasks in the Raven Cliff Beach area of the Drowned Shore.^The Cult of the Crushing Wave is responsible for the deaths of my comrades in the Neverwinter Guard and many sea elves as well. The fallen must be avenged and Gar Shatterkeel, the leader of the cult must be brought to justice! There are many tasks you can undertake to help us achieve that goal. I have a few things in mind, and my new friends Iolas and Seychell are certain to as well. Are you ready to get started?
The Sea Druid^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^Seaside Vigil^Hard Water^Meet with Greysen Shoreward near the last remaining lighhouse at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^If anyone will have a clue about this Water Node it will be the druid Greysen Shoreward. He concerns himself with the sea as much as the land. He's a friend to the Sea Elves and he's been spying on the cult's activities down by the shore. Go see him and see what he can tell you. Oh, and Greysen is using magic to keep hide his presence from the enemy as only a druid can. So don't be surprised by his "disguise".
Hard Water^63^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^The Sea Druid^Elemental Essence^Capture an Enchanted Flask from a Crushing Wave Warrior or One-Eyed Shiver at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^I'm certain Shatterkeel and his "Water Node" can be found within a nearby sea cave. But the cultists have erected a magical barrier of hard water to block the entrance to the cave. The Water Elementals pass freely through this barrier, as do certain, high-ranking members of the Cult. These latter, however, always anoint themselves with liquid from special flasks they carry before they can enter. Hunt down cultist lieutenants and bring me one of those flasks, then perhaps, we can learn how to pass the barrier.
Elemental Essence^63^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^Hard Water^The Water Node^Collect Elemental Essence from Water Elementals at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^The substance inside this flask appears to be... Water. Just simple water, but wait... There is something unusual about this. This is not water of this world. It is the very essence of elemental creatures from the Plane of Water. It makes sense now! The elementals can pass the hard water barrier and so to can those who anoint themselves with their essence. Your course is clear - clear as water- battle the Water Elementals serving the cult and gather enough of Elemental Essence to fill this flask.
The Water Node^63^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^Greysen Shoreward^Drowned Shore^Elemental Essence^Seed of Water^Enter the Water Node at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore and defeat Gar Shatterkeel.^Quickly! There is no time to lose. I witnessed the Cult of the Crushing Wave's leader, Gar Shatterkeel, leading a party past the hard water barrier. They were dragging a sea elf prisoner along with them. I don't know what they have planned but it cannot be good, for the elf or the Sword Coast. Rescue the elf, defeat Gar Shatterkeel and put a stop to the plans of the Cult of the Crushing Wave!
Seed of Water^20^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Crushing Gar Shatterkeel^^Draw the Seed of Water in the Drowned Shore and take it to the Tree of Elemental Balance in Protector's Enclave.^With the defeat of Gar Shatterkeel the Water Node has been weakened. Enough so that I sense an elemental water seed has been produced nearby. Such seeds contain the essence of elemental balance, but the presence of the Water Node has suppressed their production. Retrieve the seed and take it to the Tree of Elemental Balance in Neverwinter. Archdruid Morningdawn's creation will gain great strength from the seed.
Target: Hullbreaker^63^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the sea troll called Hullbreaker at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^My people are at constant war with the sea trolls. More often than not, it is the Alu'Tel'Quessar that get the better of those battles. But there is one troll that truly frightens me, a horrific brute they call Hullbreaker. Destroy Hullbreaker before he devours any more of my kin or sends more landwalker ships to the bottom of the sea.
The Water Node: Fight Water With Fire^63^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^^^Enter the Water Node at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore and light bonfires to suppress the Water Node.^I Have spoken with Greysen Shoreward and learned something of interest. He believes that the effectiveness of the Water Node as a conduit between planes can be reduced by the proximity of an elemental opposite - fire in this case. I highly doubt that something that powerful could be reduced by a few fires, but if we're burning their supplies and go through a few cultists... Well, I don't see the harm in indulging his theory don't you think?
Breathless^63^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Iolas^Drowned Shore^^^Recover a Necklace of Air Breathing from Crushing Wave Cultists at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^My kin and I would not long be able to walk upon the land and breathe the air without magical aid. Those of us who undertook this mission were given Necklaces of Air Breathing. Such magic is truly rare among my people and losing one of these items is a great loss. As you have seen, the Crushing Wave cultists are responsible for the death of more than one aquatic elf. I suspect that the killers may have taken the victims necklaces as loot, not understanding the full value of the item. I would ask you to punish the Crushing Wave killers and recover one of the stolen necklaces.
Stolen Memories^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Sea Hag's Hold: Worse Than Death^Taking Their Breath Away, No Room on the Shore^Recover Guardsman Mementoes from Crushing Wave Cultist at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^There's something I want you to do for me. Those cultists have picked through the wreckage caused by the tidal wave and recovered personal items from my slain comrades. I'd like to return those items to the guardsmen's families.
False Priests^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Crushing Wave Cultists posing as priests of Lliira in the Broken Crown Inn in Drowned Shore and learn what you can from their captive.^The Crushing Wave Cultists are posing as simple priests of Lliira who run the Fountain of Delights as a resort, offering soothing baths and meditation chambers. It's all a sham of course. Sometimes they arrange for clients to meet them at the Broken Crown Inn where they are abducted - probably to be transformed into Lacedons. We've learned that one such victim went into the inn this morning. If you can rescue her, maybe she will be able to provide information about the cult's plans. You can get into the cellar through a drain pipe nearby, that will let you take them by surprise. Be careful though, it will be hard fighting in close quarters.
Target: Slade the Thricedrowned^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^^^Kill the Crushing Wave cultist known as Slade the Thricedrowned at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^There's a cultist down by the shore who's probably a pretty good example of what kind of people we are dealing with. His name's Slade and he claims that he has been drowned on three different occasions but each time, instead of dying, he washed ashore stronger than he was before. He calls himself Slade the Thricedrowned because of this. I don't know if his story is true, but he certainly is strong enough. Why don't you see if you can take him down a notch?
A Seafood Diet^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^^^Gather Crab Meat and Eel Grass from Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^I'm not ashamed to say that I plundered food from the larder of the Broken Crown Inn after it was abandoned. But the Sea Elves can't eat such fare. They have been forced to get by with the meager stock of fish they can take from the mill pond here. There is plenty of good food from the sea available down at the shore, but gathering has proven very dangerous, what with the Crushing Wave and their allies swarming around the Fountain of Delights. If you could gather crab meat and some of the edible seaweed called eel grass it would go a long way toward keeping these folks strong and healthy.
Target: Surge^63^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Iolas^Drowned Shore^^^Destroy the Water Myrmidon called Surge at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^Foremost among the cult's water elementals is a living calamity known as Surge. My people would be much safer were you to eliminate this dire threat. Surge roams the tide waters of Raven Shore Beach.
Water Warriors^63^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Iolas^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Water Archons at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^The Cult of the Crushing Wave is abducting my people for some unknown purpose. By far their most effective agents for undertaking these abductions are their Water Archons who can move through the sea all but unseen. Help keep my people safe by destroying these sinister elemental creatures.
Beach Combing^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^^^Collect Salvage from Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^It's been tough trying to provide the bare necessities we need in order to keep up our efforts against the Crushing Wave. We have little in the way of money or trade goods. Regrettable as it may be, there is one source of goods that could keep us going - salvage. Since the lighthouses were destroyed there have been a number of shipwrecks off this treacherous shore. Plenty of useful goods have been washed ashore in the wake of those wrecks. There are far too many enemies down by the Fountain of Delights for us to risk searching for salvage, but you might be able to collect some. We would be obliged for anything you could bring back.
Waterbourne Warning^63^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^^^Launch Sea Elf Warning Buoys from shore locations marked with ship's wheels at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^I have prepared these magic buoys which will send out a signal to fellow sea elves, warning them to stay clear of this shore. They are intuned to the tides in this area and if launched from the proper location they will be carried to where they will be most effective. When we came ashore here I noted these optimal locations and marked them with steering wheels from the wrecks offshore. Will you take these down to the shore and set them adrift where you see the wheels?
Avenging the Guard^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^^^Kill Crushing Wave Cultists at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^My blood boils every time I think of the comrades I lost because of those madmen and monsters who call themselves the Crushing Wave. We cannot allow them to unleash another such disaster upon the world. The best way to do that is to destroy every single one of them. With each one that falls the spirits of my fallen friends will rest that much easier. Cut them down!
The Ravenous Host^20^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Archon Anarchy, Water in a Flask^No Room on the Shore^Kill Lacedons at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^Your kin are brave to go to sea in ships as they do, for Umberlee is a fickle goddess and many sailors meet their death drowned upon this treacherous shore. Those that perish such should be allowed to rest beneath the waves in peace, but the sea hags and the evil cultist have other plans for the dead - raising them as Lacedons to do their bidding. Have mercy on those lost souls; destroy the lacedons that roam Raven Cliff Beach.
Stemming the Tide^63^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Iolas^Drowned Shore^^^Destroy Water Elementals at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^The Water Node serves as a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. Olhydra must be sending her minions the water archons through the portal to aid the Cult of the Crushing Wave. Until we find a way to close the Water Node we will need to keep the number of archons in check. Destroy these invaders from another plane of existence. Show them they do not belong in our world.
Reclaiming the Rock^20^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Swords for Everyone!^Tombs of the Watchful, Scouting the Forest, Black Earth Survey^Meet with Dassar Truebow at the Ranger Camp in the Watcher's Forest^Helm's Hold is under dire threat from an elemental cult in the guise of the Black Earth mercenary company. We do not know their aims, and what's worse, they've erected a fortress called Reclamation Rock just outside of Helm's Hold, holding the city hostage. Neverwinter Ranger Dassar Truebow is waiting for you at a hidden lakeside camp near Helm's Hold. He'll have more information for you when you arrive.
Vigilance in the Forest^63^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Reclaiming the Rock^Open Council^Complete Vigilance Tasks in the Watcher's Forest.^The Cult of the Black Earth has taken control of the Watcher's Forest to train their soldiers. They also are desecrating tombs, robbing travellers, and calling up monsters to serve them. I have Baram Hannikar & Imbross Irri'Karr coordinating the effort to stop them, and they will need your assistance if we are to succeed.
Open Council^64^Dassar Truebow^Drowned Shore^Councilwoman Callum^Drowned Shore^Vigilance in the Forest^Holding the Line^Meet with Councilwoman Callum in the Cathedral of Helm.^Your work in the Watcher's Forest has weakend the Cult of the Black Earth enough that Councilwoman Allisara Callum thinks it is time to strike back at their control within Helm's Hold itself. You'll find her in the old Cathedral of Helm at the center of Helm's Hold. While the cultists patrol the streets, they don't dare enter the cathedral.
Black Earth Rumble^65^Vigilant Paladin^Reclamation Rock^Vigilant Paladin^Reclamation Rock^^^Kill Members of the Cult of the Black Earth anywhere in Reclamation Rock.^The Cult of the Black Earth have amassed quite the army. As you do your work with Hannikar or the others, I want you to go about destroying that army monster by monster and man by man.
Scouting Ascension^64^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Fighting the Earth, Black Earth Survey^Stealing Their Mettle, Grinding the Gravel^Thwart the Cult's Scouts in the Crypt of Ascension in the Watcher's Forest.^I've reviewed everything you've done so far and I believe I've discovered the cult's next move. They're sending scouts into one of the nearby crypts... for what purpose, I don't know. But we need to stop them before they either get what they want or defile yet another crypt belonging to Helm.
Adepts of Ascension^64^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Deployment Orders, Training Manuals, Stealing Their Mettle^Posting the Truth^Rescue Helmite Acolytes in the Crypt of Ascension in the Watcher's Forest.^The cultists have orders to go after the missing Helmite acolytes within the Crypt of Ascension. It appears that they've been chasing these acolytes throughout Helm's Hold and purposefully cornered them within the crypt, believing we wouldn't think to check there a second time. Let's prove them wrong. Go back to the crypt and rescue any of the acolytes you can find.
Tombs of the Watchful^20^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Reclaiming the Rock^Deployment Orders, Stealing Their Mettle, Training Manuals^Check that the cult hasn't desecrated the Paladin Tombs of the Watcher's Forest.^We know that the cult is searching for something here in the Watcher's Forest, and that the majority of the search is focused on the old paladin tombs dotted around the Watcher's Forest. I want you to investigate those tombs, and see if you can find any clues about what the cult is looking for.
Cult Infiltrators^63^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^^^Meet with Cult Infiltrators in the Watcher's Forest after clearing out the foes around them.^We have some spies of our our own who have infiltrated the cult. Clear out any cult members nearby who could blow their cover, then talk to them to get information.
Stealing Their Mettle^20^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Tombs of the Watchful, Scouting the Forest, Black Earth Survey^Adepts of Ascension^Steal Cult Training Weapons from Training Camps in the Watcher's Forest.^No matter how fanatical they are, the cultists need training weapons to teach their recruits how to fight. Steal these training weapons, and hopefully we can force them to rely more on zealotry than skill. Maybe we'll even dissuade people from joining the cult. In the meantime, I'll be giving Dassar a report on the information you gave me from the scouts. Perhaps he might have an idea on what else to do.
Scouting the Forest^20^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Reclaiming the Rock^Deployment Orders, Stealing Their Mettle, Training Manuals^Get Reports from Ranger Scouts in the Watcher's Forest^Greetings, <name>. I'm Imbross Irrikar, and I'm in charge of figuring out how to weaken our foes. Several of our scouts are in Watcher's Forest, observing the cultists and trying to determine the best way to strike them. Find these scouts and get their reports. We'll use whatever they find to determine our next course of action.
Black Earth Survey^20^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Reclaiming the Rock^Deployment Orders, Stealing Their Mettle, Training Manuals^Investigate Enemy Training Camps in the Watcher's Forest.^I need some time to think over what you found in the tombs. In the meanwhile, we know that the cultists have training camps spread throughout the area. We also know that they've been sending their trainees into Helm's Hold. Unfortunately, I do not know to what end... contact with the cathedral has been cut off. I want you to disrupt the activities in several of these camps, then return to me. Hopefully this will throw the cultists off and force them to reveal what they're planning.
Grinding the Gravel^64^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Scouting Ascension^Deployment Orders, Training Manuals^Kill Black Earth Mercenaries, Throwers, and Earth Archons.^ We targeted the backbone of the Black Earth cultists, now we'll go after their pawns. Take out as many of their mercenaries and throwers that you can, as well as their earth archons. Hopefully this will force them to divert their attention away from Helm's Hold, giving our missing acolytes time to become... not missing. If this doesn't work, then I'm afraid we'll need to send you on a manhunt.
Leading the Avalanche^63^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^^^Destroy Earth Archons in the Watcher's Forest^The cult has summoned Earth Archons to train their soldiers in the ways of elemental warfare, and lead them their worship of the Princes of Elemental Evil. These fanatics are trouble enough without help from outside our world. Destroy these Archons and send them back where they came from.
Cult Connection^63^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^^^Gather Mercenary Journals from Cultists in the Watcher's Forest.^The Cult's plans are difficult to learn from their orders, as they are written in codes. But perhaps their soldier's own words can betray them. They will not talk, of course, but their journals may hold information we can use.
Training Manuals^20^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Tombs of the Watchful, Scouting the Forest, Black Earth Survey^Adepts of Ascension^Search for Training Manuals in cult Training Camps in the Watcher's Forest.^We've received a request from Captain Dunfield to recover manuals detailing the cult's tactics. Recover several of these manuals from their camps or from the cultists themselves. Hopefully this will help Dunfield over in the frontlines.
Deployment Orders^20^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Imbross Irri'Karr^Reclamation Rock^Tombs of the Watchful, Scouting the Forest, Black Earth Survey^Adepts of Ascension^Search for Cult Deployment Orders in the Watcher's Forest.^We've received words of deployment orders being handed out to all of the cultists. Seems like Urnrayle's men are getting ready for something, and I want to believe it has something to do with our missing Helmite acolytes. Recover these orders from the cultists and bring them to me. We'll see if they give us an idea of where the cultist will strike next.
Fighting the Earth^64^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Baram Hannikar^Reclamation Rock^Tombs of the Watchful, Scouting the Forest^Scouting Ascension^Kill Black Earth Rock Claws in the Watcher's Forest.^A group of Helmite acolytes left recently to reach the Helm's Hold cathedral, but we have no idea if they've made it there safely. The most we can do for now is to weaken the Black Earth's forces in the hope of drawing their attention away from the acolytes. The backbone of the Black Earth's soldiers are their warriors armed with deadly claws, modeled on that of an Umber Hulk. They call them Rock Claws, and their ferocity has felled many. I would like you to fell many of "them".
Further Vigilance^68^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Riding the Winds^Higher Ground^Complete Vigilance Tasks at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^It's time to hit our next target: Windcall Temple. There the Howling Hatred is summoning air archons from the Elemental Plane of Air to not only serve as soldiers, but to bind into their elemental devices. Their Skyweaver warlocks also summon slaadi from distant Limbo to use as shock troops! Speak with our people here at the Foot of the Heavens and they'll point out tasks at Windcall Temple.Vigilance Tasks are hourly repeatable quests.
Riding the Winds^20^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Twin Breezes^Clearing the Air, Fiends of Limbo, Windbreaker^Collect Lesser Wind Runes from Howling Hatred Cultists around Avia Landing in Spinward Rise, charge them at Elemental Air Shrines located around the edges of the area, then use them to Attune the Lesser Air Obelisk.^The battle plans you discovered allowed us to figure out how the Howling Hatred cultists are using the air obelisks to transport themselves between the floating islands. The cultists carry 'lesser wind runes' inscribed with the symbol of the Howling Hatred. When these wind runes are imbued with elemental air essence, the cultist touches the air obelisk and the air currents carry them to the obelisk on the next island. If you manage to find enough of these wind runes and then charge them at the elemental shrines the cultists have built around Avia Landing, you can use them to attune to the air obelisk. I'll be able to cast a spell to imbue you with the magic necessary to use them!
Holding the Line^64^Councilwoman Callum^Reclamation Rock^Councilwoman Callum^Reclamation Rock^Open Council^Watching the Rock^Speak to Council Members about Vigilance Tasks around Helm's Hold.^Now that you're here, several members of the city council will need your aid to fight against the Cultists occupying our town. Talk to Brother Satarin, Councilman Graves, and Nottin the Hedgewizard. I've had them organize Vigilance Tasks you can do to help battle the Cult of the Black Earth within the walls of Helm's Hold. Of course, you can also continue to help Baram Hannikar and Dassar Truebow. There is much work to be done, and many who can use your aid.
Watching the Rock^20^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^The Verge of Collapse^Toad Bait , In Memorial^Meet with Captain Dunfield in the Memorial Fields.^I'm sorry, <name>, I was a fool to think stabilizing Helm's Hold would force the cultists to retreat. Captain Dunfield insisted we take the fight to them outside the keep, but I wanted to ensure the safety of Helm's Hold and its people. Hopefully we're not too late. Ride out and meet with Captain Dunfield and tell him what happened. We have to hurry before Marlos Urnrayle makes use of his Earth Node and destroys Helm's Hold!
Besieging the Rock^65^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Watching the Rock^Seed of Earth^Complete Vigilance Tasks in the Memorial Hills.^You see it there? The fortress of Reclamation Rock is the stronghold of the Cult of the Black Earth. They created that tower in a single night with their earth magic, thinking that would scare the city into submission while they worked at their vile plans. Our goal is not just to stop them and protect the city, but to show these cultists that they cannot and will never break our resolve to fight them.
Seed of Earth^20^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Black Earth, Stone Heart^^Draw the Seed of Earth from the base of Reclamation Rock in the Memorial Hills and take it to the Tree of Elemental Balance in Protector's Enclave.^My sources tell me that you're on a quest to recover elemental seeds. Our mages have informed me that such a seed was released nearby after your victory over Marlos Urnrayle. Wrench the Elemental Seed from the base of the fortress of Reclamation Rock, then take it back to Protector's Enclave and use it to re-invigorate the Tree of Elemental Balance. We may not see each other for some time after this, <name>. Good luck in your quest.
Warding off Madness^20^Councilman Graves^Reclamation Rock^Councilman Graves^Reclamation Rock^Call to Alms, Recovering Reconstruction^The Verge of Collapse^Gather Materials around Helm's Hold to Reinforce the Wards on Hexabaal.^There is an Aberrant creature called Hexabaal still trapped in our world, but the barriers keeping her contained are beginning to weaken. The last thing we need is an aberration running loose alongside these Black Earth cultists. We need to strengthen the barrier keeping Hexabaal in place. I've got a list here compiled by Hedgewizard Nottin that details what is needed to reinforce the barrier. Can you handle this before Hexabaal is loosed upon this plane?
Voices of Stone^64^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Posting the Truth^Call to Alms, Rocky Foundations^Slay Blackmantle Sorcerers within Helm's Hold.^The Black Earth cult still puts the people of Helm's Hold to work, repairing the fortress so they may use it as their own. We've had to deal with fighting the cultists while also protecting our people... and our faith. The cult's Blackmantle Sorcerers freely walk the streets, spreading their madness whether people want to hear it or not. They're driving people insane, and kill any who challenge their babble. That's not speaking freely, it's forcing their beliefs down people's throats, and I won't stand for it!
Posting the Truth^20^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Adepts of Ascension^Call to Alms, Recovering Reconstruction^Place Posters about Helm's Return around Helm's Hold, defeat Black Earth cultists, then meet with Brother Satarin.^The Cult of the Black Earth are trying to suppress any details about Helm's return and his guardianship over his followers. Baram, Imbross, and I have written several posters detailing Helm's return and his watchfulness over his followers and his land. I want you to place these posters up in Helm's Hold proper, defeat any cultists you run into, then meet with Brother Satarin in the Cathedral with this news. He'll want to know his prayers have been answered. Helm is watching, and if that's not enough, there's a powerful adventurer able to take on the cultists.
Holding the Streets^64^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Warding off Madness, Hedging against Plague^The Verge of Collapse^Defeat Cult of the Black Earth and their allies within Helm's Hold.^The cult's grasp on Helm's Hold is starting to weaken! Now is our chance to take the fight to them in the streets and show the people that it's time to rise up and kick these cultists out of our home. Patrol the streets and defeat any cultists that attack you. The people have been seeing all of your hard work, this will be our last big display to help push the cultists out of our city.
Rock Tumbler^64^Councilman Graves^Reclamation Rock^Councilman Graves^Reclamation Rock^Warding off Madness, Hedging against Plague^The Verge of Collapse^Kill Galeb Duhr in Helm's Hold.^The Cult loves to summon those small rock men, the Galeb Duhr. They often use them as spies, sending them to disguise themselves as rocks and listen to people. When people always think someone is listening, they grow afraid. Let's battle that fear by taking out some of those creatures.
Rocky Foundations^64^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Voices of Stone, Recovering Reconstruction^Rescue Mission^Kill Earth Elementals and Archons in Helm's Hold.^The cult is using the presence of their elementals and archons to bully people into worshipping Ogrémoch, the Prince of Evil Earth. We can't back down now, <name>. I want you to destroy these creatures and show the cultists that the might of Helm is stronger than their mad prince.
The Verge of Collapse^20^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Hedging against Plague, Warding off Madness^Watching the Rock^Defuse the Alchemical Bombs in the Underlift.^We have a problem, <name>. The Black Earth cultists have noticed our efforts to stabilize Helm's Hold and are taking... "extreme" measures to send a message. The workers repairing the sewers report that strange magical devices have been placed in the tunnels of the Underlift. From their reports, these magic items have the ability to cast a powerful 'shatter' spell. The cultists intend to use this to destroy Helm's cathedral! I'm sure they mean to send the message that Helm is weak. Show them that they're wrong.
Rescue Mission^64^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Brother Satarin^Reclamation Rock^Call to Alms, Rocky Foundations^Warding off Madness, Hedging against Plague^Rescue the Workers held captive in the Underlift.^The cultists have many of our townsfolk working to repair the sewers. However, we received word that they've decided to take a few captive, not that they "weren't" already captive, and plan on executing them as an example of what happens when you go against the cult. Please, <name>, you must get to the sewers and prevent the cultists from killing any townsfolk!
Call to Alms^20^Councilman Graves^Reclamation Rock^Councilman Graves^Reclamation Rock^Posting the Truth^Hedging against Plague, Warding off Madness^Recover Stolen Alms for the Poor in Helm's Hold.^A squad of those Black Earth cultists robbed a caravan filled with supplies for the city's needy. They've stolen food and medicine meant for the sick and the poor, and have spread it out among themselves. How do they expect us to do their bidding if we're all starving? We will never be able to get it all back, but if you can recover some and give it to the less fortunate around the city, it would be a great help.
Recovering Reconstruction^20^Councilwoman Callum^Reclamation Rock^Councilwoman Callum^Reclamation Rock^Posting the Truth^Hedging against Plague, Warding off Madness^Recover stolen Construction Supplies and then help with some Reconstruction in Helm's Hold.^The cultists are forcing the people of Helm's Hold to continue our reconstruction of the keep. Brother Satarin says it is because they wish to use us as a fortress. That makes sense, but what doesn't is that the cultists are also stealing supplies from the workers, making their task even harder. Can you recover construction supplies from the cultists, then help our workers with some of the reconstruction? We're going to kick these cultists out, and when we do, I want Helm's Hold to be even more glorious than it once was.
Hedging against Plague^64^Councilwoman Callum^Reclamation Rock^Councilwoman Callum^Reclamation Rock^Call to Alms, Recovering Reconstruction^The Verge of Collapse^Recover Plague Research Notes from cultists in Helm's Hold^Helm's Hold was once a refuge for those affected by the spellplague. I've been working with the archmage Quorthon to find a more permanent cure for these poor souls.  Unfortunately, the latest package of notes he sent me were intercepted by the cultists. Could you "persuade" some of them to give me back that research? It's for a good cause, so I'm sure they'll be reasonable.
Black Earth, Stone Heart^20^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Stolen Mementos , Stone by Stone^Seed of Earth^Destroy Ceremonial Supplies and defeat Marlos Urnrayle in the Lost Tomb.^Our soldiers have uncovered the location of Urnrayle's Earth Node. You can reach it through one of the old crypts nearby. Be warned, <name>. We have reports that the Black Earth are performing a ritual to empower the Earth Node. Our mages believe that the ritual will trigger a massive earthquake that could bring down all of Helm's Hold! You must hurry and stop these rituals and put an end to Marlos Urnrayle, once and for all.
Stay of Execution^65^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^^^Rescue the Captives before they are sacrificed in the Lost Crypt.^The crazed minions of the Cult of the Black Earth have been dragging their captives away to the Lost Crypt. It seems they intend to sacrifice these poor souls to sate their foul appetites. We cannot allow that to happen.
Stolen Memories (Helm's Hold)^65^Brother Theodosian^Reclamation Rock^Brother Theodosian^Reclamation Rock^^^Kill cultists to recover stolen Mementos^The Cult of the Black Earth have taken to keeping mementos stolen from graves and tombs. Small trinkets of no tactical use, but of immense emotional value to all who fought against the Ashmadai. Recovering these mementos will be a great morale booster for all, and might discourage such trophy-taking in future.
Toadkiller^65^Brother Theodosian^Reclamation Rock^Brother Theodosian^Reclamation Rock^Stolen Mementos, Landshark^Black Earth, Stone Heart^Slay Slaadi in the Memorial Hills^Elementals were bad enough, but the slaadi are "sick". They reproduce by implanting "eggs" beneath their victim's skin, which grows into a slaad that eats the host from within. We cannot allow these creatures to defile our soldiers. If they were not deterred by their portals being closed, we will have to go with a more base option. Go, hunt the slaadi, and kill them.
Toad Bait^20^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Watching the Rock^Delaying Ascension^Close the Portals the Slaadi are coming from.^We must be close to Urnrayle's hideout. The cult is getting desperate, throwing elementals, gorgons, and now "slaadi" at us. I want you to attack the slaadi directly at their source. There are several portals that are acting as a gateway between our world and the slaadi's. Destroy the portals and you'll help redirect the cult's attention away from my soldiers.
In Memorial^20^Brother Theodosian^Reclamation Rock^Brother Theodosian^Reclamation Rock^Watching the Rock^Delaying Ascension^Check on the sanctity of Graves in the Memorial Hills.^The Cult of the Black Earth cares nothing for the honor of our dead, and have been seen digging up graves and opening tombs to look for treasure. Our soldiers have been demoralized seeing the cult wield weapons of our fallen brethren. Help us out by ensuring the graves in Memorial Hills remain undisturbed.
By the Horns^65^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Watching the Rock^Toad Bait, Taking Measures^Kill Gorgons in the Memorial Hills^Our soldiers tell tales of horrific monsters called gorgons being tamed and used by the Black Earth cult. These terrible creatures can petrifiy someone with their "breath". We've lost too many men and women to them... soldiers who carried valuable information about the whereabouts of Marlos Urnrayle. Slay these creatures so that my soldiers can continue their work.
Landshark^65^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^Delaying Ascension^Toadkiller, Stone by Stone^Kill Bulettes in the Memorial Hills^Among the many earth-dwelling monsters in the cult's arsenal, few spread as much terror as the Bulette, or "landshark". So long as the cult controls these creatures, no one is safe. Thus, eliminating them must be a top priority.
Taking Measures^65^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^By the Horns, In Memorial^Delaying Ascension^Take Damage from Black Earth Cultists or Slaadi in the Memorial Hills.^No offense, but we can't be constantly relying on adventurers to solve our problems, which is why I want you to help us "learn" to fight the cultists. You're a remarkably tough individual, so I am going to ask you to take damage from their attacks. We will have a mage scrying you to learn all we can, but we can only keep the spell going for a few minutes, so you'll have a time limit.
Stone by Stone^20^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^Delaying Ascension^Black Earth, Stone Heart^Kill Blackmantle Generals in the Memorial Fields.^The generals of the Black Earth, dubbed "Blackmantle Generals", are starting to mobilize to try to destroy our forces before we can discover the location of Urnrayle's Earth Node. Take out their Blackmantle Generals and we'll buy our troops time to get the information we need.
Bannermen Forever!^65^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^Captain Lynn^Reclamation Rock^^^Raise the Neverwinter Banner and fend of Black Earth Cultists in the Memorial Hills.^The Cult of the Black Earth demands our subjugation, so we must show our defiance. Take up the Neverwinter Banner, plant it in full view of Reclamation Rock, and defend it against their forces.
The Fiery Pit^20^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Swords for Everyone!^Mushroom Medic, Traitorous Scum, The Gauntlgrym Reports^Speak to Captain Montrose in the Fiery Pit.^The Lords' Alliance recently shipped out to deal with a disturbance in Gauntlgrym. It seems there's another elemental cult: The Cult of the Eternal Flame, causing trouble for the dwarves.  I received a message from the Lords' Alliance requesting any able-bodied adventurers to come to their assistance at once. Go to the Fiery Pit and meet with Captain Montrose.
The Gauntlgrym Reports^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^The Fiery Pit^A Test for Gauntlgrym, Connecting the Dots, The Missing Spy^Read the Mission Reports in the Fiery Pit.^I'm asking all adventurers to read our reports on the situation here in Gauntlgrym. Since this is a delicate operation with many parties involved, we'd like you to understand what you're up against before we send you off to work for us.
Gauntlgrym Briefing^65^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^The Gauntlgrym Reports^The Delzoun Initiative^Prove your knowledge to Captain Montrose in the Fiery Pit.^Look, I know a lof of you adventurers just skim over the reports instead of fully digesting them, so I'd like to reward those of you who do invest the time. Prove to me that you fully understand the reports, and I'll give you a little leg up in the fight ahead.
The Delzoun Initiative^65^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Gauntlgrym Briefing^The Exiled Duergar^Speak to Grogbi Ironbeard in the Fiery Pit.^Now that you're familiar with the area, you should speak with one of our Delzoun-blooded Gauntlgrym allies, Grogbi Ironbeard. He'll be handling your first assignments in the area we've designated as the Mushroom Gardens... rather, your first assignments after the one I just sent you to do. Morninglord, it's been a long night. I don't even know if it is night anymore down here. Anyway, just go see Grogbi.
The Exiled Duergar^65^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^The Delzoun Initiative^Duergar Task Force^Speak to Horath Pegra in the Fiery Pit.^Word's going around that the duergar may share our goal to rid these caverns of the cult. The Lords' Alliance even allowed one of them into the camp, and they aim for us to work with him, after all the grey dwarves have done to us! Worse, some of my Gauntlgrym brothers believe he knows information about the cultists that we do not—they say he's got a spy working for him, feeding him information. You go talk to him, I'm not working with that duergar until he's proven himself. 
Duergar Task Force^65^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^The Exiled Duergar^Filtered Information^Complete Vigilance Tasks within the Mushroom Gardens and the Crystal Fields areas in the Fiery Pit.^Hmm. So it seems like the cultists and the missing artisans may be one and the same. And the duergar may be primarily targetting the cult. Luckily, we have at least one duergar on our side, and it sounds like his spy is working hard to dig up more information on the cult's activities. Well then, we have our work cut out for us. If we wish to finally defeat the Cult of the Eternal Flame, then we must be just as vigilant, if not more so.Vigilance Tasks are hourly repeatable quests.
Filtered Information^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Lights Out, Olgi Fren'Rah^Services Rendered, Tactical Ventilation, Torch Bearer^Speak to Thannis Beke in the Fiery Pit.^Thannis Beke of the Zhentarim has so far not been closely involved in our plans. He claims the Zhentarim have information that would prove useful towards bringing down Vanifer... but I did not want to resort to being in debt to "them". Now, it appears we have no choice. Vanifer is aware of all of our strategies. The Lords' Alliance needs time to step back and form a new plan. In the meantime, see what Thannis Beke and his duergar crony need. Just be careful.
Taking the Forge^66^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Filtered Information^Burning Heart Task Force^Speak to Farah Dahl in the Fiery Pit.^I'll give you a taste of what I'm hearing: The Cult of the Eternal Flame's been poking around the Great Forge. Seems they've got something big going on within. Word is the Lords' Alliance still wants to run the show, so they're grilling me, trying to find out what our duergar friends know, and passing on the information to their hotshot tactician, Farah Dahl. She's gonna be in charge of taking back the Great Forge. Seems like they only need ya until they get what they want, eh? Anyway, you should probably talk to her.
Making the Rounds I^65^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^^^Patrol locations around the Mushroom Gardens and the Crystal Fields in the Fiery Pit and Defeat Enemies in those^We're short on soldiers, so we need somebody to go out to the Mushroom Gardens and the Crystal Fields and help thin out the enemy's ranks again. Patrol to key points and deal with any resistance you meet along the way.
Hostile Neighbors^65^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Saving Our Spy^Quell Hounds, The Missing Spy^Defeat invading Duergar who have shown up in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit.^I've been tasked with trying to suppress the hostiles in the area while we search for more information about our missing spy. Our efforts to discover Aldruk's location are being hampered by the large numbers of duergar within Mushroom Gardens. Can you defeat the duergar who are invading the Mushroom Gardens? We need to give our agents some space while they work on uncovering Aldruk's location.
The Missing Spy^20^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Mushroom Medic, Traitorous Scum, The Gauntlgrym Reports^Lights Out, Olgi Fren'Rah^Find and collect Encrypted Duergar Runes regarding the disappearance of a missing duergar spy in the Crystal Fields in the Fiery Pit.^There are encrypted duergar runes scattered throughout the Crystal Fields. We'll be able to decipher the runes to find out where the cultists are holding our spy, Aldruk Brun'yar. Can you ride out and get the runes? The sooner we get them, the sooner we can rescue Aldruk and find out what he knows.
Burning Sensations^65^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^^^Collect venom from Bloodburn Scorpions in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit and bring it back to Grogbi Ironbeard to be used as a non-lethal poison.^We'd like to capture some of the cultists alive to bring them in for interrogation. One of our usual tactics is to extract the venom from a particular type of scorpion we like to call the bloodburn scorpion. Its venom won't kill you, but it'll make it feel like your blood's burning you from the inside out, so it's an effective non-lethal method of disabling someone. A little goes a long way, so could you bring me back some?
Mushroom Medic^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^The Fiery Pit^A Test for Gauntlgrym, Connecting the Dots, The Missing Spy^Collect Purple Panacea mushrooms in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit.^The Lords' Alliance is facing multiple problems. We've been nearly pushed out of the Fiery Pit, we've lost one of our spies, and we've run out of supplies to treat our injured soldiers. The dwarves used to cultivate all sorts of mushrooms in the gardens nearby. One type in particular, the Purple Panacea, is particularly useful for its medicinal properties. Can you recover some of the mushrooms to treat our soldiers?
Target: Olgi Fren'rah^65^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^^^Defeat the duergar, Olgi Fren'rah in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit.^There's a duergar by the name of Olgi Fren'rah out there, who has been a thorn in our side for as long as I can remember. He takes delight in raiding our city and making off with our supplies. Think you can take him down for us?
Orders for Destruction^65^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^^^Defeat Duergar Demolitionists in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit and bring back any Attack Orders you find.^Something seems strange about the Duergar attacks. Their forces don't seem to be actively marching on us exclusively. I'm willing to bet we could learn something from any messages they may be carrying. The demolitionists are your best bet. They'll be carrying attack orders. I'd like you to defeat the demolitionists and bring those messages back to me so we can learn more.
Geyser Samples^65^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Quell Hounds, The Missing Spy^Lights Out^Collect elemental water samples from Geysers in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit.^Geysers recently sprang up in the Mushroom Gardens. I wonder if it has anything to do with the giant fire scorpion I've seen burrowing around those parts. I believe the geysers are spouting some sort of potent elemental water that we could use to combat the fiery foes we've been battling. Could you confirm this is still the case by taking samples from each geyser?
Connecting the Dots^20^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Mushroom Medic, Traitorous Scum, The Gauntlgrym Reports^Lights Out, Olgi Fren'Rah^Investigate Suspicious Bodies in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit, and report back with your findings.^We have reports of dead cultists throughout the Mushroom Gardens. This is our chance to see if they had any important information on them. Investigate the corpses and bring back anything you find. It could be a lead towards our missing spy, Aldruk.
Rescuing the Spy^65^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^^^Free Miners and Aldruk in the Excavated Tomb in the Fiery Pit.^The Cult of the Eternal Flame is trying to improve access to the elemental fire node they built beneath Gauntlgrym. They have discovered a collapsed Delzoun tomb beneath the city that runs close to the node and have enslaved a number of Dwarf and Duergar miners to expand their tunnels. Rumors from a few who have managed to escape indicate that the Cult's progress has been slowed by encountering a powerful source of elemental water. The evidence also suggests the Cult has taken Aldruk there for interrogation. I'd like you to rescue Aldruk and release the miners. The escapees indicated that Aldruk was being guarded by an elite type of Razerblast called an Inferno. Watch your step!
Water Brigade^65^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^^^Steal elemental water barrrels from the Excavated Tomb in the Fiery Pit.^My sources tell me that the Cult's progress toward the elemental fire node has been slowed by the discovery of an elemental fountain. The Cultists are unsure of the source of the fountain's elemental water and fear accidentally unearthing it. If the tomb flooded with elemental water, all of their work would be for nothing. We don't have the resources to find the fountain's source, but if we could get a few barrels of that water out of there, I'm sure we could use it to make the Cultists' lives miserable. If you can clear the way I will send some of my associates to do the hauling.
Target: Irestund^65^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^^^Challenge and Defeat the fire giant, Irestund in the Crystal Fields in the Fiery Pit.^The duergar never got along with the fire giants. They're too big and too smart to take as slaves, and they have no qualms about stomping us to dust if they see us. There's one, Irestund, he's called, who won't back down from any challenge, however. Go show him he's better off picking on someone his own size.
Traitorous Scum^20^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^The Fiery Pit^A Test for Gauntlgrym, Connecting the Dots, The Missing Spy^Defeat Duergar Traitors working with the Cult of the Eternal Flame in the Crystal Fields in the Fiery Pit.^If you've noticed, we have several duergar working with the Lords' Alliance. In order to keep their cooperation, we need to meet some of their requests. There are many duergar that chose to work with Vanifer's cult, an act that our allied duergar see as traitorous. They're asking that we make these duergar pay for their treachery, or else they won't provide us with the information we need.
Quell Hounds^65^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Hostile Neighbors, Connecting the Dots^Olgi Fren'Rah, Geyser Samples^Defeat Hell Hounds in the Crystal Fields in the Fiery Pit.^The cultists have been using hell hounds to track all of our movements. As long as they have these hounds, it will be nigh impossible for us to gather intelligence about the cultists. It would greatly help our forces if you could slay these packs of hell hounds in the Crystal Fields.
Crystal Coercion^65^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Mushroom Medic, Burning Sensation^Saving Our Spy^Collect Bloodiron Crystals in the Crystal Fields in the Fiery Pit.^I've got something a bit more pleasant for you to do this time. Are you familiar with Bloodiron Crystals? They're quite plentiful in the nearby Crystal Fields. We could use some of that crystal for a variety of things... as could the cult. Take some of the crystals and bring them back to me. I'll get to work using them to support the alliance.
Protector's Emissary^70^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Lord Neverember.^Welcome, <name>! The Lord Protector has been following your career closely and is impressed by your many efforts to safeguard Neverwinter and the people of the Sword Coast. Lord Neverember would like to speak with you at your earliest convenience.
Commercial Interest^20^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^The Spy Who Backstabbed Me^Barrier to Entry, Slaves to Business^Speak to Lucas Shaneway III in the Fiery Pit.^It's been a real pleasure working with you, <name>, but I believe it's time for me to slip back into the shadows. The Lords' Alliance has assigned one of their pretty boys, Lucas Shaneway III, to head the final assault against Vanifer. Oh, Captain Montrose isn't too happy about it, but they need someone who the cultists can't predict, and that person is Shaneway. Happy hunting.
Making the Rounds II^66^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^^^Patrol locations around the Fallen Halls and the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit and Defeat Enemies in those^We're short on soldiers, so we need somebody to go out to the Fallen Halls and the Great Forge and help thin out the enemy's ranks again. Patrol to key points and deal with any resistance you meet along the way.
Spiker Striker^66^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Hot to Handle, Snuff Out the Flames^Trial By Fire, Controlled Burn^Defeat Flame Spikers in the Fallen Halls in the Fiery Pit.^Vanifer has deployed creatures called "Flame Spikers" into the Fiery Pit. I believe she intends to use them to assault any Zhentarim agents they find skulking in the shadows. I have no love for the Zhentarim, but we must ensure their agents are protected while we work with them.
Services Rendered^20^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Filtered Information^Controlled Burn, Hot to Handle, Target: Singe^Collect Mithril Ingots in the Fallen Halls in the Fiery Pit and bring them back to Thannis Beke in exchange for information.^I know the Fiery Pit is valuable to all of us, but you see, the Zhentarim are risking a lot by providing their services to you here in this dangerous place. Therefore, I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for my services. When the dwarves vacated this area in a hurry, they surely left some mithril ingots behind. After all, they couldn't have missed them too much if they couldn't be bothered to bring them along. Bring me some of those as payment, and we'll talk.
Target: Flamberge^66^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^^^Challenge and Defeat the flame spiker, Flamberge in the Fallen Halls in the Fiery Pit.^I'm going to ask you to go snuff out a big old flame spiker called Flamberge. No questions asked. All you gotta know is that it's big, dumb, and evil. It needs to die, and there's a reward in it for you if you're the one who does it. You in?
Trial By Fire^66^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Target: Singe, Spiker Striker^The Spy Who Backstabbed Me^Test a Lords' Alliance Fire-Resistant substance by withstanding attacks from Fire Cultists and their Allies in the Fallen Halls in the Fiery Pit.^We have a magic spell that is supposed to lessen damage taken from fire elements. This spell was made using components that are easy to obtain, but it runs the risk of not being very effective. I can use a scroll to cast the spell on you. Would you mind testing it out by taking damage from any member of the cult or their allies?
Controlled Burn^20^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Services Rendered, Tactical Ventilation, Torch Bearer^The Spy Who Backstabbed Me^In the Fallen Halls in the Fiery Pit, collect Encoded Scrolls from Cultists, then burn them in Elemental Braziers.^Our agents have found that the cultists are using special encoded runic messages that can only be read when burned in elemental fire.  The scrolls are being carried by various members of the cult. Get as many scrolls as you can, then burn the scrolls in a specific brazier. I'll mark its location for you. When you're done, make sure to note what runes appear. These may be our key to finding Aldruk. Once he's out of the picture, we can move forward with our plans to stop Vanifer.
The Searing Sentinels^65^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Filtered Information^Tactical Ventilation, Torch Bearer^Defeat Fire Giant Guards protecting the Cult of the Eternal Flame near the Fallen Halls in the Fiery Pit.^<name>. I am Horath Pegra. You may think I am untrustworthy like my duergar brethren, Aldruk. That may have been true before this, but Vanifer's cult threatens us all... and I won't be purchased as easily as Aldruk was. The Zhentarim need help locating Aldruk and stopping the cult from releasing Maegera. Our biggest obstacles are the fire giant guards that Vanifer has keeping watch throughout the Fiery Pit. Defeat the fire giant guards and we'll see what information the Zhentarim can retrieve.
Snuff Out the Flames^66^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^What the Blazes?^Target: Singe, Spiker Striker^Defeat Fire Archons summoned by the Cult of the Eternal Flame near the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit.^Lucky for us, I never trusted Aldruk in the first place. I fed the duergar false information about my plans... which means you and I can continue to work together. As you're aware, the Cult of the Eternal Flame is occupying the Great Forge. They have constructed their Elemental Node well beneath the forge, and have been using it to summon forth Fire Archons to defend their position. We need to snuff out as many of the elementals in the Great Forge area as possible, so we can begin to think about mounting a counter-attack. I hope you can handle this and not get burnt to a crisp in the process.
Tactical Ventilation^20^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Filtered Information^Controlled Burn, Hot to Handle, Target: Singe^Close Forge Vents to stifle the air to the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit.^There can be no fire without air. We can force the cultists to move their mining operations if we can get rid of the fresh air reaching them. The Zhentarim have identified several vents that are feeding air to the miners below. Shut the vents off and they'll be forced to move their operations... an action that will make it very easy for us to track them.
Torch Bearer^20^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Filtered Information^Controlled Burn, Hot to Handle, Target: Singe^Collect Iron Torches from Eternal Flame Cultists near the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit.^We've seen the cultists carrying magical torches into the Great Forge. They're using them towards some end, most likely to help in the freeing of Maegera. I want you to recover several of these torches. We'll have our best Zhentarim mages investigate a counterspell to ruin the cult's day the next time they try to use these torches.
Target: Singe^20^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Services Rendered, Tactical Ventilation, Torch Bearer^The Spy Who Backstabbed Me^Challenge and Defeat the fire archon, Singe in the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit.^One of the fire archons in particular has been causing the Zhentarim trouble. Repeated attempts to take it down have all resulted in forced retreat. They're calling it Singe. Thannis needs it dealt with if his men are going to gather any further information about Vanifer.
Hot to Handle^20^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Horath Pegra^Fiery Pit^Services Rendered, Tactical Ventilation, Torch Bearer^The Spy Who Backstabbed Me^Collect Fire Archon Armor and dump it into a well near the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit.^The cultists have been summoning fire archons and using valuable resources to keep them armored. Every time an archon is killed, one of the cultists recovers their armor to re-use. Let's put a dent in those resources by reclaiming some of that armor. When you defeat an archon, take its armor, and douse it in one of the wells near the forge. It'll be hot, so I hope you brought gloves!
The Burning Heart^66^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^^^Extinguish Elemental Blazes in the Burning Heart in the Fiery Pit.^The Cult of the Elemental Flame refuses to give up on tapping the Burning Heart. I've been told that they are running it so hot that the stone of the catacombs itself is beginning to burn. The Cultists appear to be immune to these flames. These elemental blazes need to be extinguished before the Cult can gain any more power from them. The duergar spy, Aldruk, has smuggled some Elemental Water into the Burning Heart catacomb. Fill some buckets when you enter and use them to extinguish the blazes. Then you should attempt to extinguish the Burning Heart.
What the Blazes?^66^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Tactical Ventilation, Torch Bearer^Hot to Handle, Snuff Out the Flames^Extinguish Elemental Blazes in the Burning Heart in the Fiery Pit.^While you've been out, my agents have gotten word of cult activity in a place called the Burning Heart. I've been told that they are running it so hot that the stone of the catacombs itself is beginning to burn.  The cultists appear to be immune to these flames. These elemental blazes need to be extinguished before the cult can gain any more power from them. After all, it'd be bad for business if the cult gained any further ground in awakening the fire primordial sleeping beneath Gauntlgrym.
Seed of Fire^20^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Ring of Fire, Target: Nuria Pyrellis^^Draw the Seed of Fire from the Great Forge in the Fiery Pit and take it to the Tree of Elemental Balance in Protector's Enclave.^My scouts reported an odd seed-looking object appearing after you defeated Vanifer. I don't know much about nature, but I have heard about you working with that pleasant druid in Protector's Enclave. If you go to the Great Forge, you should be able to draw the seed from the Elemental Altar. Once you have it, bring it back to the Tree of Elemental Balance in Protector's Enclave.
Making the Rounds III^67^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^^^Patrol locations around the Merchant District and the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit and Defeat Enemies in those^We're short on soldiers, so we need somebody to go out to the Merchant District and the Water Pumps and help thin out the enemy's ranks again. Patrol to key points and deal with any resistance you meet along the way.
Sabotage^67^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Pillage First, Barrier to Entry^Angry Waters^Defeat Cultist Saboteurs trying to sabotage pipes near the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit.^The cultists are clever, I'll admit. They know that it's only a matter of time before we finish them off, but they're taking advantage of the fact that we can't be everywhere at once. While the cultists inside the pumps work to figure out the mechanism, and coerce the dwarves into divulging their secrets, they have sent some cultists out to sabotage the pipes, knowing we will need to stop them before mounting our attack. Luckily, we have you.
Brute Squad^67^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Financial Tracking, Slaves to Business^Target: Nuria Pyrellis, Cache on Delivery^Defeat Magma Brutes near the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit.^The Cult of the Eternal Flame have brought forth huge magma brutes to do their bidding. If someone doesn't stop these huge monstrosities from rampaging through the area near Gauntlgrym's water pumps, there won't be much left worth saving. Get over to the water pumps and destroy these brutes.
Saddle Down^67^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Financial Tracking, Slaves to Business^Target: Nuria Pyrellis, Cache on Delivery^Collect Fire Strider Saddles from riders near the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit.^Have you seen the beasts the cultists are using as mounts? They're called Fire Striders. They're fast, and they're well-suited for this environment. I've sent some of my soldiers off to capture them and work on training them so we can match the cultists in battle, but there's one thing we're missing: saddles. Luckily, the cultists have brought plenty, as long as someone's willing to take them by force.
Target: Captain Felcrest^67^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^^^Challenge and defeat the cultist strider rider, Captain Felcrest near the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit.^There's word that a traitor to the Lords' Alliance rides with the enemy. Captain Felcrest was once a distinguished officer within the Lords' Alliance, but abandoned his post several years ago and slaughtered several good men on his way out. Find him, challenge him, and bring him to justice.
The Plumbing Job^67^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^^^Patch up leaky Broken Pipes near the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit.^Looks like the cultist sabotuers were able to complete some of their work before you arrived. The pipes have started to leak, and the problem will only get worse the longer we leave it alone. I know it's not the most glamorous adventure for you, but we need someone who can handle themselves in a fight to go back to Water Pumps and repair those pipes. Cultists will most certainly be skulking about there still. The dwarves have given us a substance much like sovereign glue which can fill in the cracks. Use that on the pipes.
The Cistern^67^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^^^Prevent Vanifer from Waking Maegera in the Cistern in the Fiery Pit.^Ironically, Vanifer and her fire cultists must go to a place strongly influenced by water, the Cistern. The Cistern is a place where the  dwarves summon the water elementals used to keep Maegera slumbering. The pumps' mechanism can only be operated by a dwarf of the Delzoun bloodline, and it so happens that Vanifer has kidnapped a number of the dwarves who were foolish enough to return to their homes and businesses. If the supply of elementals should be stopped, Maegera would awake with tragic consequences. Stop Vanifer!
Ring of Fire^20^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Financial Tracking, Cache on Delivery^Seed of Fire^Defeat Vanifer in the Cistern in the Fiery Pit.^My plan worked! Of course it did... I never doubted myself for a moment. Vanifer is hiding, I assume "cowering", in the Cistern, of all places. We've got her backed into a corner, so it should be a simple matter of dispatching her now, especially with our troops armed and ready. Go to the Cistern and bring an end to this whole mess. This heat is wreaking havoc on my hair!
Financial Tracking^20^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Barrier to Entry, Slaves to Business^Ring of Fire, Target: Nuria Pyrellis^Hide enchanted coins in cultist Supply Crates in the Merchant District in the Fiery Pit.^If you know anything about me, it's that I always finish the job. In this case, I want to make sure to track down each and every last Eternal Flame cultist and bring them to justice.  The cultists have supplies in the Merchant District. Go there, and plant these enchanted coins in their supplies. We'll be working with the Harpers to trace those coins back to wherever the cultists end up bringing them, even if they get away.
Target: Nuria Pyrellis^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Financial Tracking, Cache on Delivery^Seed of Fire^Challenge and defeat the cultist Flamewrath, Nuria Pyrellis in the Merchant District in the Fiery Pit.^A cultist named Nuria Pyrellis has been killing our soldiers left and right. The cultists look to her as a champion of sorts, and my soldiers fear her as an unstoppable beast. If we're going to assault Vanifer, we'll need to defeat Nuria Pyrellis.
Slaves to Business^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Commercial Interest^Financial Tracking, Cache on Delivery^Rescue captured Dwarven Prisoners from cultists in the Merchant District in the Fiery Pit.^Unbelievable... to be working beneath Shaneway! The man spends as much time admiring his hair as he does strategizing! I digress... we have a job to do. A group of rather foolhardy dwarves has tried sneaking back to their businesses in the Merchant District to retrieve some of their valuable stock. Lucky for them, the cultists seem uninterested in the valuables, but they did seem quite interested in taking the dwarves prisoner when caught. It's now our duty to save them.
Cache on Delivery^20^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Barrier to Entry, Slaves to Business^Ring of Fire, Target: Nuria Pyrellis^Dig up hidden dwarven Equipment Caches in the Merchant District in the Fiery Pit, and bring them back to Lucas Shaneway III.^Ah, good, Farah received word from my messenger! Bad news. We're running low on supplies. This battle has been tough on our equipment, and it being so far underground, our supply lines are tight.  As luck would have it, that Ironbeard fellow tells me there are hidden caches of equipment in the Merchant District. Could you investigate this and come back with any equipment you find?
Pillage First^67^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Farah Dahl^Fiery Pit^Commercial Interest^Sabotage, Never Betray a Lord^Defeat Cultists who are pillaging the Merchant District in the Fiery Pit.^Good to know you're back to working with the Lords' Alliance, eh? Let's get started. Shaneway wants us to focus our efforts on the Merchant District. He's dealing with getting the doors to all the stores sealed, while I'm tasked with defeating the cultists trying to get into the stores. We need you to strike down these pillagers. Vanifer's army is running low on resources... we must prevent them from getting more.
Barrier to Entry^20^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Commercial Interest^Financial Tracking, Cache on Delivery^Activate magical barriers on Doors in the Merchant District in the Fiery Pit.^When the cultists attacked, the dwarven merchants had to close up shop in a hurry. Unfortunately, Vanifer and her cultists are trying to rob these stores of "quite" valuable merchandise. They're not going after necklaces or rings, they're after magical items. Swords coated in flames, spears dipped in acid, all sorts of things to ruin our day. Take this enchanted ring and conjure up magical barriers to seal the doors. At least then we'll stop the flow of magical goods going to the cultists.
Trouble on the Winds^20^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Swords for Everyone!^Skyward War^Talk to Marshal Rhaegos in Spinward Rise.^The cults of Elemental Evil has been causing problems around the Sword Coast. The Lords' Alliance and the other Sword Coast factions have been doing their best to deal with these threats.  However, there's a new battlefront. Harper spies have discovered a new cult stronghold in the unlikeliest of places: in the skies above Neverwinter Wood! Spinward Rise is a set of islands held aloft by cloud giant magic. It has become the base for the Cult of the Howling Hatred, another sect of Elemental Evil. Our allies have managed to establish a beachhead on the lowest island of Spinward Rise. But they need your help! Meet with Marshal Rhaegos there as soon as you can.
War in the Heavens^67^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Trouble on the Winds^Eternal Vigilance^Meet Brokar Ironshod of the Riders of the West Wind, Harper Evandriel of the Harpers, Pirri the Swift of the Zhentarim, Skreel Swiftwing of the Sharptalon Flight, and Druid Okobo of the Emerald Enclave at the Foot of the Heavens in Spinward Rise.^We've have been tracking the movements of the elemental cults since their "beacons" started appearing around the Sword Coast. The devastation that happened at the Drowned Shore was the first indication of their evil intent. While we were able to mobilize forces against the water, earth, and fire cults, it wasn't until recently that we found where the air cult was based. We've gathered together people who would oppose the Cult of the Howling Hatred before they bring more destruction to our lands. They would like to speak with you as soon as you are able.
Eternal Vigilance^67^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^War in the Heavens^Riding the Winds^Complete Vigilance Tasks at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Our first target is Avia Landing.  The Cult of the Howling Hatred has established a barracks, training grounds, and dock there where they bring in fresh recruits and supplies via elemental air balloons. There's also an area where their kenku allies have established a camp.<br>Talk with the other people around our base camp at the Foot of the Heavens. They'll provide you with tasks around Avia Landing. Return to me when you're done.<br>Vigilance Tasks are hourly repeatable quests.Vigilance Tasks are hourly repeatable quests.
Howling Hatred^67^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat Howling Hatred Cultists around Spinward Rise.^Those who serve the Howling Hatred are insane and dangerous. Their purpose in life is to bring about a world torn apart by raging storms and destructive hurricanes. We cannot allow this to happen. We must reduce their numbers before this madness spreads. Take on the Howling Hatred Cultists where you can find them around Spinward Rise.
Avia Landing: Flightless Fury^67^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat an Owlbear and Axebeaks around Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^So... I don't want to call this a personal vendetta... except it is. You see, when you do as much traveling as my fellow clerics and I, you're bound to run into some fearsome beasties wanting to eat you. Well, in my case, it was a herd of axebeaks! They came in out of nowhere and thought I'd be tasty. By Shaundakul's grace, I managed to outrun them, but not without a whole lot of grief! Oh, I was also mauled by an owlbear as a child. I don't want to talk about it. You'll find these beasties on the edges of Avia Landing. Avenge me!
Avia Landing: Lesser Wind Runes^67^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^^^Collect Lesser Wind Runes from Howling Hatred Cultists around Avia Landing in Spinward Rise, then charge them at Elemental Air Shrines located on the edges of the area.^Hey there, young one! Some of the Howling Hatred cultists possess 'lesser wind runes' they take empower at four shrines located around Avia Landing. We'd like to study these further. Collect lesser wind runes from cultists and then charge them at the elemental shrines the cultists have built around Avia Landing.
Avia Landing: Air Supply^67^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Sabotage the Air Balloons and Cult Supplies at the Balloon Docks at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred is bringing in new recruits and supplies to Spinward Rise via their balloon docks at Avia Landing. This is a prime target for sabotage. Our spies tell us the supplies carry volatile alchemical reagants, which can be ignited. Likewise, from what we learned of elemental air devices, the balloons contain air elementals which can be released. Head over to the balloon docks, and start sabotaging the supplies and balloons!
Avia Landing: Twin Breezes^67^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Recover Cult Battle Plans and defeat Dashar and Silviria in the Air Cult Barracks located at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^We believe we have located two of the key leaders in the Cult of the Howling Hatred. Dashar and Silviria are twin genasi who are responsible for establishing the cult training grounds on Avia Landing and the training of new recruits. We believe the twins are located at the Air Cult Barracks on Avia Landing. While you're there, please search the building to see if you can find any cult battle plans. It's always better if we can stay ahead of the game.
Avia Landing: Tome of Air^67^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Obtain the Lesser Auran Tome by navigating the earth motes over the Air Cult Roost at Avia landing in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred possesses particular knowledge of elemental air magic. Learning more about it would be a boon to our Harper wizards in our fight against the cult. Our spies have learned the cultists keep a magical book called the Lesser Auran Tome on an earth mote over the Air Cult Roost on Avia Landing. Find the glider tower that will get you to the nearest earth mote, then use it to leap between the motes to get to the tome. Be careful!
Avia Landing: Learning to Fly^67^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Steal Elemental Air Devices and defeat Howling Hatred Cultists at the Glider Towers at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred is using strange devices to harness the power of elemental air. Such things are quite dangerous in the hands of the cultists, but with careful study we might be able to discern ways to fight our enemies. We'd like you to acquire some of these elemental air devices for study. Our spies have seen the cultists practicing with these devices by the Glider Towers at Avia Landing. Head there, take out some cultists, and bring back some of those devices!
Avia Landing: Kenku^67^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat Kenku at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise. They are mainly found at the Kenku Camp and in Foulclaw Wood.^(Screech!)Kenku make problems. Kenku steal weapons, supplies. Kenku kill our soldiers! Earth-bound go to Avia Landing. Kill kenku!
Avia Landing: Birds of a Feather^67^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Rescue Kenku Eggs from Foulclaw Woods at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Kenku cursed! Kenku bird-creatures, but cannot fly. Kenku earth-bound, like you. Scratch in dirt. Very sad. Some kenku join Howling Hatred, hoping to fly again! Other kenku saw evil of cult and refused to join. But evil kenku stole eggs from good kenku! Good kenku want eggs back! We help good kenku! Go to Foulclaw Woods, rescue eggs from evil kenku!
Avia Landing: Shiny Metal^67^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat Kenku and recover Stolen Weapons from the Kenku Camp at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^(Screech!)We ask for help, earth-bound! We aarakocra build good weapons. Strong! Light! Good to carry in flight. Shiny too! Cultists have bird-friends too. But they not warriors. They sneak-thieves! They steal our weapons when aarakocra not looking. Now our weapons almost gone. Soon we fight only with talons and beaks! You help aarakocra! Find kenku bird-houses. Punish them for theft! Bring back weapons to us! Then we fight evil air together!
Avia Landing: Fight the Wind^67^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat Air Archons and defeat Dashar and Silviria in the Air Cult Barracks located at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^(Skreech!)Earth-bound! Air archons serving elemental prince Yan-C-Bin evil! Plan destruction with Howling Hatred leaders! You stop evil plans! Go to Air Cult Barracks. Defeat air archons and cult leaders!
Avia Landing: Target - North Wind^67^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat North Wind at the Air Cult Roost at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Ready for a target? There's a member of the Howling Hatred known as North Wind. He helped establish Spinward Rise as a "peaceful observatory of the stars" before the truth came out. He still uses those same lies to recruit new members. For those reasons, he needs to be eliminated.
Avia Landing: Target - Blackfeather^67^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^^^Kill Blackfeather in Foulclaw Woods at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Kenku are filthy animals, sneaking and stealing any scraps they can get hold of. There is one that's worse than the rest. Blackfeather has taken to assassinating people of our alliance. That will not do. Think of this as a... counter-assassination.
Final Vigilance^68^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Higher Ground^Seed of Air^Complete Vigilance Tasks at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^You've done great work at Windcall Temple. But now we must turn our sights to Thunderhead Reach. There, the mighty cloud giants work with the Cult of the Howling Hatred to create devastation orbs to rain down destruction upon their targets far beneath us. They must be stopped before it's too late! Speak with our people here at the Foot of the Heavens and they'll point out tasks at Thunderhead Reach.Vigilance Tasks are hourly repeatable quests.
Scrying the Skies^20^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^War Chests, Whispers on the Wind, Giantslayer^Tempest in a Bottle^Use the Far-Scryers located around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The Harpers and the Zhentarim have been working on deciphering various cult messages. There seems to be numerous references to the "Far-scryers" in Thunderhead Reach, although we're not sure why.  If you can go to Thunderhead Reach and examine the Far-Scryers, we can get a better idea of what they're talking about.
Higher Ground^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Feeding the Slaadi^War Chests, Whispers on the Wind, Giantslayer^Collect Greater Wind Runes from Howling Hatred Cultists around Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise, charge them at Elemental Air Shrines located around the edges of the area there, then use them to Attune the Greater Air Obelisk.^Brokar Iroshod has deciphered the Greater Air Obelisk! This one requires different wind runes designed to hold more elemental power. Head to Windcall Temple and search the Howling Hatred cultists. Some will possess greater wind runes. Once again, charge them at the Elemental Shrines found there, attune them at the Greater Air Obelisk, then return to me.
Seed of Air^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Tempest in a Bottle^^Draw the Seed of Air from the Tempest Bridge at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise and take it to the Tree of Elemental Balance in Protector's Enclave.^Druid Okobo has informed me that you have weakened the elemental air node enough to draw forth an elemental seed of air!  She says the seed is located near Tempest Bridge at Thunderhead Reach. Take the seed back to Protector's Enclave and use it to re-invigorate the Tree of Elemental Balance!
Windcall Temple: Greater Wind Runes^68^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^^^Collect Greater Wind Runes from Howling Hatred Cultists around Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise, then charge them at Elemental Air Shrines located there.^My friend! Just like the lesser wind runes of Avia Landing, the cultists of Windcall Temple carry greater wind runes. We'd like you to bring some of these new runes for us for study. Find more of the greater wind runes and then charge them at the elemental shrines the cultists have built around Windcall Temple.
Windcall Temple: Clearing the Air^68^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Add Cleansing Incense to the Altar Braziers at the Altar of Yan-C-Bin at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^Near the highest point of Windcall Temple, there is an altar. It is here that the Howling Hatred Cultists worship Yan-C-Bin, the Elemental Prince of Evil Air. Yan-C-Bin does not care for worship, but the altar does act as a ritual focal point for gathering elemental air essence. If disrupted, it breaks the cultists' connection with the Elemental Plane of Air. Take this cleansing incense and go to the Altar of Yan-C-Bin. Add the incense to the braziers that burn there, cleansing the air of corrupted elemental energies.  Be careful though: the Howling Hatred is protective of their altar to Yan-C-Bin.
Windcall Temple: Greater Tome of Air^67^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Obtain the Greater Auran Tome by navigating the earth motes over the Binding Workshops and the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred possesses particular knowledge of elemental air magic. Learning more about it would be a boon to our Harper wizards in our fight against the cult. Our spies have learned the cultists keep a magical book called the Greater Auran Tome on a earth mote over the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple. Find the glider tower that will get you to the nearest earth mote, then use it to leap between the motes to get to the tome. Be careful!
Windcall Temple: Slaad Summoner^68^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Close the Limbo Portals and defeat Thurl Merosska in the Howling Maw located at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^After the defeat of the slaadi at Reclamation Rock, the air cultists have decided to be more cautious with their summoning of the creatures. But now we have found the source of the slaadi in Spinward Rise! Led by Thurl Merosska, the Howling Hatred cultists have carved out tunnels in Windcall Temple and constructed portals to summon the slaadi from limbo. Head to Windcall Temple, destroy the portals, and defeat Thurl Merosska!
Thunderhead Reach: Grand Tome of Air^69^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Obtain the Grand Auran Tome by navigating the earth motes over the Nimbus Courtyard at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred possesses particular knowledge of elemental air magic. Learning more about it would be a boon to our Harper wizards in our fight against the cult. Our spies have learned the cultists keep a magical book called the Grand Auran Tome on a earth mote over Nimbus Courtyard at Thunderhead Reach. Find the tower that will get you to the nearest earth mote, then use it to leap between the motes to get to the tome. Be careful!
Thunderhead Reach: Eyes in the Sky^69^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Gather Intelligence Reports from Howling Hatred Cultists around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^We've managed to decipher the messages used by the Cult of the Howling Hatred, so they've become much more cautious on who they send them with. If we can get hold of this information, we can stay ahead of the cult. Head to Thunderhead Reach and gather their intelligence reports.
Thunderhead Reach: Tempest in a Bottle^69^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Stop the Devastation Orb Rituals and defeat Cirrus Skyseeker in Nimbus Tower located at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^We know what the Howling Hatred Cultists plan to do: they seek to drop their devastation orbs on targets across the Sword Coast. The destruction and death toll will be catastrophic! Head to Nimbus Tower in Thunderhead Reach. Cloud giants and air cultists under the command of Cirrus Skyseeker are creating the devastation orbs. They must be stopped!
Thunderhead Reach: Whispers on the Wind^69^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Gather Ciphered Messages from Howling Hatred Cultists at the Nimbus Courtyard at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^We know the Howling Hatred must have some greater plans than just summoning and binding elementals into their magical devices. We've seen them gathering with the cloud giants in Thunderhead Reach, and we want to know why. Now that we've invaded Spinward Rise, the Howling Hatred cultists have become very secretive about their plans, passing on information in secret messages. If we manage to get hold of these messages, we might be able to decipher them. Head to Thunderhead Reach and try to find any ciphered messages on Howling Hatred Cultists.
Thunderhead Reach: War Chests^69^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^^^Recover War Chest Treasures from War Chests around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise^To keep the Cult of the Howling Hatred going requires an enormous amount of treasure. They keep these in "war chests" in the upper regions of Spinward Rise. Head to Thunderhead Reach and recover the treasures from these war chests.
Windcall Temple: Windbreaker^68^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^^^Use Black Earth to disrupt Elemental Air Portals at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The Howling Hatred calls to the Elemental Plane of Air, forcing the elementals who dwell there to come to our world. They are then bound by magic into service to the cult by the Skyseer warlocks. The Howling Hatred only seeks to do evil with these elementals. The connection with the Elemental Plane of Air must be broken. I have enchanted a piece of Black Earth to seal the portals. Go to Windcall Temple, and use this Black Earth to disrupt the portals.
Windcall Temple: Archon Anarchy^68^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat Air Archons at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise. They are found near the Elemental Air Portals.^The air archons summoned from the Elemental Plane of Air serve the Cult of the Howling Hatred. This corruption of the pure element of air is a crime against nature. Seek out the air archons of Windcall Temple, and destroy them!
Thunderhead Reach: Archon Anarchy^69^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^^^Defeat Air Archons at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The air archons summoned from the Elemental Plane of Air serve the Cult of the Howling Hatred. This corruption of the pure element of air is a crime against nature. Seek out the air archons of Thunderhead Reach and destroy them!
Thunderhead Reach: Cloud Magic^69^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^^^Collect Air Magic Lore and defeat Cirrus Skyseeker in Nimbus Tower located at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The magic of the cloud giants is strong. Through it they are able to make massive islands and castles float in the skies. In the hands of the Howling Hatred it would be a terrible weapon! We cannot allow the Howling Hatred to possess such knowledge. Seek out and collect air magic lore in the cloud giant stronghold at Nimbus Tower. The Emerald Enclave may be able to use it to counter the evil of the cults.
Thunderhead Reach: Lofty Ideas^69^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^^^Gather Air Magic Scrolls from Cloud Giants around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The knowledge of air magic the cloud giants hold is vast. The Emerald Enclave could learn much from it, and form defenses against the Cult of the Howling Hatred. Head to Thunderhead Reach and seek out the cloud giants who dwell there. Take their air magic scrolls!
Windcall Temple: Unbound Anger^67^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^^^Unleash Bound Air Elementals on their captors at the Binding Workshops at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The Howling Hatred cultists seek to become like the air they worship. They try to bend it to their will, summoning elementals of air and binding them into their magical devices. I hear the howling rage of these elementals carried on the wind. Air does not want to be bound, but fly free. It is the nature of air. Go to the binding workshops the cultists use at Windcall Temple. Free the elementals from their binding, and they will seek vengeance on their captors.
Windcall Temple: Order out of Chaos^68^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Gather Slaad Control Gems from Howling Hatred Cultists at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^(Screech!)Earth-bound Evandriel tell Skreel secret of slaadi. Slaadi have shiny stones in brain! Air cult warlocks take stones, control slaadi! You go Windcall Temple. Take shiny stones from air cultists! Cultists no longer control slaadi. Slaadi eat cultists!
Windcall Temple: Fiends of Limbo^68^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Slay Slaadi at the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^(Screech!)Earth-bound! You know slaadi? Slaadi are demons from Limbo! Slaadi live only to kill and destroy. Slaadi nasty, evil things! Howling Hatred warlocks summon slaadi from Limbo. Cult thinks they control slaadi. Slaadi don't care who summons. Slaadi just want to spread chaos! Slaadi are plague upon earth-bound world. Kill slaadi before slaadi kill you!
Windcall Temple: Feeding the Slaadi^67^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Free the Sacrificial Victims and defeat Thurl Merosska in the Howling Maw located at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^(Skreech!)Slaadi come from Limbo with terrible hunger for destruction! They also come with terrible hunger for flesh! Howling Hatred cultists bring victims for slaadi to devour! You must stop them! Go to Howling Maw at Windcall Temple and rescue victims!
Thunderhead Reach: Giantslayer^69^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Slay Cloud Giants at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^(Screech!)Cloud giants come together very rarely. But air prophet very charismatic. She bring together large family of cloud giants together here at Spinward Rise! Cloud giants help Howling Hatred with plans. Stop cloud giants, stop plans. Very simple! You go Thunderhead Reach, stop cloud giants!
Thunderhead Reach: The Cloud Forges^69^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^^^Slay the Cloud Giant Smiths working the forges around Nimbus Courtyard at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^(Screech!)Cloud giants good smiths! Not good like fire giants, but good. Now they make weapons of war to arm the Howling Hatred! Go to forges. Kill cloud giant smiths! No weapons, no war!
Windcall Temple: Target - Glark the Rancid^68^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^^^Kill Glark the Rancid near the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The slaadi are creatures from the dimension of Limbo. They are awful, chaotic creatures, living for death and destruction. Skyseer warlocks have been summoning them at Windcall Temple. Glark the Rancid is a particularly nasty slaad, and has been leading hordes of its kind against allied targets. Glark must be banished back to Limbo before it does more damage. You'll find him near the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple.
Windcall Temple: Target - Windshear^68^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^^^Kill Windshear near the Elemental Portals at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The air archons are militant creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. Many of them serve Yan-C-Bin, the Elemental Prince of Evil Air. Windshear is a higher-ranking air archon, and has led many successful attacks against our allies. Take out Windshear at all costs!
Thunderhead Reach: Target - Rastari^69^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^^^Kill the cloud giant Rastari at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^Rastari is a cloud giant talented with their special brand of air magic. He sometimes uses it to create a fog to disguise the movements of the Howling Hatred cultists. This cannot be allowed to continue. Rastari must be eliminated. Head to Thunderhead Reach and take care of him.
Thunderhead Reach: Target - Grackel^69^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^^^Kill the owlbear Grackel at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^Some beasts are too smart for their own good. A vicious owlbear named Grackel has been trained by the Cult of the Howling Hatred to sniff out our spies. This has to end! Head to Thunderhead Reach and take out Grackel.
Mastering Melee^10^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Garrett Andreas^Protector's Enclave^^^Learn about switching between missile and melee combat from Garrett Andreas in Protector's Enclave.^Word of your skill with the bow is getting around, <name>, so it's no surprise you've attracted the attention of another well-regarded ranger. An old friend of mine, Garrett Andreas, has asked to see you at the earliest opportunity. I believe he wants to teach you a thing or two about melee combat. I've known Garrett for years; he's a good man to have on your side in a fight. Anything he has to say about the art of combat will certainly be worth hearing. You'll find him camped over on the other side of the Temple.
Burn the Supplies^33^Hedgewizard Nottin^Helm's Hold^Hedgewizard Nottin^Helm's Hold^^^Burn the Ashmadai's Summoning Supplies in the Watcher's Forest.^Fighting the Ashmadai's summoners, eh? You know, If you really want to hurt them, you should burn up their summoning supplies. Oh yes, proper summoning requires all manner of special powders and essences. Losing those would hinder the cult's summoning immensely.  They keep those supplies in crates near their summoning circles out in the forest, usually.
Hidden Council^33^Dassar Truebow^Helm's Hold^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^^^Enter the Old Dirty Dwarf Tavern and meet with Councilwoman Callum.^The Ashmadai still control the streets of Helm's Hold and the Monastery itself, but there may be a way to get to them. I've received a message from Councilwoman Alisara Callum. She and several allies are hidden within Helm's Hold. They've heard of your deeds, and wish to meet you. You'll find them in the ... *sigh*... they have set up headquarters in a tavern with a most unfortunate name. It's known as the "Old Dirty Dwarf". You'll find it in the courtyard immediately beyond the Old Gate. Good luck. 
Hell Reaver^34^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^^^Find and defeat Hellfire Magus and Legion Devils within Helm's Hold.^The so-called "Prophet" Rohini is preparing some horrific ritual within the cathedral. While she is occupied, the Ashmadai serve as her eyes and ears on the streets. If we are to strike against Rohini, we must first blind and deafen her. To that end, I need you to slay Hellfire Magus and the Legion Devils who prowl Helm's Hold.
Devilish Injustice^34^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^^^Gather Wanted Posters of innocent citizens, and then deliver them to the merchant Othar Otharson.^The Ashmadai have been declaring innocent people to be criminals, and then executing them in the market. They've just put up a new batch of wanted posters. Tear them down, then go and find a merchant named Othar Otharson. Othar has a copy of the next list of people the Ashmadai plan to hunt down for imagined crimes. If we get that list, we can get those people to safety.
The Being from Beyond^34^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^Councilwoman Callum^Helm's Hold^long chain^The Sanatorium^Summon the creature Hexabaal and learn her secrets.^The adventurers who discovered The Prophet was actually the succubus Rohini spoke of a strange creature that she bound in a summoning circle. The creature is held against its will. No doubt eager to strike back at its captor. That makes it very valuable to us, since it may know Rohini's plans. In order to speak with the creature you must weaken the spell that binds it. A devil cast the spell, so devils hold the key to weakening it. Gather imp wings and place them in the brazier before the summoning circle. That should allow you to speak with the creature.
Leaving the Devil Behind^34^Alisara Callum^Helm's Hold^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^^^Meet with Sergeant Knox in Protector's Enclave.^With Rohini gone and her Ashmadai cultists in disarray, we have a chance to retake Helm's Hold, and we owe it all to you -- and to Sergeant Knox, who chose to send you to our aid in the first place. Speaking of the Sergeant, I'm certain he already has need of your skills elsewhere. You should return to Protector's Enclave.
The Ghost of Grimhollow^8^Melwil Stouthart^Ebon Downs^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^The Haunting of Ebon Downs^Fires of Home, The Pale Shepherds^Find a Selûne's Tear flower and burn them in the Brazier of the Lost to summon the ghost of Galwyn Grist.^When last I saw him, Doomguide Soulhearth asked me about a ritual to summon the ghost of Grimhollow's last mayor, Galwyn Grist. If you were to summon the ghost, he may be able to tell you where the Doomguide went. The ritual is quite simple, all you need do is gather one of the flowers known as Selûne's Tears and burn it in the brazier found amid the ruins of Grist's old home.
Fires of Home^8^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^The Ghost of Grimhollow^The Haunted Doomguide^Light Hearth Fires in Grimhollow's abandoned houses to guide the ghosts back home.^The ghosts of Grimhollow no longer recognize this cold and desolate place. Without a connection to their past lives they are confused and vulnerable. This makes them easy prey for Idris and her minions. Enter the abandoned homes of Grimhollow and re-light the cold hearths found there. Once the home fires are burning the ghosts will remember and be drawn to safety.
The Pale Shepherds^8^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^The Ghost of Grimhollow^The Haunted Doomguide^Slay Wights in the ruined village of Grimhollow.^The necromancer, Idris, is using her hellish powers to enslave the ghosts of Grimhollow for some fiendish purpose. She has sent her wight minions into Grimhollow to drive the ghosts into the marshes for her Soul Slavers. Defeat these wights and help protect the dead.
The Haunted Doomguide^8^Galwyn Grist^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Fires of Home, The Pale Shepherds^Sealing the Crypts, The Scales of Kelemvor^Meet Doomguide Soulhearth at the old Temple of Kelemvor and get his help to stop Idris.^You have done much for us here but to stop Idris you will need to join forces with Doomguide Vesper Soulhearth. You will find him at the old temple of Kelemvor. Tell him what you have done for us, and I am certain he will trust you as I do.
Spider Hunting^36^Sergeant Benton^Ebon Downs^Sergeant Benton^Ebon Downs^^^Hunt down and slay Spiders in the exterior of Ebon downs.^You know, once you get used to the undead, and their smell, they're an easy enough target. Now spiders-  they give me the chills. If you could take out some spiders while adventuring, I'd be able to do my job better. Oh, and let's keep this between us, if you don't mind.
The Scales of Kelemvor^8^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Acolyte Brimn^Ebon Downs^The Haunted Doomguide^The Dread Horde, The Barrow Lords^Enter the Barrow of the Templars and find the Scales of Kelemvor.^There is a set of blessed scales that I believe were buried in the barrow of the Templars here in Silverwisp Swamp. I've tried to get through myself, but have had no luck. These scales may be able to help us in the fight against Idris. Go to the barrow and retrieve the scales. Be wary though, these old barrows are filled with traps, and the newly risen dead.
The Dread Horde^9^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Sealing the Crypts, The Scales of Kelemvor^The Soul Slavers, The Drowned King^Destroy Zombies near the Temple of Kelemvor.^Idris repeatedly sends hordes of undead against the temple in an attempt to destroy us. Even with Kelemvor's aid we have been hard pressed to resist them. And with each assault we repulse we are left with fewer defenders. I'm not sure we can fend off another attack, but if you were to take the fight to the undead we might stand a chance. Hunt down the zombies that gather in the marshes. Each zombie you destroy means one less to join in an attack on the temple.
Lore of the Dead^37^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^^^Read the Inscriptions outside each barrow to learn of the inhabitants of each of the burial mounds.^In order to combat our foes, you should understand them, for they were not always monsters. Before each ancient barrow in the Silverwisp Swamp there stands a stone monolith that tells the story of the chieftain who is buried within. Read these monoliths, for it may be that we can learn something that will aid us in our struggle against Idris.
Breaking the Blackscales^43^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Search and Seizure^^Slay 4 Blackscale Bruisers in the Courtyard.^I was hoping maybe the lizards hadn't moved into the fortress proper, but no dice. I snuck in earlier and managed to look around a bit before I was chased out. It looked like the lizards in the fort are kept in line by a couple of the big blackscales. If the pirates' skyships are still somewhere on the island, this fort is bound to have some kind of clue as to where they are. Probably a bunch of treasure, too. We need to take out the lizards inside the fort, which means we need to take out those blackscales.
The Dead City^44^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^Beneath Skull Fortress^Saving the Living, Blackdagger Buccaneers^Scout ahead to the Skyship Harbor to see if there are undead sky pirates there.^So, undead pirates. We need to pass that little bit of news back along the chain of command, and fast. While you were inside the fort, I scouted out past it a bit and spotted an actual sky harbor further ahead. I already sent that information back to base camp, but, uh, if there are undead pirates then whoever they send there will be in for a big surprise. While I send this information back, make your way ahead to the harbor and see if you can find out whether there are undead pirates there that we need to watch out for.
Blackdagger Buccaneers^44^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Slay 4 Deathpledged, Hexers, and Ruffians in the Walk to the Plank.^I don't understand why so many of the crew stay loyal to Blackdagger after he spread his curse to them. Maybe they're just fanatical after all this time, or maybe the curse did something to their minds. I couldn't tell you. What I do know, though, is that some loyalists are searching for us nearby, seeking revenge on us for betraying their Pirate King. You say you're looking for skyships? Well, we don't know where the working ones are exactly, but if you drive off the loyalists nearby, we can tell you where to start looking. Deal?
Saving the Living^44^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Collect Pirate Cage Keys from Undead Pirate Hexers, Ruffians, and Deathpledged. Use the Pirate Cage Keys to rescue 4 Pirate Mutineers in the Walk to the Plank.^Further up the cliffside is a place where we used to execute traitors and cowards by making them walk the plank. This isn't just any normal gangplank though, no, this gangplank is built right into the cliffside, and when you step off the end there's nowhere to go but hundreds of feet down. Of course, now that we're the traitors, if we get captured then we get to take that walk. And that's exactly what's happening right now to a few of us who captured recently. If you can save them, I swear we'll help you any way we can.
The Inside Job^44^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Destroy 4 Ballistae in the Market Square, then rendezvous with Shil Yargo.^There's at least one skyship still skyworthy, and it's in the hands of Captain Kayliss, Blackdagger's second-in-command. She has a hideout somewhere in the city, although I don't know where. Kayliss made sure that only Blackdagger and her crew knew were it was. But, uh, I think your friends need your help first. We spotted a flying longboat coming around the edge of the island a few minutes ago. They were under fire from the ballistae in the market square below us. You should probably disable the ballistae and meet up with your friends before you go searching for Kayliss.
Opposition Research^44^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Gather 6 Pirate Hats from Deathpledged, Hexers, and Ruffians.^What? An undead pirate captain named Kayliss has a skyship stashed in a secret hideout? And you found this out from... stranded pirates who say they rebelled against Bartholomew Blackdagger? Sounds more like desperate mutineers telling tales. I'll send some scouts out to try to find this hideout, but I want you to check up on these mutineers' story. I want to know if these undead sky pirates here really are in Blackdagger's service. Take down a few of them and bring me back their hats. The insignias on the hats should tell us who their captain is.
Shattered Ships of the Sky^44^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Search 5 groups of Skyship Wreckage in the Skyship Docks.^I'm having a lot of trouble trusting these mutineers you're talking about. But regardless of whether their story is true or not, we can't go after this Captain Kayliss until we find her hideout, if it even exists. In the meantime, there's plenty of skyship wreckage down near the docks of the city that needs searching. While my scouts look around for Kayliss or any other opportunities, go pick your way through some of that wreckage and see if there's anything worth bringing back.
A Reason for Distress^44^Aluiries Arborshate^Pirates' Skyhold^Aluiries Arborshate^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Survey 5 Damaged Areas in Market Square and the Skyship Docks.^You made it so far on foot? Impressive. Perhaps you can assist me. Something powerful attacked this place a long time ago. Something that I believe is still here. For our safety, we must discover what it is. I'd like you to search the damage in the city and make record of anything that seems like it was not caused by standard weaponry. I urge you to make haste. I have already seen signs that this creature may be-- no, no, I will not engage in speculation. Return after your survey is finished, and I will tell you then.
Giving Unlikely Thanks^45^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Give Shil Yargo's thanks to Norver the Cook and the other mutineers.^I'd never have expected to get help from mutineers, but that tip about Kayliss really helped us out. Can you go speak to them and deliver my thanks? Tell them that I might even help them get off this island once I'm done here.
Back on Solid Ground^45^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^^^Return to the Protector's Enclave and report your success with Company Yargo to Sergeant Knox.^Well, <name>, you've earned my respect. And that's no easy task! But I don't have any more work for you right now, so head on back to Neverwinter whenever you're ready. If any of the rumors I've been hearing have any truth to them, you'll be needed there.
Missing in the Ash^56^Vandra Hillborn^Mount Hotenow^Geologist Darney^Mount Hotenow^^^Find out what happened to the Expedition Members within the Charred Woods.^We've lost a number of people, and there are those who are still missing. In particular, some members of Geologist Darney's team were sent to investigate disturbances underground, but never reported back. Should you find any sign of them, tell Geologist Darney, over by the bridge. He'll want to know what has happened to his people.
Knowledge From the Ashes^56^Vandra Hillborn^Mount Hotenow^Geologist Darney^Mount Hotenow^^^Get 8 Work Orders from Ashen Miners within the Charred Woods.^The pressure building under Mt. Hotenow threatens another eruption, but Geologist Darney has a plan to stop it. The Ashen Zombies prowling the burning forest were once dwarven miners who dug venting shafts designed to release pressure. Some of the zombies still carry their old work orders, which can tell us where those vents were. We need you to recover some of those work orders from the Ashen Zombies and take them to Geologist Darney so he can figure out how to vent the volcano.
Venting the Underneath^56^Geologist Darney^Mount Hotenow^Geologist Darney^Mount Hotenow^^^Deploy charges to clear blocked Vents within the Charred Woods.^In order to stop the volcano from erupting, we need to vent the pressure. Thanks to the old work orders you collected, we know where the ancient dwarves built vents. Unfortunately, most of them have been blocked by debris. I've got a crate of mining charges here, but with my assistants all dead I'm going to need your help to place those charges and clear those vents.
Planting for the Future^56^Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^^^Plant Heartleaf's seeds around Mt. Hotenow.^I wish to plant the seeds you gathered, but I am too weak to leave my tree for long. You have already helped me so much. Can I ask for your help once more to sow the first seeds of a new forest?
Seeds of Rebirth^57^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^Historian Thrimbul or Heartleaf the Dryad^Mount Hotenow^^^Recover the Dryad's wayward seedlings.^Before we can press the fight against Gommoth and General Ignazar, we must first help one of our allies. The dryad Heartleaf has been our hidden sentinel, watching enemy movements from her tree. However, some of her tree's seeds were blown into the ruins, and the seedlings are now growing on dangerous ground. Recover the seedlings, and bring them either to her or to me.
History of Hotenow^57^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^^^Recover relics and carvings depicting the history of the ruins.^General Ignazar's Archons will need to regroup after the blows you've dealt them. This presents us with an opportunity to gather vital information. It is my belief that Gommoth seeks some source of power beneath Mt. Hotenow, although I cannot say what it may be. The carvings and relics found amid these Delzoun ruins could provide vital clues. And now is an excellent time to collect those artifacts.
The Fire Fighters^58^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^^^Meet with Surveyor Baera in the Caldera to press the attack on Gommoth's forces.^With General Ignazar defeated, you've put Gommoth on the defensive. Now is the time to take the battle to him within the caldera of Mt. Hotenow itself. Surveyor Baera has set up a small base camp there. She thinks she can find a way into Gommoth's temple, but she'll need help.
Secrets of Fire^58^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^^^Misalign Gommoth's Focusing Shrines^The scrying devices have revealed that part of Gommoth's ritual involves focusing the power of shrines placed within the Caldera. They seem to require precise alignment, so even the slightest disturbance will delay the ritual. Misalign those shrines and buy us the time we need to stop Gommoth.
Sealing the Crypts^8^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^The Haunted Doomguide^The Dread Horde, The Barrow Lords^Help sanctify the crypts beneath the shrine of Kelemvor by collecting the Broken Seals and re-lighting the Braziers.^This temple of Kelemvor provides us with a haven against Idris' army of undead, but it is not as secure as it should be. Grave robbers have broken into the crypts beneath the temple breaking the mystical seals that ensure those who are buried there remain at rest. I need you to enter the crypt, re-light the sacred braziers and bring back the broken seals. I can repair the seals, and the holy fires will keep any more of the undead from entering the crypt.
The Barrow Lords^9^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Doomguide Soulhearth^Ebon Downs^Sealing the Crypts, The Scales of Kelemvor^The Soul Slavers, The Drowned King^Enter the five lesser barrows and destroy the Deathknell Shards.^Idris has used magical shards of an artifact called the Deathknell to seal the entrance to her fortress. You must destroy the shards before you can enter the Royal Rise and stop Idris' evil. But be warned, the shards are hidden in the ancient barrows of Ebon Downs and guarded by powerful wights.
Beneath Skull Fortress^43^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Shaben Shortcloak^Pirates' Skyhold^Search and Seizure^The Dead City^Discover the Secret of Skull Fortress.^I noticed something strange when I was scouting out the inside of this fort earlier. No treasure. Not one shred of pirate plunder. Where did it all go? The lizards have no use for it. I think I know where it went. There's a trap door in the back of the fort that I took a peek down before getting chased out. It leads into some kind of dungeon. I'd bet they've stashed it down there. You'd have to be crazy to go down there with all the lizardfolk, though. No chance anyone would make it out alive.
Scoundrel's Retreat^45^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^Shil Yargo^Pirates' Skyhold^^^Defeat Captain Kayliss and claim her skyship for Company Yargo.^The scouts I sent to find Kayliss' hideout came back with good news. They saw something that looked like a hideout entrance in the cliffside on the other side of the docks. Maybe your mutineers were being on the level with us after all. I have a lot of crew injured here, but you seem like you're pretty good at taking care of yourself. How does going down there solo sound? Getting me the skyship I want would put you in my good graces, and lemme tell you: I'm a very good person to be in the good graces of.
Shadowfire Cavern^56^Geologist Darney^Mount Hotenow^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^^^Enter Shadowfire Cavern and slay the Magma Elemental.^I've traced the pattern of the pressure you vented, and all the vents lead to a central point: A lava chamber called the Shadowfire Cavern. It makes sense. One of my prospectors reported that he'd found a Magma Elemental there before the attacks started. He went back to investigate, and never returned. If that Magma Elemental is under the control of Gommoth it was probably responsible for the near eruption. It needs to be destroyed.
Fireguard Fortress^57^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^Historian Thrimbul^Mount Hotenow^^^Enter Fireguard Fortress and slay General Ignazar.^General Ignazar commands his Fire Archon army from deep within Fireguard Fortress. From that position, they can easily strike anywhere near Mt. Hotenow. The need is clear: If there is to be any chance to stop Gommoth, General Ignazar and Fireguard Fortress must fall. 
Temple of the Primordial^58^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^Surveyor Baera^Mount Hotenow^^^Enter the Temple of the Primordial and slay Gommoth the Twisted.^Gommoth the Twisted built his Temple of the Primordial in hopes of waking Maegera, an ancient primordial being of fire who sleeps deep beneath Mt. Hotenow. We've done everything we can to delay him, but sooner or later he will succeed, unless you are brave enough to storm the Temple and slay Gommoth.
Blood Fuel^59^Darnys Loreweaver^Whispering Caverns^Darnys Loreweaver^Whispering Caverns^Lifting Shadow^^Rescue elven captives from the Sacrificial Chamber in the Whispering Caverns.^A fellow elf has come to our aid. Good. This situation calls for the kind of experience you cannot find among humans or dwarves. The drow, our exiled cousins, expend absurd amounts of thought and energy on getting revenge on their surface-dwelling ancestors. From time to time, they get close. This is such a time. The drow of House Xorlarrin have captured a collection of powerful elven magicians in hopes of opening a portal to the Feywild. A portal through which they would invade the holy city of Evermeet. We need to rescue the captives quickly and quietly. Will you do it?
Prejudiced^10^Johari^Tower District^Patrol Captain Lanward^Tower District^^Unsettling Rumors^Speak with Patrol Captain Lanward about why half-orcs aren't being allowed into the Tower District.^Finally, someone who can maybe talk some sense into these humans! They're stopping half-orcs who want to enter the district. Something about how we could be Many-Arrows sympathizers. Pfah! Neverwinter is as much MY home as is it for any of these guardsmen, and I want to help without being looked at like I'm some kind of traitor! Talk to this Lanward here and tell him that we half-orcs are no friends to the Many-Arrows!
Unsettling Rumors^11^Patrol Captain Lanward^Tower District^Patrol Captain Lanward^Tower District^Prejudiced^Spellscarred Orcs^Search for and slay a Spellscarred Orc in Waukeen's Way of the Tower District.^Look, tensions are running high here. I can't just let any half-orc come in here and start running around. I have to take the other guardsmen into account too. It's them you have to convince. I can let you into the district if you lend a hand against the Many-Arrows. You may change some minds about half-orcs. I could use a hand at the moment with a scouting task. My patrolmen have given me reports of some of the Many-Arrows orcs up in Waukeen Way sporting markings that look like spellscars. Head up there and see if you can confirm those reports.
Spellscarred Orcs^12^Patrol Captain Lanward^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Unsettling Rumors^Vansi's New Weapon^Warn Captain Janros in the Tower District about the spellscarred Many-Arrows orcs.^I'd heard rumors of the Many-Arrows leader, Vansi Bloodscar, having somehow gotten a spellscar. But why would some of her warriors have them as well? How could so many of them have gotten them without leaving the district? I don't know what's happening, but I don't like it. Head along the road eastward to the guard post and speak to Captain Janros about this. Maybe he can make some sense of it. And even if not, he should be warned.
Vansi's New Weapon^14^Captain Janros^Tower District^Captain Janros^Tower District^Spellscarred Orcs^^Search for and slay 3 Spellscarred Commanders in the Merchant's Square of the Tower District.^While the origin of the spellscars on the Many-Arrows orcs is a mystery to me, there can be little doubt it is part of their plan to defeat us. Spellscars, while dangerous, often grant their owner some degree of supernatural powers. Likely they intend to use them to their advantage. It could be that Vansi Bloodscar has somehow discovered how to deliberately afflict her warriors with spellscars, however reckless that plan would clearly be. Whatever the case, we must act quickly to neutralize the threat. Go to Merchant Square and slay as many spellscarred orcs as you can find.
Dangerous Reagents^36^Shagrol^Ebon Downs^Shagrol^Ebon Downs^^Blood and Spirit^Collect 5 Wight Dust off of wights and shadar-kai.^I am Shagrol, a shaman of the Many-Arrows. Don't worry, I bear you no grudge for fighting against us in the Tower District. Actually, I wanted to ask for your help. Vansi Bloodscar, our slain leader, claimed she had allied with someone who could grant spellscars, and she rewarded her followers with them. But I worry there was more to that bargain than Vansi suspected. The veil between the worlds is thin here. With the right ritual we can summon Vansi's spirit and ask her directly, but I need the proper reagents. There are wights nearby, and their dust would do nicely. You might also find the shadar-kai carrying it.
Blood and Spirit^36^Shagrol^Ebon Downs^Shagrol^Ebon Downs^Dangerous Reagents^Bloodscar's Last Testament^Burn Shagrol's magic incense at 3 Half-orc Graves in Ebon Downs in order to enlist their aid in guiding Vansi's spirit.^I have all I need now, but the ritual by itself won't be enough to guide Vansi's spirit back. We need to ask for help from the spirits of others of our kin. There are no orcs buried in Ebon Downs, but there are those of your kind, the half-bloods, and they are more likely to listen to you than to me. While you were gathering the wight dust, I looked into the spirit world and found where these half-bloods are buried. Take this incense. If you burn it at their graves, the spirits of the half-bloods will hear your request.
Bloodscar's Last Testament^36^Shagrol^Ebon Downs^Shagrol^Ebon Downs^Blood and Spirit^^Meet at Shagrol's Cave and help him to Summon Vansi Bloodscar's Spirit.^I spit on the Prophet and the weilders of the blue fire! Stinking filth, rank betrayers, worthy only to be gutted by my blade! You... I remember you. Maybe you'll be strong enough to deal out the death and revenge that I crave. It was the Prophet. She spoke to me with beguiling words, promises I couldn't resist. But she was only a pawn herself. I don't know who her real masters are, but I do know that they can use the Spellplague to warp and control the minds of the plaguechanged. The Prophet convinced me that the spellscars were simply weapons, and that she only wished to see Neverember overthrown. I should have known better.
He Who Never Sleeps^49^Shagrol^The Chasm^Shagrol^The Chasm^^The Half-Blood Savior^Defeat 4 Plaguechanged Orcs and 20 Plaguechanged Aberrants in the Unhallowed Grounds.^It is good you are here. I can tell that you have grown even stronger than when we met last. I have tracked the plaguechanged Many-Arrows orcs here, where they are now serve the masters Vansi spoke of.  Perhaps we can free them with a direct appeal to our god, Gruumsh. With your strength and orcish blood, Gruumsh may listen to you.  Gruumsh sees every orc that slays or is slain. Go and kill some of the plaguechanged orcs in order to make Gruumsh take notice. Slaughter the plaguechanged aberrants as well, to please Gruumsh and make him more likely to listen.
The Half-Blood Savior^51^Shagrol^The Chasm^Shagrol^The Chasm^He Who Never Sleeps^^Go to Shagrol's Cave in the Chasm and Protect him from the Plaguechanged while he asks Gruumsh to free the Many-Arrows orcs from the control of the masters of the Spellplague.^Hah! It is likely enough that you will destroy these creatures beneath the Chasm, spitting them like fish on a longspear. How amusing. Very well, then. I will grant you this one request. There is a cord that binds the plaguechanged orcs' will to the minds of these ancient creatures, and by my spear this cord will be cut. Though the blood is weak in you, your strength is admirable, especially for one so young. You may not serve me, but when you are a foe, you are a worthy one. There is little more that I desire. Now go, mortal.
The Stronghold^4^The Messenger^Protector's Enclave^The Steward^Stronghold^^Meet the Team^Meet the Steward in your Guild Stronghold.^Greetings, m'Lord. I'm here on behalf of a Steward seeking willing and able guilds to aid him. He told me to keep my words short and just say that your guild has been chosen to help him build up the Stronghold to something magnificent and to, in his words, "make ourselves rich beyond our wildest dreams". Here are the directions to the Stronghold. I suggest you leave as soon as you can.
Meet the Team^4^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^The Stronghold^The Stronghold Routine^Meet the Ranger, the Master of Coin, the Builder, and the Cleric.^If we're all going to be working together, you should meet the rest of the team. Just don't talk with them for too long. We all have things to do. Beware of the Master of Coin. She will talk for a long time, if you let her. Don't let her.
Stronghold: Keeping the Peace^70^The Ranger^Stronghold^The Ranger^Stronghold^^^Defeat 100 Enemies within the Stronghold.^Hi, Adventurer, I've got a task that's a little bit over my abilities, maybe you can help? We need help keeping the peace in the area, whether it's from invaders or the local beasts. The Steward has put together what he calls an "incentive" package for any members of the guild who can prove that they've helped make this area a bit more peaceful. I'd love to claim the reward myself, but unfortunately, I'm not all that strong. Maybe you could do it?
Sharandar Support^70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^^^Complete 3 Quests in Sharandar^The guild has received a notice for help from the elves in Sharandar. Oh, I wish I could go there! They're having difficulty dealing with the forces that are trying to ruin their land. The letter says that any adventurer should know their way around Sharandar by now and asked that a member of the guild travel there to give them aid. Can you take care of this?
Icewind Dale Support^70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^^^Complete 3 Quests in Icewind Dale^Hi, Adventurer! I received some exciting news from Caer-Konig. They need help from the guild regarding various threats that are around the town. The mayor of Caer-Konig promised a nice reward for the guild if someone was sent out to help with the situation. Could you make the trek to Caer-Konig and give them a hand?
Dread Ring Support^70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^^^Complete 3 Quests in Dread Ring^Hello, Adventurer! I have a request from our allies currently fighting in the Dread Ring. They've requested the guild's help by name. That's right, by name! They want members of the guild to go to the Dread Ring and support the campaign against the Thayans in the area. Do you think you can help? The resources you could find there would really help the Stronghold!
Well of Dragons Support^70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^^^Complete 3 Quests in the Well of Dragons^Adventurer. We've been receiving several requests for aid in the Well of Dragons. Quite a dangerous place! Can you go there and do whatever you can to help out? The guild has been promised several valuable resources if we're able to lend our support.
How They Do It^34^Jilef Hillborn^Helm's Hold^Gurzek Balegaze^Helm's Hold^^A Practical Demonstration^See if one of the Devils are willing to talk to you.^You're telling me that you want to know how these devils work magic? None of us here are spellcasters, wizard. Even if we were, how do you think these cultists got started? Let me guess. You're careful! No demonologist here! I suppose you don't become a wizard unless you're at least a little bit insane, but please, if you're going to investigate the infernal powers, do it well outside of our camp!
A Practical Demonstration^34^Gurzek Balegaze^Helm's Hold^^Helm's Hold^How They Do It^Object Lesson^Defeat 4 Ashmadai Warlocks to test their abilities.^Pleased to meet you, wizard. You have questions about our magicians? I am no magician. Where I come from power is abundant, but tightly controlled. You wish to see a demonstration? Go and do battle with the Ashmadai Warlocks. They tap into our power with their passions, and they can channel much of it through their bodies. However, even in great danger, they cannot take more than is granted to them. Such is their contract with our rulers.
Object Lesson^34^Gurzek Balegaze^Helm's Hold^Gurzek Balegaze^Helm's Hold^A Practical Demonstration^^Find an example of a Devil's Contract and see for yourself how restrictive the devils can be.^Still not convinced that our powers are ill suited for an independent spellcaster? I'm going quite against my nature to persuade you, but who cares? I'm on holiday! There's nothing in my contract that prevents me from speaking my mind. It's all contracts, you know. Would you like to look at one? There is a seer nearby who has need of a summoning circle. Hexabaal, I think his name is. If you look for the outermost rings, the most damning clauses are usually filled in there. Quite fine print though. Look closely.
Free Sample: Food^4-70^The Barmaid^Stronghold^Waiter^Stronghold^^^Receive a free food sample!^Ah, Adventurer, I've not seen your face around here before. Allow me to introduce myself, I'm The Barmaid, and that animated fellow behind me, that's The Chef. The Steward has had us set up shop here in order to help feed you, your fellow adventurers and the other residents of the stronghold.  But I'm sure a well-travelled adventurer with a discerning palette won't be won over so easily. Allow us to prove that we're more than just a glorified larder by treating you to a meal on the house. I insist. The Waiter left the kitchen only a moment ago with a freshly baked Sambocade. He'll be on the terrace above serving other customers, let him know I sent you
Free Sample: Overload Enchantments^60-70^The Gemmonger^Stronghold^^Stronghold^^^Take your free Overload Enchantment sample!^Greetings Adventurer! I am The Gemmonger, and I deal in overload enchantments. Perhaps you're familiar? They're powerful but ephemeral items that may only be affixed to special overload slots. I'm of the mind that seeing is believing. I've prepared a piece of equipment and a Mark of the Orc Slayer for one of your companions. When used in combat the enchantment will gradually lose its charge until it fades away. You may return here at any time for a new one... for a nominal fee, of course. As the guild's Stronghold grows, I will have a wider array of more powerful enchantments available, so make sure to keep an eye on the marketplace.
My Fae Lady^20^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Travel with Care^What Lurks in the Corners^Defeat Stronghold Enemies and recover Pixies, then release them in the Fae Canopy.^Hi! Did the Ranger send you? Oh, he's so nice when he remembers things! I have a problem. I love calculating our numbers while walking in the back of the Fae Canopy. Sometimes little pixies come out to say hello! Recently, several of the pixies have all gone missing. One of the few remaining ones told me they were kidnapped by enemies of the Stronghold! Please, you have to rescue the pixies and release them back into the Fae Canopy!
What Lurks in the Corners^70^The Cleric^Stronghold^The Cleric^Stronghold^My Fae Lady^Welcome to Homestead^Make contact with a ghostly figure near the Grim Forest.^Yes, yes, I know, there was a ghost that told you some ominous phrase or what not. The Master of Coin hasn't stopped talking to me about it. Several people have told me about a ghost appearing around the area of the Grim Forest. Everyone's too scared to try to talk to it, but I figure you're not one of those people. Try talking to the ghost and see what it needs to move on to the next life. Once you get that, I'll see about ushering our "friend" off of his current plane of existence.
Welcome to Homestead^70^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^What Lurks in the Corners^A New Sheriff^Talk to Jundus, then defeat Stronghold Enemies to recover Stolen Property.^We've got a problem, Adventurer. A man that I'm quite suspicious of has moved into the Homestead with his daughter. The man's name is Jundus. He is continually robbed of his goods more than any other person in Homestead. The Ranger says Jundus never lets anyone in his home, and that his daughter constantly argues with her father. I want you to hunt down whoever stole his goods, get them back, then bring them to me. I want to know who this Jundus really is and if he's a danger to the Stronghold.
A New Sheriff^70^The Ranger^Stronghold^The Ranger^Stronghold^Welcome to Homestead^A Steward and His Mimic^Speak to The Sheriff, in Homestead.^Adventurer, I think I'm in love, and I need your help. There's a new Sheriff in town... named Sheriff, of course. She's in Homestead now, and I'd like it if you could go out and ask what her real name is. If I did it, the Steward may fire me, but he seems to have taken a liking to you, so... maybe you could get away with it?
Wizard's Tower Tier 1 Upgrade^70^Wizard's Workshop#Daily Wizard^Stronghold^Wizard^Stronghold^^^Deliver 10 Potion of Superior Healing. The potions cannot be bound to your character.^Ah... a member of the guild. Quite excellent to see you here. My work is going smoothly, thanks to the guild's resources, but I fear I require aid in a particular subject matter. I am researching the effectiveness of potions, you see... specifically those that provide healing to others. I currently only have weaker potions, which has done me no good. Perhaps you could find some Superior Potions of Healing and deliver them to me?
Wizard's Tower Tier 2 Upgrade^70^Wizard's Workshop#Daily Wizard^Stronghold^Wizard^Stronghold^^^Take Thayan Tomes from Thayans in the Dread Ring^I have run into a problem, Adventurer, one that requires your expertise. I have been researching Thayans and their magics and require more information to properly deal with their methods. Specifically, I require the tomes that their members carry on them. My contacts tell me that the Thayans in the Dread Ring should have said tomes. Would be able to go and recover them for me?
Forming the Guild^20^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Anton Omeris^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to the Guild Registrar, Anton Omeris^Neverwinter has been facing a lot of problems, and you've done an excellent job in helping us. However, imagine all the good you could do if you were banded together with a larger number of adventurers in a guild! Speak to Anton Omeris. He will tell you about the benefits of being in a guild, and he can help you get a guild officially recognized by Lord Neverember.
Explorer's Guild Tier 1 Upgrade^70^Explorer's Guild#Daily Master Explorer^Stronghold^Master Explorer^Stronghold^^^Recover 3 Explorer's Notes from skill nodes.^I say, Adventurer, it is a good day for exploring, is it not? Interested in a little game? I hope you are, because I'm going to give you one! Some of my fellows have hidden notes throughout the world. If your guild is worthy to continue having the Explorer's Guild around, you'll find three of those notes and return them to me! Well? What are you waiting for?
Explorer's Guild Tier 2 Upgrade^70^Explorer's Guild#Daily Master Explorer^Stronghold^Master Explorer^Stronghold^^^Collect 6 Lost Idols from skill nodes^Adventurer, good day! I can see that look in your eyes. The yearning for exploration, the desire for discovery! If that is the case, then I have a challenge for you!  Lost idols, you find them, bring them to me, and we shall declare them no longer lost. Let the hunt begin!
Explorer's Guild Tier 3 Upgrade^70^Explorer's Guild#Daily Master Explorer^Stronghold^Master Explorer^Stronghold^^^Collect 9 Ancient Keys from skill nodes^The time for exploring is upon us! If it wasn't, you would not be here, and I would be halfway across the plains to explore Myth Drannor. I digress, however. We begin our game once more, my friend. I have hidden several ancient keys all throughout various high-traffic adventuring areas. Retrieve them for me, and you will continue to prove that your guild is worthy of the Explorer's Guild!
A Steward and His Mimic^70^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^A New Sheriff^Luskan's History^Find out what The Detective is doing in Homestead.^Adventurer, we have a problem. A dragonborn detective has recently introduced himself to me and asked to live here. I'm wary of this dragonborn. He claims he is here to investigate the land, but some of his clothing indicates that he was recently in Waterdeep. I'd like you to speak to the Detective and see what it is he wants. The Sheriff has already turned away some busy bodies from Waterdeep, I don't want to deal with any more.
The Red Wizards^70^Sergeant Knox (Dread Ring)^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox (Dread Ring)^Dread Ring^^^Hunt down Evokers, Conjurers, and Illusionists in the Dread Ring.^The armies protecting the Dread Ring are mostly made up of undead, devils, warrior-slaves, and whatever else the Thayans can muster, but the Red Wizards that lead them are the true threat. It is the Red Wizards who keep the stitched-together Thayan war machine running. In order to win this battle, in order to break the spine of the Dread Ring's defenders, we need to take out the Red Wizards. Find and slay as many of them as you can. Use caution, for Red Wizards are powerful foes.
Biggrin's Tomb^70^Bowen Brant or Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^Automatic^Caer-Konig^^^Enter Biggrin's Tomb and prevent the return of Biggrin.^I have need of your skill and discretion.  Many years ago an apprentice of the Arcane Brotherhood named Akar Kessell gained a powerful artifact and attempted to conquer Icewind Dale. Savage creatures of all sorts flocked to serve Kessell, chief among them was a mighty frost giant called Biggrin. The giant died at the hands of a pair of renowned heroes, and Kessell himself was overthrown. But Kessell was not completely destroyed, he has returned in undead form. And I have reason to believe he is attempting to restore Biggrin as well. One of our people witnessed a group of wights entering Biggrin's tomb. I fear they intend to perform a ritual that will raise the giant from the dead. We do not need another undead reminder of the Brotherhood's troubled past. I want you to enter that tomb and prevent the ritual
Pride Shattering^47^Tori Hammerheart^Icespire Peak^Tori Hammerheart^Icespire Peak^^The Benefit of Experience^Destroy 5 Goblin Totems at the Front Lines in Icespire Peak^You're that adventuring dwarf from Neverwinter, right? The name <name> is going to show up in many sagas, I think. Care to add to that legacy? Icespire Peak is in terrible shape. Goblins are making trophies from the skulls of dwarves the trolls kill. Totems. Its hurting the morale of the warriors on the front lines. We need to send a message. Get out there and do what you do best. Trash those totems and let the goblins, trolls and giants know that dwarves don't cower before their enemies. 
The Benefit of Experience^48^Tori Hammerheart^Icespire Peak^Orreft Mountwatch^Icespire Peak^Pride Shattering^Experience Loss^Speak with Orreft Mountwatch at the Guerilla Camp in Icespire Peak^I've been studying the situation here, and I think I have some useful notes. I hear an old friend of mine is commanding a forward warband. I've written a letter with my recommendations. Please carry this to Orreft Mountwatch. He's supposed to be in some kind of Guerilla Camp in the highest parts of the mountain.
Experience Loss^48^Orreft Mountwatch^Icespire Peak^Orreft Mountwatch^Icespire Peak^The Benefit of Experience^^Slay 5 Ice Troll Veterans in Jotunstead on Icespire Peak^Tori Hammerheart is a tactical genius. Citadel Adbar stands now in part thanks to her. And if she has recommendations, I'm taking them. She says the ice trolls below are frontline grunts, and suspects the ones up here are veterans, held in reserve for a major assault. It makes sense. So you're going to stall their advance and kill me some veteran ice trolls in their home, Jotunstead. Does that sound like a plan to you?
A Matter of Dwarves and Farms^60^Sergeant Knox or Neverwinter Recruit^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^^Attack at Dusk^Speak with Captain Belgold in Protector's Enclave.^Hello, <name>. One of the guards in Neverwinter, Captain Belgold, is looking for you. He said he needed the help of an able adventurer, due to the Neverwinter guard being stretched thin. Would you be willing to talk to Captain Belgold and help?
Attack at Dusk^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^A Matter of Dwarves and Farms^The Pwent^Seek out Spider of The Grinning Ponies in Driftwood Tavern^Greetings, <name>. I just received a report of trouble out by a farm, but I don't have the manpower to check it out. Can you look into it for me? I'll make it worth your while. There's a band of halfling riders in town right now calling themselves the Grinning Ponies. One of them - calls himself Spider - in the Driftwood Tavern can tell you more
The Pwent^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Attack at Dusk^The Throne of the Dwarven Gods^Investigate the Ashmadai camp in Neverwinter Wood.^One of my scouts just came in from Neverwinter Wood with some very useful information. Several Ashmadai camps have recently appeared in Neverwinter Wood. Lucky for us, Pwent has been attacking said camps. My scout believe he's looking for something. We have the location of the last Ashmadai camp, and I bet Pwent will be there. Finish off the Ashmadai, then see if you can get any more information about Pwent's connection to the vampire drow.
The Throne of the Dwarven Gods^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^The Pwent^The Helm of Bruenor Battlehammer^Find Thibbledorf Pwent in Gauntlgrym.^Like I promised, I've had a few scouts out looking for that dwarf for the last few days, and sure enough, he has been spotted near the ruins of Gauntlgrym.  We need to know more about him. He could be a threat to Neverwinter if he's in league with the vampire drow. Find him for me. Find out what he knows.
The Helm of Bruenor Battlehammer^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^The Throne of the Dwarven Gods^A Lost Dwarf^Recover Bruenor Battlehammer's Helm in the Ashmadai Lair.^Our scouts have found the Thayan wizard, Candelaria. She's made a lair for herself in Mount Hotenow. I'll mark the location on your map. I wish I could be there to help you, but my place is here within Neverwinter. Good luck, and let's hope that Moradin's blessing doesn't have an expiration date
A Lost Dwarf^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^The Helm of Bruenor Battlehammer^Tattered Maps^Investigate the disappearance of Bonnego Battleaxe in the foothills of Vellosk.^A member of the Neverwinter Guard disappeared into the foothills of Vellosk a few days ago. He was out wandering on his own, against all protocol. We've had a few reports of orcs gathering in that area, and I simply can't spare enough soldiers to safely investigate. I need you to scout the area and see if you can find any evidence of what happened to our soldier. He's a red-bearded dwarf named Bonnego.  If you find him alive, bring him back. If not, well, at least we'll know. You'll be paid well, of course.
Tattered Maps^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^A Lost Dwarf^Shallow Waters^Seek out Bonnego Battleaxe in Driftwood Tavern^Bonnego Battleaxe is at Driftwood Tavern hoping to catch up to you. I believe he's planning to set off on another adventure. I'm afraid nothing will stop Bonnego from going off on his own, even if I ordered him. I need you to accompany him wherever he wants to go, and I'll make sure you're compensated for your time. Just make sure Bonnego makes it back alive. The Neverwinter guard lost Linkletter due to his personal business, we can't lose another guard for the same reason.
Shallow Waters^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Tattered Maps^Reclaimed Identity^Meet Bonnego Battleaxe at the village of Shallow Waters.^Several of my scouts have returned from Vellosk, and the situation is dire. The orc forces you warned us of are moving against the small village of Shallow Waters on the edge of Neverwinter Wood. Even worse, they've apparently enlisted a clan of ogres as allies. Lord Neverember said he would send a squad of soldiers to protect the town, but it would put my mind at ease if you would also go and help. Bonnego has already left, against my orders, to help the town.
Reclaimed Identity^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Shallow Waters^The Dwarven King^Seek out Bonnego Battleaxe in Driftwood Tavern^Bonnego has resigned from the Neverwinter Guard. I don't know what he's planning, but it can't be good.  He asked that you meet him in his "usual" spot in Driftwood tavern. I don't like this, <name>. I'm concerned about what Bonnego is planning if he's willing to throw away everything he's earned in the Neverwinter guard for some "map". Please go see what he's up to. I'll pull some strings to make sure you're well rewarded for ensuring Bonnego's safety.
The Dwarven King^60^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Bruenor Battlehammer^Gauntlgrym^Reclaimed Identity^Into Mantol-Derith^Seek out Bruenor Battlehammer in Driftwood Tavern^Bonnego is waiting for you in Driftwood Tavern. After telling me his story, he said that he realized where he went wrong and that he wanted the two of us to accompany him to Gauntlgrym. Unfortunately, I cannot leave my post in Neverwinter, even if it's only for a few days to journey into Gauntlgrym. I'm needed here, both by the people and by the guards. Go speak to Bonnego and send him my regards... and good luck with reclaiming Gauntlgrym. Many have tried, maybe you two might succeed.
Seeds for Everyone^60^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^^^Stop the Cult Seed Harvesting Ritual in the Cave of Elements.^My contacts in the Emerald Enclave report new cult activity outside the Cave of Elements in Ebon Downs. I'm afraid as long as elemental energy continues to accumulate in that cave, the elemental cults will try to steal it for their own use. Minsc has volunteered to stop them and has requested that you meet he and Boo there.
Gathering Seeds! For Goodness!^60^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^^^Stop the Cult Seed Harvesting Ritual on the Isle of Wind and Flames^My Emerald Enclave scouts have noticed that cultists have returned to the Isle of Wind and Flames in Pirates' Skyhold. It seems that isle is a nexus of elemental energy and the cult cannot resist trying to exploit it for their evil ends. Minsc and Boo will meet you there.
In Over Your Head^10^Coralyssa^Protector's Enclave^Coralyssa^Protector's Enclave^^^Learn more about your Infernal Pact, and your patron, Belial by reading books in Councilman Graves' possession.^My, you are a bright one, aren't you? I was once like you: full of untapped potential, brimming with desire for more power, and not an idea in my pretty little head of how to go about it. It's only natural to push yourself to your limits and beyond. But first, you'll want to know more about cultivating your relationship with Belial, Lord of Phlegethos. The look on your face tells me you don't fully comprehend what that means... Oh that's rich! You've gone and accepted this power without first doing your research. Perhaps that should be your first task. I happen to know that Councilman Aldwin Graves, in Helm's Hold, has recently done some research into your Patron's kind. Seems like a good starting place. Enjoy the edification.
Curses!^15^Coralyssa^Protector's Enclave^Coralyssa^Protector's Enclave^^^Drive out bandits from an abandoned cathedral outside of the city, and make them think twice about coming back by cursing their equipment.^Look, by its very nature, being a Warlock is dark business, and that doesn't tend to sit well with everyone. The Wizards are just jealous because they study tirelessly for years to gain a piddling amount of arcane power. If you ask me, the price a Warlock pays is a much better deal. Others tend to fear us because of the dark power we wield. Oh, and the fact that some of us actively bargain with fiends. We have to work extra hard to convince them that not all of us Warlocks are evil soul-harvesting devil-worshippers. Speaking of... There is an abandoned cathedral outside the city limits, which has recently been overrun by some pesky bandits. Go and give them hell! While you're at it, curse them and their belongings so that they, or any other bandits think twice about setting up shop in there again. And, before you worry about my motives behind telling you this, know that these bandits have been a thorn in Neverwinter's side for some time.  You'll be doing this city a service, oh great hero, so don't get too involved in the particulars.
Pain and Suffering^20^Coralyssa^Protector's Enclave^Coralyssa^Protector's Enclave^^^Go to Helm's Hold, where several known errant Warlock pact-breakers have made camp. Eliminate the Warlocks Coralyssa has marked with her Curse.^You don't look particularly enthused about your task to cause pain, suffering, and death upon your fellow Warlocks. "But Coralyssa! I'm supposed to be a goody-two-shoes hero and save Neverwinter or whatever!" Oh, don't worry about your valuable reputation - I'm sure it's already quite sterling, what with all the looting and murdering of the so-called monsters you do now anyway. Remember, your targets this time are all horrible, disreputable, pact-breakers, and one hundred percent rotten, even to devilish standards - so, not like you at all. I have it on good authority that they seek to renounce Belial and align with a different Lord of the Nine. Flay them until the sun comes up on the morrow for all I care, just collect the blood price from them and relinquish their souls to your dark patron. I've done you the service of cursing your targets' souls with noticeable auras, and only you will be able to pick up on that, so you can take them by surprise. Best of luck out there. Do try not to get killed.
The Delzoun Dwarfhold^59^Skuldomir Steelhelm^Whispering Caverns^Skuldomir Steelhelm^Whispering Caverns^^^Slay Draghaz the Excavator^Greetings, dwarf! It is good to see another of out kind here, and girded for battle no less! Some duergar, in the course of their mining, discovered an entrance to an ancient dwarven ruin. The Underdark Guides caught word of this find and informed me. I tried to make my way inside, but I could not overcome the guards. There were just too many. Maybe you'd succeed where I failed. Make your way into the Delzoun Dwarfhold, slay the duergar excavators, and get out. Interested?
Conquering Our Dread^70^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^General Sabine^Protector's Enclave^^My Enemy's Enemy, The Ashen Battlefield^Meet with General Sabine, leader of the Neverwinter Guard near the Hall of Justice.^This is it. Lord Neverember has ordered General Sabine and the Neverwinter Guard to attack Valindra's stronghold in the Neverwinter Wood -- the Dread Ring. Speak to General Sabine about how you can contribute to the battle. Remember the Battle of Sleeping Dragon Bridge? Well, it's time to finish what you started.
The Ashen Battlefield^70^General Sabine^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox (Dread Ring)^Dread Ring^Conquering Our Dread^Wages of War^Cross the Ashen Battlefield and reach the Vanguard Camp in the Dread Ring.^The Dread Ring is a terrible place of dark magic, foul wizards, and undying horrors. It also happens to be Valindra's seat of power on the Sword Coast and a blight that Lord Neverember has ordered me to remove. So you, hero, are going to help me do just that. I want you to report to Sergeant Knox in the Neverwinter Vanguard Camp we've set up in the Dread Ring. To get there, you'll have to make your way across the Ashen Battlefield - the desolate territory surrounding the Ring. You'll likely encounter resistance, since the Thayans are doing everything they can to cut off our supply lines. Once you're inside, harry the enemy. Disrupt their plans, weaken their forces, and open the way to Valindra herself. If you get the chance to kill that foul lich once and for all, you take it. Understand?
My Enemy's Enemy^70^General Sabine^Protector's Enclave^Jesket, the Renegade^Protector's Enclave^Conquering Our Dread^^Speak to Jesket, the Renegade in Protector's Enclave about the Thayan menace and the Dread Ring.^This man to my left is Jesket, a former Red Wizard of Thay, now living in exile. He and a significant number of other exiled Red Wizards have organized together in order to oppose the despotic reign of the lich zulkirs of Thay. Jesket was the one who delivered the crucial information we needed in order to attack the Dread Ring. We don't trust these Red Wizards and their "Thayan Resurrection", as they call it. We don't trust Jesket, or his master, Rath Modar. But they do have information we can use, so make sure to talk to them and see what you can find out.
Icewind Dale^70^Captain Dunmish^Protector's Enclave^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^A Chill Wind^Local Luminaries^Meet with Speaker Alden Lowell, leader of the town of Caer-Konig in Icewind Dale.^Icewind Dale has been a proving ground for heroes over the years. I'm glad to see you're taking this seriously. The black ice has torn Icewind Dale asunder. Mercenary factions vie for control of Caer-Konig, a town at the center of the trouble, and kill each other over black ice deposits in the wilderness. In addition, the normal dangers in the area - barbarians, trolls, bears, remorhazes - grow stronger and more violent the longer they are exposed to black ice. Black ice seems like a curse, but some local artisans have learned to fashion it into weapons and armor far more powerful than your Sword Coast trinkets. So what do you think? This is your last chance to back out. Care to try your skills in the unforgiving wilderness of Icewind Dale?
Earth Tremors^62^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Dassar Truebow^Reclamation Rock^^^Meet with Dassar Truebow at Reclamation Rock.^One of the travelers we rescued is from Helm's Hold - or Reclamation Rock as some people have taken to calling it - mentioned there has been a rash of small earth tremors in the area recently. It could be a coincidence... Or it could be a prelude to another disaster like the one that hit the coast here. I think you should investigate. Speak to Dassar Truebow at Reclamation Rock. He works for Neverember as part of the Lords Alliance. He should have a good idea of what's going on there.
Challenge: Moven the Slothful^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat Moven the Slothful in the Stronghold.^The Many-Arrow Orcs have a particularly strong hill giant called Moven the Slothful. He's been attacking several of my workers, along with a lot of merchants trying to get through the area. We need a member of the guild to handle Moven before he becomes a further problem.
Challenge: Halamvir the Smith^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat Halamvir the Smith in the Stronghold.^Some of my workers have reported something very... strange. A fire giant named Halamvir has been roaming around the Stronghold, challenging my workers to combat in order to, "test his new weapons". Luckily, he hasn't "killed" any of my workers, but they've all returned in fairly poor shape. Could you go deal with this fire giant before he puts any more of my workers out of commission?
Devils in the Hideaway^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat 20 devils in Devil's Hideaway^My workers have been complaining about a not-so-minor issue: "devils". They claim that they're practically swarming in Devil's Hideaway... I guess the Ranger's wasn't kidding around when he warned us about the area! Could you deal with the devils in that area? I've already had several workers threaten to quit because of them.
All Washed Up^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Recover six Washed Up Chests in Ancient Lake.^Have you been around Ancient Lake? The Ranger informed me of the oddest thing. Chests have been washing up from the lake! The Ranger opened them up and found they were empty, but then he went and "left" them there! I need those chests. We can break them down and use them for plenty of resources, all for free! Could you go to the Ancient Lake and get some of the washed up chests for me?
There Be Drakes^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat 20 Drakes in Dragon Hills.^I've got a real problem on my hands, Adventurer. I just had a few workers quit because they were nearly killed by drakes in Dragon Hills. Can you give me a hand by dealing with some of the drakes in the area? The Steward refuses to let me re-hire, well, "anyone", but I can at least show the others that the guild is here to maintain the peace.
Spider Be Gone^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat 20 spiders in Fae Canopy or Misty Hills^Adventurer, this time I have a... personal favor. The Master of Coin loves taking walks in the Fae Canopy, but as of late, spiders have started to swarm in the area. Could you handle the spiders? If the Master of Coin isn't wandering in the Fae Canopy, she's here, talking my head off. It's impossible to get any work done!
Challenge: Owlbears^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat the pair of Owlbears in the Stronghold.^Adventurer! My workers are reporting more problems. Who would have thought it would be so hard to build a civilization in an untamed land? There are a pair of owlbears that have been disrupting construction on several buildings. We've pooled together a bounty for anyone in the guild who can defeat them. Think you can take care of the problem?
Challenge: Gorgon^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat the Gorgon in the Stronghold.^Have you heard of a Gorgon? Well, my workers hadn't until recently, when one decided to storm through a construction site! It's still out there, somewhere. No one wants to return to work until they know the gorgon has been defeated. Can you help us out?
Challenge: Bulette^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat the Bulette in the Stronghold.^We've got a big problem, Adventurer. A group of halfling workers were almost eaten by a bulette! I don't know why a bulette has wandered here, but that creature won't stop until it has a meal out of our smaller workers. Can you deal with this bulette before it tries to make a meal out of anyone else?
Challenge: Argemius the Cyclops^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat Argemius the Cyclops in the Stronghold.^The Master of Coin has come to me with a problem. She and a few workers were walking through the Fae Canopy when they were attacked by a cyclops of all things! Everyone escaped, but now we have a cyclops roaming through the Fae Canopy, attacking anyone it sees. We need the guild's help to show this cyclops it isn't welcome in our land.
Stronghold: Beasts^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat 10 beasts in Maiden's Lane.^Adventurer, we're having nothing but problems down by Maiden's Lane. People keep trying to move in to the area, but beasts continue to plague us at every turn. We need the guild's help to try to clear the area of beasts.
Time Trial: Outer Stronghold^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Race through the Stronghold and earn rewards based upon your ranking.^Oh, hello, Adventurer! Are you up for a race? A few of us have pooled together some of our earnings to put up a wager - how many areas of the Stronghold can you reach within a limited time? I'm excited to see what you can do. Are you up for it?
My Only Enemy is Time^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat as many enemies as you can in the Stronghold within three minutes.^Hiya, Adventurer! I have an exciting task for you... defeating those that would threaten the Stronghold's way of life. The Steward has collected together several resources and is offering a bounty for whoever in the guild can defeat the most enemies within a limited time. He said something about it building character and being efficient, but it sounds to me like he just wants to see the guild engage in some competition.
The Stronghold Routine^20^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^Meet the Team^For Love of the Stronghold^Receive tasks given out by The Cleric, The Builder, and The Master of Coin.^Adventurer, we have been getting many requests for the guild's help throughout the lands. Of course, said requests have decent rewards alongside them. Speak to the Cleric, Master of Coin, and the Builder. They each have been collecting requests for aid and should have something suitable for a person of your skills.
For Love of the Stronghold^20^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^The Stronghold Routine^Travel with Care^Donate any eligible item to the Coffer. Visit the coffer to see what items can be donated.^Adventurer, if you and the guild are going to be in this Stronghold, then you'll have to do the work to keep the Stronghold running. Find anything you deem valuable and bring it to the Coffer. It will determine what is useful and take said item from you. We'll be using these items to build the Stronghold into something amazing, so don't hold back. We'll know if you do.
Worker Recruitment^20-69^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Travel to Protector's Enclave and recruit workers^Adventurer, we need workers, and you're just the person to go recruit them! Neverwinter is full of workers that are looking for a job. Can you go around the city and see if any of them would be willing to work for the guild?
Doing the Rounds^20-69^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^^^Complete Quests in a level appropriate zone^The Harpers have asked for the guild's help in keeping the peace around the Sword Coast. Do you think you can help? It could help us out a lot if we had the favor of the Harpers.
Keeping the Peace^20-69^The Ranger^Stronghold^The Ranger^Stronghold^^^Defeat 50 enemies in a level appropriate zone.^The Harpers have asked for the guild's help in keeping the peace around the Sword Coast. Do you think you can help? It could help us out a lot if we had the favor of the Harpers.
Guard Recruitment^20-69^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Recruit six mercenaries in Protector's Enclave.^Adventurer, the Master of Coin has entrusted a task to me, which I'm now entrusting to you! Our Stronghold needs more guards. The Master of Coin heard there are many mercenaries in Neverwinter that are looking for work. Could you go to Protector's Enclave and hire a few mercenaries to become guards for the Stronghold?
Challenge: Stormcaller Balhom^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat Stormcaller Balhom in the Stronghold.^Do you know what's worse than having a hill giant smash apart your construction site? Seeing several bolts of lightning strike down half a day's worth of work. Stormcaller Balhom of the Uthgardt tribe has been running around disrupting us left and right. Can you or someone from the guild put a stop to him?
Challenge: Dagyrc the Merciless^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat Dagyrc the Merciless in the Stronghold.^The mercenaries attacking our Stronghold have sent out a particularly vicious gnoll called Dagyrc the Merciless. What's particularly "grating" is that this gnoll is only attacking workers, as if the mercenaries know that the way to stop us from progressing is to take out our infrastructure! None of the workers are keen to get back to work with Dagyrc roaming about. Can you do something about this?
A Matter of Dragons^70^Travelling Wizard^Stronghold^Travelling Wizard^Stronghold^^^Participate in the guild event, The Golden Bell from the Zen Store to trigger this event. The dragons in this event are recommended for a party of 10 to 15 adventurers.^Ah, Adventurer, hello, hello! Did you know that four very dangerous dragons terrorize the lands nearby? They will, no doubt, turn their eyes towards the Stronghold. I have a method to lure these dragons to this land, but I can only use said method infrequently, or with the aid of a magical item. I'm sure I know the answer, but would you be up for some... dragon slaying?
Local Luminaries^70^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Icwewind Dale^Icewind Schism^Speak to the local business owners of Caer-Konig.^You're new to town. Plenty of adventurers have shown up here, brashly ran off into the hinterlands in search of black ice, never to be heard from again. Black ice is a powerful substance, but lust for it can make you... well, reckless, for one. Before you start gathering your fortune, there are a few local business owners you should meet. These are the people who will pour your drinks, repair your armor, and pack your supplies. You'll want to cultivate a reputation for integrity, reliability, and generosity with these folks. If you can do that, you're fortune is half made already. Swing by the Hook, Line, and Sinker, and talk to Eglendar, the bartender there. He's a good man to know.
Icewind Schism^70^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Local Luminaries^Expert Advice^Learn about Ten-Towns and the Arcane Brotherhood, then accept a temporary contract with a faction.^The people of the Ten-Towns have begun to profit from the presence of black ice, but the Arcane Brotherhood has also expressed an interest. You'll find that the two parties have different goals and intentions regarding what should be done with this new resource. These strong opinions have led to conflict and, regrettably, violence. Being the accommodating fellow that I am, I have arranged for a solution to these conflicts. I let representatives of each faction recruit adventurers such as yourself here in town, for a nominal fee to the, er... Town coffers, of course. Bowen Brant has come from the city of Bryn Shander to represent the interests of the Ten-Towns, and Anara the Cerulean is here from Luskan to represent the Arcane Brotherhood. You should speak to each of them to learn who you'd prefer to work with. Of course, the contract you accept is only temporary, so you could always work for the other faction at a later time. Everyone can profit, you see?
Expert Advice^70^Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^Icewind Schism^Hunting for Black Ice^Travel to Frostmound Keep in Icewind Pass, and learn to mine black ice from Beorne Steelstrike.^I expect you want to get your hands on some black ice now. After all, why trek across the tundra unless there's something in it for you. But before you can start earning your fortune, you'll need to learn the technique from a master. Seek out Beorne Steelstrike in Frostmound Keep, up in Icewind Pass. He'll show you how to pry even the most stubborn black ice from the ground.
Scratching the Surface^70^Beorne Steelstrike^Icewind Pass^Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^Hunting for Black Ice^Icewind Adventures^Travel to Caer-Konig and speak to Anara the Cerulean or Bowen Brant.^Well, I've done my part. You should run on back to Caer-Konig. I'm sure Anara the Cerulean has more for her new agent to do.
Icewind Adventures^70^Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Scratching the Surface^Unwanted Elements^Speak to Noramos Battleheart, Flint Vreesh, Grigoi Skrimshander, and Gurth Grimstalker, accept and complete quests in Icewind Pass, then speak to Alden Lowell in Caer-Konig.^I am pleased you have chosen to work with the Arcane Brotherhood. We have brought much wealth to Caer-Konig, and we all profit as a result. You'll want to speak with Flint Vreesh of the Brotherhood, the merchant Grigoi Skrimshander, and the ranger Gurth Grimstalker. They'll recognize the contract you carry and provide you with information on how you can be of assistance to the people of Caer-Konig. But before you do, speak with Noramos Battleheart. He is responsible for the security of our operations outside of Caer-Konig, where agents of the Ten-towns threaten our interests... and our agents. 
Unwanted Elements^70^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Icewind Adventures^Speak to the Speaker^Speak to Baerick Hammerstone and Urgus Battlehammer to cure Baerick's madness in Caer-Konig.^You want to be careful with that raw black ice. Hold it in that form too long, it will start to affect your mind. There is someone in Caer-Konig who might be able to help you refine the black ice, but I'm afraid he's somewhat... unstable. He's prone to outbursts, but he and his cousin Urgus are the only people who know how to forge that stuff. I'd banish him from town, but he's brought in so much money. Talk to Baerick Hammerstone. Maybe you'll be lucky and he'll be lucid. If he's not, talk to Urgus Battlehammer. He brings in useful goods from all over Icewind Dale. Maybe he can dig up something to help you reach Baerick.
Speak to the Speaker^70^Baerick Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Unwanted Elements^The Long Night^Speak to Alden Lowell in Caer-Konig.^Will you carry a message for me to the Speaker, Alden Lowell? He should know that I've been cured of the black ice madness, and I'm ready to help the town purify all the cursed black ice ignorant adventurers seem to be hoarding like mad. If I'm going to do that, I'm going to have to expand my operation. And if I am going to expand, I'm going to need the Speaker's help.
The Long Night (Caer-Konig Quest)^70^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Alden Lowell^Caer-Konig^Speak to the Speaker^^Use Auril's Tears to invest in Baerick's Iceforge in the Icewind Dale Campaign, then return tomorrow for more quests in Caer-Konig.^Baerick isn't the only business owner in Caer-Konig that is struggling to keep up with the surge in demand. Eglendar of the Hook, Line, and Sinker tavern can't seem to get enough mead up from Goodmead to keep his cellar stocked. Atenas Swift of Frozenfar Expeditions was expecting supplies from Easthaven, but pirates have been terrorizing the lake. They just need a partner to invest a little capital. No one here is going to go into business with a stranger. You've already earned Baerick's trust by your actions today, and the others will come around when your reputation for heroics improves. But lets not get ahead of ourselves. Let's help Baerick meet his demand first.
Don't Say His Name^70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Meet the Team^^Speak to The Artisan on The Master of Coin's behalf.^Ah Adventurer, your timing could not be better! Have you met The Artisan yet? New guy, over by the general store. I thought he seemed familiar, so I did a little digging. It turns out he's the famed... He's the famed artisan—drat, not in earshot of The Steward, Adventurer. I can't tell you his name—I wish I could—if only I could! His work is lauded the world over, he's established guilds in countless trades, everything he touches might as well turn to gold. And he's here! Right here. This is a gold mine, or it would be if he'd listen to a word I say. The mule insists he's just a bumpkin who's handy with a hammer. You lead a group of skilled artisans, maybe he'll listen to you. Convince him to put his skills to use beyond just mending fences and we could be set for life! 
Luskan's History^70^The Cleric^Stronghold^The Cleric^Stronghold^A Steward and His Mimic^The Great Detective^Speak with the Wandering Ghost and recover his lost treasures.^I've made some more progress in speaking with the ghosts that haunt our land. Mainly, I've found one whose goal isn't our total destruction. In fact, he was rather pleasant to speak to. He said something about a treasure of his being stolen and wanting it back. I think recovering stolen treasures is something that's more up your alley than mine.
Challenge: Skeletal Giant^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat the Skeletal Giant in the Stronghold.^Well, we've got a new variation of an old problem. Now, it's no longer hill giants attacking our buildings, but skeletal giants attacking our buildings. I guess I should be thankful it hasn't gotten any bigger! Could you please deal with this skeletal giant that's roaming around?
Into Mantol-Derith^70^Captain Belgold^Protector's Enclave^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^The Dwarven King^Ichor and Faerzress^Seek out Regis of The Grinning Ponies in Driftwood Tavern^<name>, that halfling fellow from the Grinning Ponies is back in Neverwinter, and he asked to speak with you in Driftwood Tavern. He wouldn't tell me what it was about, only that it was of, "the utmost importance". Would you do me a favor and inform him that I'm a Captain of the Neverwinter guard, not some errand boy?
Ichor and Faerzress^70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Into Mantol-Derith^Prophecy of Madness#The Prophecy of Madness^Speak to Grazilaxx, Ilren T'Serra and Mizrei Aldarunhel to learn more about the Underdark Campaign.^The first thing ye should be doin' is talkin' to this "mindflayer" named Grazilaxx. It was hard te trust a mindflayer, but he seems like he's keen on helpin' us find Demogorgon. Ye should also talk te some of the merchants left in this place. They're crazy enough te try to sell ye some gear in exchange for demon ichor. I donnae know why they're wantin' the parts, but I'll let ye be the judge of what they offer.
Surface World Problems^70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Prophecy of Madness#The Prophecy of Madness^Throne of the Dwarven Gods#The Throne of the Dwarven Gods^Speak with a Demon Hunter in Dread Ring, Caer-Konig, or Well of Dragons and complete their tasks. This quest will automatically complete if you have already done one of these quests.^Drizzt and I are gettin' closer to Demogorgon, I can feel it, <name>. Unfortunately, we found somethin' bad. Demogorgon's crazed cultists are openin' portals to the surface world and shuntin' the demons out there. I don't know what's goin' on up on the surface, but we need ye to go help 'em against the demons. There's no point in us defeatin' Demogorgon if demons are rampagin' on the surface.
To Slay a Demon Lord^70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Throne of the Dwarven Gods#The Throne of the Dwarven Gods^^Defeat Demogorgon. Requires 10 players. Demogorgon can be challenged at the top of every hour in Mantol-Derith.^We've found where Demogorgon is rampagin' and we got a plan. We're gonna lure the thing into a portal and have it come tumblin' out in a cave not too far from here. That's when ye and any of yer trusted friends are gonna help us banish the monster back to the Abyss. I hope yer ready, <name>, 'cause we're gonna kill a demon lord.
Wages of War^70^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^The Ashen Battlefield^Heart of Dread^Complete quests for the Neverwinter Vanguard Camp to collect Vanguard Scrips, then speak to Dell McCourt about spending it in the Dread Ring.^I can tell you're eager to get started, but destroying Valindra will be no easy thing. Our initial assault on the Dread Ring bought us this foothold, but the Thayans have been pushing back hard. It is all we can do each day to hold this position. Now that you're here, I hope that can change. You want to talk to Makos, Xuna, and Celeste about what quests need doing today. They'll likely have some coin to spare as a reward, but they'll pay you primarily in Vanguard Scrips. When you have some scrips, come back and I'll tell you how to use it. May Torm watch over you in this deadly place.
Heart of Dread^70^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Wages of War^Seizing Power, A New Day^Speak to Rath Modar in the Vanguard Camp, then assault the Dread Spire in the Dread Ring.^I have a dangerous mission for you. Within the vast tower known as the Dread Spire, Valindra's forces labor to complete a ritual to animate the skeleton of the long-dead dragon Lorragauth. We need you to halt those efforts. First, I want you to speak with Rath Modar. He claims to be a Red Wizard, but an exile opposed to Valindra and her master, Szass Tam. He knows much about the Thayans, the Dread Ring, and the powerful secrets that may be found here. Seek his council, but be careful. I do not fully trust him.
Seizing Power^70^Rath Modar^Dread Ring^Rath Modar^Dread Ring^Heart of Dread^^Use a Silver Gauntlet to open an Arcane Coffer in the Dread Spire.^Within the lairs of the Red Wizards in the Dread Ring, there are small portals to pockets within the Astral Plane - coffers, if you will. These coffers contain a wealth of artifacts, enchanted items, and secret knowledge unlike any elsewhere on Faerûn. I know how you might open one. I have in my possession a silver gauntlet, enchanted to reach into the Astral Plane and fetch back those riches. Once its magic is exhausted, the gauntlet will vanish, but you will have the treasure of the Arcane Coffer. There is one such Coffer in the Dread Spire. I hear Knox is sending you there already.
A New Day^70^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Heart of Dread^^Use Thayan Scrolls to Study Thayan Writings in the Dread Ring Campaign, then return tomorrow for more quests in the Dread Ring.^Thay has been at war with its neighbors since its inception. It is fair to say that mastering warfare has occupied the thoughts of the powerful minds of Thay for centuries. Scrolls describing spells, conditioning techniques, and methods of warfare have been amongst our most valuable acquisitions here. By collecting scrolls and using ciphers to study them, you might learn some of the Thayans' secrets. Why don't you try it?
The Zulkir of Illusion^70^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^^^Enter the Phantasmal Fortress and slay Baltreyo, Zulkir of Illusion.^Rath Modar has given us the name and location of Hlarkus Baltreyo, the Zulkir of Illusion - a member of the ruling council of Thay and a powerful ally to Valindra. He guards his phylactery jealously within his Phantasmal Fortress, for that is where his soul and his future rest. You must enter the City of Thay through the Portal. Under cover of night, head to the Phantasmal Fortress, just this side of Valindra's Tower. Baltreyo must be vanquished and his phylactery must also be destroyed to forever erase him from this plane and strike a blow to Valindra's plans.
Shatter^70^Xuna^Dread Ring^Xuna^Dread Ring^^^Assemble a Thayan Proof Token, then use it to destroy nearby Rich Onyx Deposits in the Quarry in the Dread Ring.^The Thayan undead army isn't something you can just fight head-on. You have to attack its supply lines. And in this case, that's the ritual components that the Thayans use to reanimate corpses. It's called black onyx, and the Thayans mine it in the Quarry to the east. The Red Wizards know how vulnerable their supply lines are here, and they put up magical barriers around any rich black onyx deposits the servitors dig up. You'll have to rough up some Thayans to put together a token that you can use to pierce the barriers. Once you have the token, just use this Rod of Shattering on the deposits to break 'em apart. Stop the Thayans from mining black onyx, and you stop the undead army.
Shadow Conjuration^70^Thalos Oathbreaker^Dread Ring^Thalos Oathbreaker^Dread Ring^^^Gather Prismatic Resonators from Thayans and disable Shadow Collectors in Underwing in the Dread Ring.^All Red Wizards are necromancers in addition to whatever other magic they study, and just like the Netherese they know how to draw power from the Shadowfell in order to augment their magics. To create their Shadowfell-influenced illusions, the Red Wizard illusionists collect Shadowfell energy in large Shadow Collectors, which they attune with trinkets they call 'prismatic resonators.' Our scouts have seen a Shadow Collector become unstable and overload when too many of these resonators are used on it at once. That's exactly what we need you to do -- collect resonators from the Thayans and use them to destroy their Shadow Collectors.
True Seeing^70^Harper Windle^Dread Ring^Harper Windle^Dread Ring^^^Collect Shadowfell Essence by destroying illusory creatures in Underwing in the Dread Ring.^There are many ways to craft illusions. The Red Wizard illusionists weave energy from the Shadowfell into their spells, infusing their phantasms with a powerful robustness. If we could unravel the rituals that they use to create them... When these physical phantasms are disrupted, they may leave behind a residue. If you could provide me with enough samples, I may be able to identify the exact spells the Thayans are using and research a way to counter them.
The Chamber of Horrors^70^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^^^Destroy Necromancy Components and slay Jawbone in the Death Forge.^The Death Forge is the infernal laboratory that churns out a nearly limitless supply of undead soldiers, headed by a half-orc necromancer named Jawbone.  This has to end!  Enter the Death forge, destroy their stockpiles of corpses, and kill the foul necromancer known as Jawbone!
Gentle Repose^70^Celeste^Dread Ring^Celeste^Dread Ring^^^Gather Necromantic Wards from Red Wizards and place them near piles of coffins in the Arsenal and the Quarry.^The Dread Ring is infected to the core. Whether from the Ring itself, from the cursed bones of Lorragauth, or from the Thayans themselves I know not, but dark magic is so pervasive here that I and the other clerics must spend a great deal of effort maintaining a protective barrier around our camp, lest the Vanguard becomes stricken with disease and malady. Yet, the Red Wizards within the Ring are still among the living. They protect themselves from the baleful influence by carrying protective wards. We can use those wards to hinder the Thayan undead creation engine. Take these protective wards from Red Wizards you encounter and place them near piles of coffins. That will prevent the bodies inside those coffins from being raised.
Silence^70^Xuna^Dread Ring^Xuna^Dread Ring^^^Slay Dread Hounds in the Quarry.^If our forces can take the Quarry, the Thayans will be in big trouble. They use the black onyx they mine there for necromantic rituals that fuel their undead armies. That's why the Thayans guard the Quarry with a savage weapon: Dread Hounds. Specially-trained howlers, augmented with Red Wizard magic. Our troops wouldn't stand a chance. To have a hope of successfully attacking the Quarry, the Dread Hounds need to be silenced. Raid that area and take out as many as you can find.
Undeath to Death^70^Makos^Dread Ring^Makos^Dread Ring^^^Slay Zombies and Skeletons in the Rib Cage.^The chief reason that the Neverwinter Vanguard is here is to stop Valindra's plans to raise the ancient black dragon, Lorragauth, as a dracolich. Even as we speak, hordes of undead are hard at work unearthing and piecing together the dragon's skeletal remains. We must do all that we can to hamper their efforts. The primary excavation site is within Lorragauth's rib cage. The area swarms with undead excavators. Go there and cut a swath through them in order to slow down their operation. The Thayans will just raise more corpses of course, but doing so will cost them time and resources, and as long as the Vanguard is here the Thayans have an infinite supply of neither.
Arcane Sight^70^Harpe Windle^Dread Ring^Harper Windle^Dread Ring^^^Dispel illusory walls and destroy the Supply Caches behind them in Underwing in the Dread Ring.^The Thayans never expected anyone to be able to breach the walls of the Dread Ring. Because of that, the inside of the Ring is poorly fortified and their supply caches are woefully undefended. The Red Wizard illusionists in Underwing stash their supplies in shallow caves and cast basic illusory walls to hide them. You'll find torches near these walls, and touching the torches will dispel the illusion. Get into those caves and destroy the Thayan supplies!
Hold Portal^70^Quorthon^Dread Ring^Quorthon^Dread Ring^^^Destroy Infernal Rifts in the Path of Torment in the Dread Ring.^In the Path of Torment, there are several rifts that connect to the Hells. The rifts are small enough so that only beings of minor power may traverse them, but they allow armies of imps to flood continuously into this world. No doubt this is part of the bargain that the Thayans made with their infernal allies. The rifts, luckily, are weak enough so that they may be collapsed by simply disrupting their physical form. You must go and close these rifts, or the number of imps in the Dread Ring may become too great for us to handle.
Contingency^70^Makos^Dread Ring^Makos^Dread Ring^^^In the Arsenal in the Dread Ring, obtain the three pieces of the Rod of Cancellation. Assemble the rod and use it to destroy the nearby Sphere of Annihilation.^The quest is currently bugged, the Red Wizards won't drop anything. The Red Wizard evokers have crafted a most powerful weapon -- a Sphere of Annihilation! Anything that touches the Sphere is instantly obliterated, which makes disposing of such a weapon very dangerous. The Red Wizards' contingency plan should the Sphere become too dangerous to contain is to destroy it with a Rod of Cancellation. The Rod is separated into three pieces. If you can assemble those pieces of the Rod and throw it into the Sphere, it will be destroyed in a catastrophic explosion! Ah... the containment apparatus the Thayans have constructed to hold the Sphere of Annihilation should contain the blast. I am confident that you will remain unharmed.
Dimensional Anchor^70^Quorthon^Dread Ring^Quorthon^Dread Ring^^^Gather Planar Residue from devils in the Path of Torment in the Dread Ring.^The mages of the Neverwinter Vanguard struggle constantly to counter the nefarious wizardry of the Thayans so that we may retain our foothold here in the Dread Ring. One way we do this is by disrupting the Red Wizard conjurers' attempts to summon further aid from the Nine Hells. You could greatly aid our disruptive efforts if you could bring us the residue left behind by any devils you defeat. As extra-planar beings, their remnants can be quite powerful when used as ritual components for summoning magics, or in this case, anti-summoning magics.
Slay Living^70^Captain Zemmer^Dread Ring^Captain Zemmer^Dread Ring^^^Slay Thayan Servitors in the Arsenal.^Not everything in the Dread Ring is undead, thankfully. Zombies don't sleep, don't eat, don't die easily, don't get scared, and don't stop single-mindedly following orders. That's just it though -- for a delicate task like maintaining the magical weapons stored in the Arsenal, the Thayans can't use clumsy undead. They need living, breathing, thinking people working on it. We need you to take on the Thayan Servitors in that area. They're exatly the living, breathing, thinking people I was just talking about, and we need to harry their operations to buy ourselves more time. Magical weapons are dangerous and need a lot of looking after. Without enough Servitors, the weapons will be in no shape to be used against us.
The Moonless Knight^70^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^^^Defeat Malabog's Black Knight, Celadaine in the Tower of Celadaine in the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^Celadaine... It is time for Malabog's Black Knight to face a reckoning. I sicken at the thought that I once called that traitor my friend. His betrayal has gone unadressed for too long. You will find him in the Fallen Tower overlooking the Outer Ward in the Realm of Malabog to the north. Slay him, and you will prove that outsiders may have a place in Sharandar after all.
The War Makers^70^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^^^Enter the redcap War Maker's camp and destroy the Siege Towers and Catapults they've built for Celadaine.^Celadaine has ordered the redcaps to build him war machines. Fortunately, our scouts have found the secret camp where the redcaps are building siege towers and catapults. Destroy these war machines before they can be used against New Sharandar!
Patching Things Up^70^Bressana Wildmaster^Sharandar^Bressana Wildmaster^Sharandar^^^Slay Redcap Thorns to collect Vital Sap and heal 3 Dryad-Tree Wounds in the Outer Ward of the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^Redcaps like to distill the vital sap from a dryad's tree into a potent beverage. More often than not, this means wounding the tree and sickening the dryad. If you come across any vital sap, you can apply it to the tree wounds and heal the dryads. Redcap Thorns often have sap on them. If you have to kill some redcaps to get it, so much the better.
Bearing Arms^70^Legaeth Songscythe^Sharandar^Legaeth Songscythe^Sharandar^^^Free 4 Sharandar Guardians from Greenvice Vines and arm them with Elven Swords in the High Cliffs of the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^Malabog's forces have been taking the Guardians of Sharandar captive, and feeding them to strange, carnivorous plants. Our people are trapped, unarmed, and soon to perish. Please, take weapons from our stores, bring them to the captive Guardians. Free them and arm them, and perhaps we can turn the tides on Malabog.
Eye for an Eye^70^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^^^Collect 6 Cyclops Eyes from Cyclopes in the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^The magic that empower the talismans we use to pass the gates requires a certain component- cyclops eyes.  I'll reward you for retrieving these eyes for us.
Calm and Assertive^70^Bressana Wildmaster^Sharandar^Bressana Wildmaster^Sharandar^^^Use Hound Bait to draw out and tame 3 Portal Hounds from their dens in the Hunting Grounds of the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^The damned redcaps have tempted my precious portal hounds back to a feral state. Well, two can play at that game. More, if one side employs intermediaries.  Take some of this delicious bait I've prepared and place it at a portal hound den, and the poor things should come running. They'll need reminding how to behave. Just a thwack on the nose and they'll remember their training.
Big, Bad, and Ugly^70^Legaeth Songscythe^Sharandar^Legaeth Songscythe^Sharandar^^^Slay 3 Fomorian Warriors in the Barbican Ruins of the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^The fomorian warriors in the Realm of Malabog are massive, dim, and pungent. Sadly, they are also battle-hardened, cunning, and multiply like rabbits. Every day, more appear in need of killing. I've long since lost hope of exterminating these warriors. It's all we can do to cull the ugly brutes. Slay a couple today and I'll reward you.
Mouths to Feed^70^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^Olirien Mistcrown^Sharandar^^^Collect 10 Edible Mushroom in the Realm of Malabog in Sharandar.^It takes a lot to keep an army strong. While the bounty of the Feywild keeps us fed, a mushroom that grows in the Realm of Malabog nourishes us particularly well. Fetch me some of these mushrooms and our warriors will fight stronger and braver for it. You can recognize the edible ones by the smaller, extremely toxic mushrooms that grow around them.
Ritual of the Dracolich^70^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^Sergeant Knox^Dread Ring^^^Destroy the research and slay the Knight Commander in the Dread Spire.^The cultists in the Dread Spire are once again attempting the dracolich ritual! Enter the Spire, put a stop to their research, and slay the Knight Commander that oversees them.
Unseen Servant^70^Florin Icehammer^Dread Ring^Florin Icehammer^Dread Ring^^^Collect Lorragauth Bone Fragments from undead excavators, then throw them into the Rock Grinder to draw out and defeat Praddak in the Rib Cage in the Dread Ring.^The Thayans are digging up this mighty large dragon, and that has to stop. I need you to destroy the overseer in charge of the dig, a wight named Praddak. Trouble is, Praddak is hard to find. Maybe he's shy. The Thayans have set up a big rock grinder at the excavation site to dispose of all the extra stone they dig up. I bet if you take the bone fragments from the undead excavators that are digging them up and toss them into the grinder, you could get Praddak to show his face. Then you destroy that undead pain in the arse and we all breathe a bit easier.
Planar Binding^70^Celeste^Dread Ring^Celeste^Dread Ring^^^Gather Infernal Ritual Components from Red Wizards in the Arsenal and the Quarry, then summon and kill the devil Sazohiel in the Dread Ring.^The Red Wizards have conjured and bound a powerful devil from the deepest Hells. This fiend goes by the name Sazohiel, and it uses its considerable power to work great evils against our forces. There is a summoning circle between the Scarred Pits and the Quarry that is set up to communicate with Sazohiel. If you gathered the right ritual components, you could force Sazohiel to manifest. Once he is in the flesh, so to speak, he can be slain. Will you do this for us?
Dismissal^70^Doomguide Soulhearth^Dread Ring^Doomguide Soulhearth^Dread Ring^^^Destroy Half-Finished Summoning Circles, then shatter the nearby Infernal Conjuration Focus in Path of Torment in the Dread Ring.^The last thing this battle needs are more damned devils. The Red Wizard Conjurers are creating more summoning circles in the Path of Torment as we speak, hoping to amass enough of the infernal creatures to overrun us. If we disrupt the rituals they're using to create these circles, we could hold out for at least another day. Take this Banishing Scroll and use it to disrupt the unfinished summoning circles, then destroy the Thayans' conjuration focus. That should slow them down.
Contact Other Plane^70^Quorthon^Dread Ring^Quorthon^Dread Ring^^^Gather Infernal Contracts from enemies in Path of Torment, then throw them into Conjuration Portals in the Dread Ring.^The Red Wizard conjurers depend heavily on the infernal powers with which they bargain. Each such bargain involves a contract. These contracts may be voided if they are ever passed back from this world into the Hells. I think you can see where this is going. The conjurers and their dread warriors carry these contracts. Seize the contracts and pass them through some of the many planar apertures in the Path of Torment. This will break their power.
Pyrotechnics^70^Captain Zemmer^Dread Ring^Captain Zemmer^Dread Ring^^^Collect 3 Crate of Blasting Stones and use them to collapse the Excavation Shaft in the Rib Cage in the Dread Ring.^The Red Wizards are always looking to solve their problems with magic. The evokers especially seem to enjoy showing off. In the excavation going on in the Rib Cage, the evokers have enchanted stones with explosive runes in order to clear away patches of hard rock. The items are simple enough so that even the mindless undead excavators can use them. This is our chance to use these Red Wizards' arrogance against them. If you gathered a couple entire crates of these stones and tossed them down the primary excavation shaft, I imagine it would set their operations back by a bit. Just remember to cover your ears when it goes off.
Dispel Magic^70^Harper Windle^Dread Ring^Harper Windle^Dread Ring^^^Slay Red Wizard Illusionists in Underwing.^IIlusionists are a crafty lot, using misdirection and deception to waste your strength fighting things that aren't real. But once you cut through the illusions, they have no defenses left. That's how we need to fight illusionists -- by going straight at them. Head to Underwing where they congregate and cut down as many Red Wizard Illusionists as you can find.
Prying Eyes^70^Captain Zemmer^Dread Ring^Captain Zemmer^Dread Ring^^^Place Scrying Orbs in specific locations of the Rib Cage to track the progress of the excavation in the Dread Ring.^Your friends in the Neverwinter Guard have an interesting take on battlefield intelligence. They've created these scrying orbs that should allow Makos, Quorthon and the other wizards to scry over the battle. As always, there's a catch. Someone has to get these things into position. There are arcane fonts all over the Rib Cage. You put one of these orbs on an arcane font like that, and its defensive wards will get all the power they need to hold of the Red Wizards and undead while we gather intelligence.
Needless Distractions^70^Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^Anara the Cerulean^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Raw Black Ice by mining Black Ice Deposits in Icewind Pass or the Dwarven Valley in Icewind Dale.^There is still too much we do not know about black ice. One thing we do know is it will be hard to research with perpetual barbarian raids and wild animal attacks interrupting our experiments. With so much unclaimed black ice in the wilderness, there is no hope for a peaceful and orderly research environment. Gather up as much of the black ice as you can find. Pry it from the rock, or from the hands of those corrupted by its influence. If there's less of it out there, perhaps we will see less interruption to our work. This substance is too important to be kept to a small corner of the world, after all.
Safe Keeping^70^Bowen Brant^Caer-Konig^Bowen Brant^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Raw Black Ice by mining Black Ice Deposits in Icewind Pass or the Dwarven Valley in Icewind Dale.^Black ice has been a mixed blessing for Caer-Konig. It brings more visitors and gold to our little town than anything we've ever seen before - but the problems it causes... Well, it's getting out of hand. What we really need around here is someone with a little backbone, someone who won't go crazy just carrying this stuff around, to go collect the stuff and get it out of the wilderness. If you could get out there, gather up any black ice you can find, either by mining it from a natural deposit or taking it from the unfortunate monstrosities that it has corrupted, I'd be very grateful, and I'm an awfully good person to have owing you a favor around here.
Frost Giant Moot^70^Flint Vreesh^Caer-Konig^Flint Vreesh^Caer-Konig^^^Barter passage into Kelvin's Cairn with the frost giant envoy Bael Thrymskald in Icewind Pass. south west part of the map.^The Arcane Brotherhood is pursuing its goals across the whole of Icewind Dale. Yet there are some places where even our great wizards cannot safely tread. Kelvin's Cairn, teeming as it is with fierce frost giants, is one such place. But where force fails, diplomacy may triumph. We have recently opened a dialog with an envoy of the Icereaver Clan in hopes of bartering passage through their territory. We would like you to take our latest proposal, along with this offering of enchanted mead, to the clan's skald, Bael Thrymskald. Knowing frost giants, he will likely ask you to prove your strength in some manner.
Lawful Salvage^70^Jubal Oakstaff^Caer-Konig^Jubal Oakstaff^Caer-Konig^^^Salvage Siege Parts from derelict siege engines in the Shattered Hollow of the Dwarven Valley.^The recent conflict between the Hammerstones and the Battlehammers in the Dwarven Valley escalated quickly before the Hammerstones drove their rivals out. They even employed siege engines, no doubt at the direction of Akar Kessell. I have seen enchantments on these siege engines that... perplex me.  The Brotherhood would like to study these enchantments. The representatives of Ten-Towns deny our right to remove them from the region, but Ten-Towns is not properly a nation. They have no sovereignty, for they have no sovereign. If you search the remains of the siege engines, I believe you will find gears that carry traces of the enchantments I mentioned. I assure you, it is all perfectly legal... so long as we can get them to Luskan before any local inquiry.
The Power of a Shaman^70^Grigoi Scrimshander^Caer-Konig^Grigoi Scrimshander^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Shaman's Staffs from Bear Tribe Shamans in Icewind Pass.^I may not be an Arcane Brotherhood wizard, but I still know the value of magic items! There's a fellow in Bryn Shander willing to pay a decent amount of coin for a few of the intricately carved staffs that Bear Tribe shamans use to focus their spells. Interested in making a few coin while helping to make Icewind Pass a bit safer for travelers?
Yeti Vendetta^70^Gurth Grimstalker^Caer-Konig^Gurth Grimstalker^Caer-Konig^^^Kill yeti rampagers and collect Yeti Horns in Icewind Pass.^Yeti killed Gurth's mother, when Gurth was knee-high to crag cat. Gurth does not forget! Gurth loved his mother. Blood for blood! Gurth will pay for yeti kills. Gurth track yeti through Icewind Pass. Yeti have caves in hills above bears. Bring back yeti horns so Gurth knows they are dead.
Atonement^70^Rory Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^Rory Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Troll Idols and destroy them in Moradin's Fire atop Bruenor's Climb in the Valley's Heart of Dwarven Valley.^The ice trolls in the Valley's Heart have raided our temples! They have turned relics holy to Moradin into grisly totems, defiling them with filth and primitive, profane worship. On the east wall of the Dwarven Valley, you'll find Bruenor's Climb, a steep, winding stair that leads to a perch overlooking the valley. At the top, there is a shrine to Moradin, the Dwarffather. Gather the grisly idols. Bring them to Moradin's shrine and burn them in his fire. It is my hope that the Soul Forger will take notice and forgive my clan for our sins and dereliction.
Strung Up^70^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^^^Remove Spoiled Meat from trees, then throw them into a fire in Daledrop Vale in Dwarven Valley.^Some unhinged individual is tacking up slabs of spoiled meat to trees in the Daledrop Vale! Smelling the rotting carrion, ice trolls come down from the hills to feast, and supplement their meals with living dwarves! Caer-Konig depends on goods we make in Dwarven Valley and transport through the Daledrop. If we can't keep that road safe, Caer-Konig will suffer. If you take down this grisly bait and burn it in a fire, I'll see you're well paid.
Lost on the Pass^70^Grigoi Scrimshander^Caer-Konig^Grigoi Scrimshander^Caer-Konig^^^Rescue Caravan Survivors and recover Knucklebone Trout Skulls from caravan wagons and around bear dens in Icewind Pass.^Traveling through Icewind Pass has always been dangerous, but it's gotten worse since that foul black ice started erupting! I was sending a shipment of knucklehead trout bones through Icewind Pass to the Elk Tribe. I received word that they never arrived at their destination, and I fear for the caravaners. Could you help find them, <name>? They're just innocent folk trying to make an honest living, and they don't deserve to die out there. If they got caught in the blizzard, they probably went seeking shelter. Oh, and if you find any of the knucklehead trout skulls, can you return them? No sense letting good scrimshaw material go to waste!
Caravan Documents^70^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^^^Search for Ten-Towns Crates and recover Ten Towns Documents from the frost giant caves at the peak of Biggrin's Rest in Icewind Pass.^During one of their raids, the Icereaver Clan managed to capture some very important documents, including transcripts that may finally prove the Arcane Brotherhood is in league with the frost giants. The documents were hidden in crates that were transporting animal specimins - spiders, chickens, and some stranger things - to a wizard's laboratory. I don't think the giants even know what they have! We think the giants took them to their lair on Biggrin's Rest in Icewind Pass. If you can find any of these documents before the Arcane Brotherhood recovers them, we'd be more than happy to compensate you for your efforts.
Maker's Mark^70^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^^^Recover Battlehammer Goods from abandoned wagons in the Daledrop Vale of Dwarven Valley, then load them into Stokely's Wagon in Caer-Konig.^Caer-Konig has relied on the Battlehammer clan for its goods for as long as we have been in the region. The mark of Battlehammer craftsmanship, a foaming mug of ale, commands a high price, and the local economy depends on our wares. When the troubles began in Dwarven Valley, we attempted to get as many of our wares to Caer-Konig as possible, but the corrupted dwarves and ice trolls forced us to abandon our wagons. As far as I know, they remain there in the Daledrop Vale, waiting for someone to reclaim them. Can you recover some of our goods and load them into my wagon? It will be of great help to both Caer-Konig and us dwarves in exile.
While They Are Young^70^Gurth Grimstalker^Caer-Konig^Gurth Grimstalker^Caer-Konig^^^Find freshly hatched young remorhazes and kill them on Dinneshere Shelf in Icewind Pass.^Remorhazes big worms, but start as little worms. Big worms hard to kill! Little worms much easier. Find little worms. Kill before they big enough to eat you whole.
Holed Up^70^Rory Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^Rory Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^^^Free captive Hammerstone dwarves by destroying the barricades blocking them in their homes in the Valley's Heart of Dwarven Valley.^Not all my kinfolk are corrupt, and of those who are not, not all made it to safety when we evacuated the Valley. Some are still holed up in the residences, barricaded in by the corrupted dwarves who now control the area. Please, free my kin and see them to safety. Our clan is nearly extinct, and we cannot afford any more loses.
Dwarf Stew^70^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^Stokely Silverstream^Caer-Konig^^^Rescue Battlehammer Dwarves from Troll Cauldrons in Daledrop Vale in Dwarven Valley.^Ice trolls have kidnapped my kinsfolk! To make matters worse, rumors say the trolls have taken to boiling captives alive. Something to do with the fear sweetening the meat, my scouts say.  We Battlehammer dwarves are few enough in number; we don't need trolls coming in and whittling us down further. Head to the Daledrop Vale in Dwarven Valley. Maybe you can save some of my dwarves, and if not, at least you can punish those vicious trolls.
Sleepwalkers^70^Kinnera Foxwood^Caer-Konig^Kinnera Foxwood^Caer-Konig^^^Find and wake Sleepwalkers in the Shattered Hollow of Dwarven Valley.^I fear that not all the black ice in Caer-Konig has been purified by Baerick's forge. Small amounts have made their way into the hands of our citizens, and I believe it has made them vulnerable to Kessell's influence. A handful of people have reported to me that they've woken up half way to Dwarven Valley, shaking free of a dream that they were marching to war. Even more people are missing, and I fear they are wandering towards the Shattered Hollow where Kessell waits to embrace them in his deathless service. Search the Hollow for Ten-Towners, and wake them from their slumber before it's too late. I must remain here and find out who is passing around this impure black ice. Doubtless, some Arcane Brotherhood lackey is behind this.
Lighting the Pass^70^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^^^Draw bile from the Dead Remorhaz near the yeti caves and use it light the Beacons along the Icewind Pass road.^The Icewind Pass is quite hazardous for travelers. Frequent blizzards have caused many a poor soul to be devoured by hungry beasts or die of exposure. The dwarves who settled the region established a series of beacons along the main road to guide travelers in foul weather. Marvelous as they are, these beacons need to be refueled from time to time. We've learned the fiery bile of a creature known as a remorhaz makes an excellent, long-burning fuel for the beacons. Luckily, a friendly Elk Tribe scout has reported a dead remorhaz in Icewind Pass. If you draw bile from the carcass, you can use it to refill the beacons. After filling a beacon, a simple push on the striker lever should ignite it.
Cursed Cairns^70^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^^^Consecrate Frost Giant Cairns and slay Undead Giants in Icewind Pass.^Icewind Pass is filled with cairns raised by frost giants over the dead of past battles. The Icereaver Clan has taken to leaving offerings of black ice beneath the stones of these cairns, and somehow this is causing the dead to rise! Undead giants have recently been spotted outside our town gates. We must put an end to this evil! As luck would have it, there is a priest of Kelemvor visiting the town. If anyone will know how to stop the undead, he will. Look for him in the Hook, Line and Sinker.
Maul of the Wild^70^Gurth Grimstalker^Caer-Konig^Gurth Grimstalker^Caer-Konig^^^Hunt Polar Bears, Dire Polar Bears, and Bear Riders in Icewind Pass and bring back Bear Claws as proof of your deed.^Bears in Icewind Pass always fierce and deadly, but black ice now making bears worse! Bears are full of rage. Bears wish to bite! Bears wish to crush! Bears wish to kill! Bears attack travelers in the pass. Many people killed. Locals ask Gurth to drive back bears, but Gurth only have two hands and one axe. Help Gurth kill bad bears! Bring back bear claws so I know how many you killed.
A Grim Warning^70^Grigoi Scrimshander^Caer-Konig^Grigoi Scrimshander^Caer-Konig^^^Capture Frost Giant Helmets and place them on poles near Frostmound Keep in Icewind Pass.^Something has to be done about the frost giants! Another merchant caravan has gone missing! And I swear I've seen some of the Arcane Brotherhood filth in possession of goods from that caravan.  I smell an evil alliance between wizards and giants!  I'm tired of losing good people and good merchandise to these brutes. If the only thing they understand is violence, we should send an appropriate message! Hunt down frost giants in Biggrin's Rest. Take their helmets and place them on posts outside Frostmound Keep. That will let them know there's a heavy price to be paid for attacking merchant caravans!
Weapons Raid^70^Flint Vreesh^Caer-Konig^Flint Vreesh^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Axes from Barbarian Raiders in Icewind Pass.^The weapons wielded by the barbarous warriors of the Bear Tribe are quite interesting. They seem to grant enhanced strength in battle, but not through any traditional form of arcane or divine magic. This leads us to believe black ice may be involved somehow. It seems improbable that these savages have discovered properties of the black ice that have eluded our best minds, but it might pay to explore the possibility. I want you to go out and capture several Bear Tribe axes. Best be on your guard however, those barbarians are not easily parted from their weapons.
Hunting Like the Wolf^70^Flint Vreesh^Caer-Konig^Flint Vreesh^Caer-Konig^^^Gather Pelts from winter wolves in Icewind Pass.^The winter wolves that range across Icewind Pass are known locally as "the Teeth of Auril" for their savagery and deadly frost breath. But the pelts of these beasts can be used to create enchanted cloaks that ward off the effects of even the most intense cold. Many of the Arcane Brotherhood members gathered here in Icewind Dale hail from much warmer climes, so winter wolf cloaks are in high demand among us. Alas, the enchantment soon wears out, consuming the pelt in the process - so there is a constant need for more. If you hunt winter wolves and bring us their pelts we will compensate you accordingly.
Bear Tribe at the Gates^70^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^Aelred Windsinger^Caer-Konig^^^Travel to Galebreak Divide in Icewind Pass to kill Bear Tribe Barbarians.^While we of the Ten-Towns have often made peace with the other Reghed tribesmen, the barbarians of the Bear Tribe have always refused such proposals, preferring to raid and pillage to get what they want. With the recent eruptions of black ice, their aggression has increased ten-fold. They are attacking anyone who dares to hazard the road through Icewind Pass. The barbarians must be quelled before they bring fire and sword to our very doorsteps! They are using Galebreak Divide in Icewind Pass as a staging area for their attacks. Go there and take the battle to them.
Picking Sides^70^Rory Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^Rory Hammerstone^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Hammerstone Picks from Mining Supplies or by killing Corrupted Dwarf Hammerers, then use them to jam Mining Mechanisms in the Valley's Heart of Dwarven Valley.^When we still thought the black ice was harmless, the Hammerstone dwarves used magic and machine to extract the stuff from the ground. Enchanted picks helped us dig, while complex assemblies of gears, levers, and winches hauled out the ice. We cannot let them continue to collect such a terrible and powerful material. Maybe you can solve two problems at once. Go to the Valley's Heart and collect as many of those enchanted picks as you can carry. Throw them into the mining mechanisms around there to jam up the gears. If they can't mine the stuff easily, maybe they'll give up.
Too Far Gone^70^Kinnera Foxwood^Caer-Konig^Kinnera Foxwood^Caer-Konig^^^Slay Corrupted Dwarves in the Dwarven Valley.^The dwarves of Dwarven Valley have been the allies of Ten-Towns for as long as any of us can remember, but those Hammerstone dwarves - the ones who've been mining the black ice - they are nothing like their old selves. They have become violent and cruel, and I fear that they are too far gone to save. The longer they are out there, serving whatever dark purpose that taints their souls, the more innocent lives will be lost. Slay those corrupted dwarves before all of Ten-Towns fall to their rage.
Dark Beauty^70^Jubal Oakstaff^Caer-Konig^Jubal Oakstaff^Caer-Konig^^^Collect Black Ice Jewelry by killing Corrupted Dwarves in the Dwarven Valley, then place them in a portal by Jubal Oakstaff in Caer-Konig for safe keeping.^When Baerick first began working with black ice, he made trinkets and jewelry for his clan. Many of the corrupted dwarves in the Dwarven Valley still carry these trinkets. If we learn the secrets of these objects, we may better understand what is happening in the Valley. Unfortunately, the only way you're going to be able to get your hands on that jewelry is to take it from a corrupted dwarf. I expect they'll put up a fight. Don't let that stop you, though. When you have enough, I'll open a pocket of extradimensional space where we can safely store these objects until we are prepared to examine them.
Plugging Holes^70^Kinnera Foxwood^Caer-Konig^Kinnera Foxwood^Caer-Konig^^^Find and collapse Hammerstone Mine Shafts in the Dwarven Valley.^The corrupted Hammerstone dwarves dig deep into the sides of the Dwarven Valley in search of black ice. A miner surrounded on all sides by black ice, breathing it in through the dust, will become irreversibly changed. You must collapse these passages. The Arcane Brotherhood would just send more fools into them get at their precious black ice, but the cost to the Ten-Towns would be too high. Bury the passages beneath rock and snow so they will never infect another soul. The corrupted dwarves will not be pleased, so stay alert.
Blessing of the Gods^10^The Speaker of Ao^Protector's Enclave^The Speaker of Ao^Protector's Enclave^^^Complete 5 Challenge of the Gods quests and return to the Speaker of Ao in Protector's Enclave.^The gods are good and reward those who answer the call and rise to their challenge.

The Great Detective^70^The Detective^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^Luskan's History^Armed and Ready^Travel to Protector's Enclave and recover a Thayan Tomb.^Good to see you again, Adventurer. I've been doing what I can to make up for working with that noble from Waterdeep. Do you remember Jundus? He is the man from Thay. The Sheriff and I have been investigating him and his family, and I think I discovered something that would break this mystery wide open. I have it on good authority that an artifact store in Neverwinter recently acquired a book detailing some inner workings on Thay.  If you could acquire it, I could look up information on Jundus and his family to see if they are part of the Red Wizards or just simple commoners.
Armed and Ready^70^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^The Great Detective^A Mother's Obsession, A Father's Love^Recover valuable pieces of gear from stronghold enemies.^I would say war is upon the Stronghold, but we've been fighting enemies since the day we started this venture. However, this Zulia woman is different. The Detective says that she is a very high ranking member of Thay, which means she has more resources than most. Several members of the team have stepped up to help fight Zulia. Unfortunately, the caravan with their new gear was raided along the way. We need your help to recover the gear that was lost. It might not seem like much, but we'll need all the help we can get against this threat.
Challenge: Iron Golem^70^The Builder^Stronghold^The Builder^Stronghold^^^Defeat the Iron Golem in the Stronghold.^The Thayans have been sending a particularly large Iron Golem after some of my workers. The disturbing thing is that it's not trying to kill the workers... the golem is trying to "kidnap" them. Luckily, all of the workers are safe, but I don't want to think about what twisted experiments the Thayans have in store for our people. Can you put a stop to this Iron Golem?
A Mother's Obsession, A Father's Love^70^The Steward^Stronghold^The Steward^Stronghold^Armed and Ready^^Defeat the Red Wizard, Zulia.^The time has come, Adventurer. The Ranger has spotted Zulia and her personal escorts. They're nearly upon Homestead. Zulia would destroy everything we've worked so hard to build, all to satisfy her mad desire to sacrifice her daughter to a lich. I won't allow it. The other members of the team are armed and ready.  Ride out to meet Zulia and show her that this Stronghold can withstand worse than her.
The Great Race: Whispering Caverns^70^Stable#Daily Stable Master^Stronghold^Stable Master^Stronghold^^^Complete a race in Whispering Caverns^Well, our well-funded but mysterious racing organization has yet another challenge, this time in the Whispering Caverns. I assume they're not Dark Elves or Duergar, based off of the location. Do you think you're prepared to race on behalf of the guild in the Whispering Caverns?

Demons are crawlin' outta the Chasm and inte Neverwinter. Linu already ran off te help 'em, so I guess ye better be on yer way te help her.

Howling Demons^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Defeat Targets in Icespire Peak or Pirates' Skyhold.^The Harpers are requestin' yer help in one of two places, dependin' on whichever one this mysterious letter says. They've got reports of demons attackin' Icespire Peak and Howling Hatred cultists infesting Pirates' Skyhold. I don't know which one they'll send ye off te, but perhaps you'll see me there too. I've been tryin' to help out while I can. Can't just sit back and get fat on me throne!
Big Trouble in Neverwinter^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Deal with Demonic Infestations somewhere in Neverwinter^We got word from the Lords' Alliance that demons and demonic cultists have been spotted prowlin' in Neverwinter. They need ye to go to specific locations and make sure they're no longer a problem. Pretty cut and dry. Do this and the Lords' Alliance can spare some more support fer Gauntlgrym.
Howling Through the Skyhold^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Rescue Sky Pirates from Howling Hatred Cultists in Pirates' Skyhold.^We got word from the Emerald Enclave that the Cult of the Howling Hatred has moved some of them cultists out of Spinward Rise and over te Pirates' Skyhold. Along the way, they took several of the sky pirates captive. Think they're part of somethin' called Company Yargo. I don't care much fer the sky, but the Emerald Enclave says the pirates are helpin' them fight the cultists. Think ye can help them? Rescue Sky Pirates from Howling Hatred Cultists in Pirates' Skyhold.

The Zhents say a drow archmage named Vizeran DeVir has been fightin' the demons and Baphomet. Unfortunately, no one knows where the blasted drow actually "lives". Yer Neverwinter friend, Makos, says he knows of a way to locate Vizeran. Talk to him in Mantol-Derith and see what he knows. If we can find Vizeran, we'll be one step closer to stoppin' Baphomet from usin' the Maze Engine.
Araj Tower^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Adventurers of the Lost Artifact^Interlude: The Legend Lives On^Travel to Araj Tower and meet with Vizeran DeVir.^Vizeran's location is in a place called Araj Tower, a few hundred miles away from the drow city, Menzoberranzan.

Demonic Siege^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Repel the Demon Army Attacking Neverwinter^The city of Neverwinter can't seem te catch a break. Neverember himself has asked for our aid. A whole horde o' demons showed up on Neverwinter's doorstep and are tryin' te get into the city. Ye'd think after yer work in the Chasm this wouldn't happen. Think ye can help Neverwinter?
The Will of the Gauntlet^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Repel Demons or Drow in the Chasm or Vellosk.^This time we got the Order of the Gauntlet askin' for our help.

Yer gonna need te get four elemental grimoires from the elemental cults, one o' each element, then yer gonna need te get the tome of some drow named Gromph Baenre. The Lords' Alliance got a hold of the fire grimoire back when we fought them cultists. They sent one of their men, Lucas Shaneway, te deliver it.

Turns out the Cult of the Crushin' Wave and the Cult of the Howlin' Hatred are havin' themselves a meetin' on the floatin' islands. Ye should make yer way up there, disrupt their meetin', and take their grimoires. Drizzt said he'd meet ye there and that he'd bring someone else along te help.
Reclaim the Rock^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Crashing the Cultists^A View of Menzoberranzan^Recover the Earth Grimoire in Reclamation Rock.^Ye won't be surprised when I say the earth grimoire is in Reclamation Rock. One of the Earth cultist generals, goes by the creative name o' Onyx, is holdin' on to the grimoire. Regis says the cult is launchin' an attack on the city in Helm's Hold, got a small army and everythin'. Nothin' that you can't handle, of course. We'd help ye, but the rest of us are tryin' to figure out how te find Gromph Baenre's grimoire.
A View of Menzoberranzan^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Reclaim the Rock^Mutual Agreements^Go to the drow Outpost and recover Gromph Baenre's Grimoire.^Gromph Baenre's grimoire is currently bein' held in an outpost near the drow city of Menzoberranzan. Drizzt scouted it and it's crawlin' with drow... enough that we need te play this safe. We acquired a scroll that'll disguise ye as a drow priestess. Yer gonna bring Drizzt in as yer "prisoner", get close to the grimoire, steal it, and walk outta there. Yer gonna have te do this fast before the drow figure out yer not a deranged drow priestess.

The drow said he'd let us know when he's done. I don't like not knowin' if he's goin' te betray us or not. In the meantime, we got a nice reward sent te ye from the factions for all yer help against the cultists. Why don't ye claim it?

He said there's somethin' bad in the air, some sorta psionic disruption. It's goin' to be lurin' a whole host o' demons here. Me, Drizzt, and Regis will get the regular folk here te safety. Ye should get yerself ready for when the demons arrive. Show 'em the door and see if ye can find the source of this psionic disruption.
Zhentarim Proposition^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Defeat Cultists in Mount Hotenow or Demons in Whispering Caverns.^We got an interestin' request from the Zhents, of all people. Seems like there's some demons in Whispering Caverns and cultists in Mount Hotenow that are hurtin' their business. Normally, I wouldn't care about the Zhents and their business, but we can't let these threats just walk around in the open. See if ye can go to one of these places and deal with the problem, me battleragers will take care of wherever ye don't go.
Rescue drow Slaves^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Rescue drow Slaves from the drow Outpost.^Ye remember the drow outpost ye took Gromph's book from?

Before we go te Baphomet, I was hopin' you'd help us in retakin' part o' Gauntlgrym, in the place where this whole thing started. We're gonna take back the bridge into the Underdark.

Make yer way to me throne as fast as possible, and prepare yerself.
Ballad of Baphomet^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Gauntlygrym Throne Room^The Horned King^^Listen to the Bard's Tale of your Fight with Baphomet^ Word of our exploits have reached the bards along the Sword Coast... and they're singin' "your" praises. They even got some people around Mantol-Derith talkin' about it. Why don't you listen to what they have te say about what ye did against Baphomet? As a warnin', bards have a habit of... changin' the way events actually happened.
Neverwinter's Need^59^Lieutenant Iivlin^Whispering Caverns^Captain Nessfettle^Whispering Caverns^^^Go to the Underdark Guide Stronghold in Whispering Caverns and defend it against the duergar.^<name>? Captain Nessfettle told me to keep an eye out for you. She's the Guardsman who you helped behind enemy lines in Helm's Hold. My name is Lieutenant Iivlin. Captain Nessfettle requests your assisstance guarding a Guild excavation of something very old. Dwarven it looks like. We've come under attack by duergar, but the captain's under direct orders to hold the excavation site. We need reliable warriors to help us out. I'm told you've worked in our temporary positions before. Are you interested in doing it again?
Size Doesn't Mean Everything^59^Oatley Faekin^Whispering Caverns^Oatley Faekin^Whispering Caverns^^^Take the boat located in the Verdant Caves to he Abandoned Tower in the Wispering Caverns and defeat the Necromancer.^So Tarley's halfling hero arrives... I jest, but truly I am glad you've come. Tarley wants us to hunt a Neverwinter noble-turned-necromancer who's fled down here to the Underdark. This necromancer business has got me all flustered. I've found his lair though. It looks like an old abandoned tower built onto one of the stalagmites in the lake. Very old, and no doubt brimming with secret paths and the like. You'll need to take a boat, but I took the precaution of getting one ready. I'll mark it on your map. Good luck!
Herbal Remedy^20^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Coast Guarding^Caravan Relief^Collect Gurglewort Sap in Drowned Shore.^Hail, <name>. I am Bellan Norrel, ranger of the Emerald Enclave, and I'm here to help with a particular problem - hunger. Our enemies have been bringing up fish from the sea to feed their soldiers and disrupting any attempts on our end to gather supplies. Even if we can defend this point, we'll eventually starve if something isn't done. There is a sap called gurglewort that can be extracted from local plants. Each vial could provide us with a filling, if somewhat tasteless, meal. Can you collect some of the sap and bring it to us?
Push Back^61^Udo Stoneskin^Drowned Shore^Udo Stoneskin^Drowned Shore^Coast Guarding^Caravan Relief, Dangerous Alliance^Kill Sea Trolls and Lizardfolk in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^These trolls and lizardfolk have disrupted my very profitable and quite honest (I assure you) mining business! I'm glad Neverember is taking this seriously and having an "adventurer" deal with this instead of his entire army! Look, if you want to make yourself useful, why don't you go kill the lizardfolk and trolls that are trying to push us out of here? If you can't tell, we're hanging on by a thread over here.
Caravan Relief^20^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Bellan Norell^Drowned Shore^Herbal Remedy^Cultist's Folly^Kill the lizardfolk shaman known as The Tidemaster in the Glimmerstone Mine located in the Mines region of Drowned Shore.^Dwelling deep within the mines is a lizardfolk shaman known as the Tidemaster. He has been directing the lizardfolk to thwart any of our attempts to recover supplies, be it from caravans, local villages, and even the nearby wilderness. This Tidemaster must be dealt with. If he is killed, it will disrupt the lizardfolk long enough for our supply routes to be opened back up. If we're better equipped, we won't have to rely on you to stick around and defend us. Not that I mind, of course.
Dangerous Alliance^20^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Coast Guarding^Boosting Dwarven Business^Kill hostile creatures in the Drowned Shore to recover a Mysterious Symbol then compare it to images in Yolander's Books.^Greetings. I am Alinda Greenwood, druid of the Emerald Enclave. I've noticed a strange symbol etched on items worn by these aquatic invaders. They seem to treasure this symbol. We need to know what it means if we're going to strike them. I'd like you to take a symbol from one of the aquatic humanoids and compare it to images in a book that once belonged to Yolander. He was killed by these invaders, and his book now rests somewhere in the nearby wilds.
Fuel on the Fire^61^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Alinda Greenwood^Drowned Shore^Caravan Relief, Dangerous Alliance^Cultist's Folly^Collect Olhydra's Emblems from hostile creatures in Drowned Shore.^We need to lure out the masters of these aquatic humanoids. The symbol you found indicates they worship Olhydra, which gives me an idea. I need you to recover more of these symbols. Return them to me, and I'll see them defaced and spread throughout the area. The cultists may not care about losing faceless monsters, but they "will" care about their "god" being insulted. In their anger, they'll make a mistake... and that is when we'll attack.
Boosting Dwarven Business^20^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^Udo Stonekin^Drowned Shore^Caravan Relief, Dangerous Alliance^Cultist's Folly^Gather Silver Ore from the Silver Drip Mine located in the Mines area of Drowned Shore.^Right before those soggy humanoids hit us we'd struck a nice vein of silver ore in Silver Drip Mine. That ore can be used to forge all manner of (very expensive) weapons and armor. We all know these beasts are working for the Cult of the Crushing Wave. There's enough ore in those mines to supply an entire "army" with weapons and armor. Can you bring me back at least some of the ore that's left? I'll make sure the ore gets in the hands of the Neverwinter army... for the right price, of course!
Cultist's Folly^20^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Flora Newleaf^Drowned Shore^Caravan Relief, Boosting Dwarven Business^War Machines^Enter Goldseeker's Folly in the Mines region of Drowned Shore and defeat Morgan Shivertimber.^Thank you for all your help, <name>. Our camp has been resupplied, the cult will lose its main source of ore, and you've angered the cultists by destroying their emblems. They've reacted by sending one of their 'top' cultists, Morgan Shivertimber, to eradicate us. Our rangers have spotted Shivertimber and a large group of cultists gathering in the mine known as Goldseeker's Folly. I'd like to see you confront this Shivertimber and see if you can find out any more information about the cult's activities.
Escape the Maze^60-70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Rescue Harper Wizards from the Abyssal Maze.^Drizzt was tellin' me how you and Linu escaped Baphomet's maze... well, I'm gonna have te ask ye te go back in. The Harpers are reportin' several of their wizards are trapped in that maze. When they heard ye made it out, they came askin' for yer help. They opened up a tear into the maze nearby for ye to go through. Ye think yer up for another trip to the Abyss?
Reporting In^20^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Life Guarding^Attack on Blackdagger Keep, Assaulting Blackdagger Keep^Gather reports from Rangers stationed around the High Road in Drowned Shore.^Good intelligence is a must if we are to be successful in our fight against the Crushing Wave. The Harpers and the Emerald Enclave have stationed some of our best rangers in key locations around the High Road to keep an eye on the activities of the cult and their allies. These rangers have been instructed to keep careful tallies of troop movements and numbers. I'd like you to collect their latest reports so we can determine how to best attack Blackdagger Keep.
Caravan Vengeance^20^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Worrisome Wares^Attack on Blackdagger Keep, Assaulting Blackdagger Keep^Kill Maelstrom, the Render, and Mossy Meg within Drowned Shore.^I lost more than goods and money when my caravan was attacked, I lost friends and associates. I'm only a traveling merchant, not some gallant knight, but I still want vengeance for this wrong. The leader of the raiders was a cultist they called Maelstrom. She was with two others, a hag called Mossy Meg and a creature called Render. Lanric has found the three locations where these three are wandering about. End them to ensure no one else experiences the pain of losing their friends.
Shifting the Numbers^62^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Lanric^Drowned Shore^Scaly Persuasion, Caravan Vengeance^Assaulting Blackdagger Keep^Recover stolen Merchant Wares from Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^Remember the merchant wares that we discovered the cultists stole? We need to recover them and "appropriate" them for ourselves. Don't worry, the Harpers will find the owners of these wares and pay them back for aiding our cause. Based off of our reports, you'll find these wares somewhere in Blackdagger Keep.
Assaulting Blackdagger Keep^20^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Reporting In, Caravan Vengeance^One Small Lead^Enter the Sea Hag's Hold at Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore and defeat Gar Shatterkeel.^Your work has weakened the cultists enough that we were able to discover a way in... which would be through the front door. Not exactly "stealthy", but we were able to acquire the key to unlock the door. Gar Shatterkeel should be in a section of the keep called Sea Hag's Hold. Bring him down and we'll be able to save Drowned Shore and go home.
Worrisome Wares^20^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^Ranolf Kemp^Drowned Shore^War Machines^Caravan Vengeance^Take stolen Trade Goods from hostile creatures around the High Road and within Blackdagger Keep in Drowned Shore.^<name>, my name is Ranolf Kemp, and I represent several trade associations. Or I did, until I was stranded in this mess. A cultist by the name of Maelstrom led an attack on my caravan and plundered all of my goods, not to mention killing nearly all of us! I barely escaped with my life. Please, you have to get those goods back from the cultists. They were meant to aid those fighting "against" the Crushing Wave!
Show of Force^20^Zhentarim Agent^Drowned Shore^Zhentarim Agent^Drowned Shore^Gutting Fish^Zhentarim Deal^Defeat Crushing Wave forces in the Drowned Shore.^These cultists still think they're better than the Zhentarim. Show them that the Zhentarim are not to be taken lightly, and I'll see that you're well rewarded.
Zhentarim Deal^20^Zhentarim Agent^Drowned Shore^Zhentarim Agent^Drowned Shore^Show of Force^^Defeat Crushing Wave forces in the Drowned Shore.^The powers that be still want to show these cultists that they don't belong in this area. I've been authorized to continue giving you a proper reward for all your work. Interested?
One Small Lead^20^Seven Toes^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Attack on Blackdagger Keep, Assaulting Blackdagger Keep^Archon Anarchy, Water in a Flask^Kill Crushing Wave Cultists in the Broken Crown Inn in Drowned Shore and learn what you can from Nora Brighton.^One of our agents, Nora Brighton, was supposed to be sending us reports while stationed at the Broken Crown Inn. Her last report mentioned the appearance of "sea elves". She should have sent us more information by now... I fear the cultists may have discovered her location. It's a stretch, but Nora might have the information we need to track Gar's next move. Go to the Broken Crown Inn and try to find Nora, or whatever might remain of her. I'd recommend taking the back entrance to catch the cultists by surprise.
Water in a Flask^20^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^One Small Lead^Slade the Thricedrowned, The Ravenous Host^Capture Enchanted Flasks from the Cult of the Crushing Wave.^The sea elves wanted me to recover several flasks that some of the cultists carry. I didn't think much of it, but now it makes sense. These all must be used in some sort of spell that they're concocting... but to "what" end, they won't tell me. Maybe if you recover one of these flasks from the cultists, the sea elves will be one step closer towards telling us what their main plan is.
Archon Anarchy^20^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Iolas^Drowned Shore^One Small Lead^Slade the Thricedrowned, The Ravenous Host^Destroy Water Elementals at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^Guard Harris has spoken to you about the Water Node. You should know what it is. The Water Node serves as a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. Olhydra, the evil Elemental Princess of Water, is sending water archons through the portal to aid the Cult of the Crushing Wave. Until we find a way to close the Water Node we will need to keep the number of archons in check. Destroy these invaders from another plane of existence. Show them they do not belong in our world.
Slade the Thricedrowned^20^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Archon Anarchy, Water in a Flask^No Room on the Shore^Kill the Crushing Wave cultist known as Slade the Thricedrowned at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^Slade the Thricedrowned. Three times now, the sea elves have drowned him, and three times he has returned, stronger than before. There is an aura of death around him... one that is hampering my magic. We are not strong enough to kill him in battle... but perhaps "you" are. Kill this Slade, once and for all. All will be revealed afterwards.
Combing for Secrets^63^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Guard Harris^Drowned Shore^Water in a Flask, Archon Anarchy^Sea Hag's Hold: Worse Than Death^Collect Salvage from Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^The sea elves have been making plenty of strange requests of me. I've done everything I can to help, but there's one that I just can't do. They want salvage from the nearby shipwrecks. When I ask them why, all they tell me is to be patient and wait for all to be revealed. That's the best reason I can give for asking you to go sifting for salvage in dangerous waters. Hopefully the sea elves will reveal their plan to us.
Taking Their Breath Away^63^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Iolas^Drowned Shore^Stolen Memories, The Ravenous Host^Crushing Gar Shatterkeel^Recover Necklaces of Air Breathing from Crushing Wave Cultists at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^My kin and I would not long be able to walk upon the land and breathe the air without magical aid. Those of us who undertook this mission were given Necklaces of Air Breathing. Such magic is truly rare among my people and losing one of these items is a great loss. I have seen several of the cultists carrying these necklaces, most likely stolen from my brethren who were killed. Recover the necklaces, and we can continue in our assault against Gar Shatterkeel.
No Room on the Shore^20^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Slade the Thricedrowned, The Ravenous Host^Crushing Gar Shatterkeel^Launch Sea Elf Warning Buoys from shore locations marked with ship's wheels at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore.^We are nearing the end of our fight against Gar Shatterkeel. We must warn other sea elves to stay away from the shore. Many of my kin have appeared to fight the cultists, and many have perished by their hands. I have prepared these magic buoys which will send out a signal to fellow sea elves, warning them to stay clear of this shore. They are attuned to the tides in this area and if launched from the proper location they will be carried to where they will be most effective. Will you take these down to the shore and set them adrift where you see the wheels? You will be preventing more of my kin from needlessly sacrificing their lives.
Crushing Gar Shatterkeel^20^Seychell^Drowned Shore^Seychell^Drowned Shore^No Room on the Shore^Seed of Water^Enter the Water Node at Raven Cliff Beach in Drowned Shore and defeat Gar Shatterkeel.^Everything is ready and the spell has been cast. Can you feel it? It is subtle, but you are now protected from the destruction of Gar Shatterkeel's water node. You must assault his lair and stop him from sacrificing one of our kin. Put an end to his menace, once and for all. Then, we sea elves can return to our homes and properly honor our fallen.
Delaying Ascension^20^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Captain Dunfield^Reclamation Rock^Toad Bait, In Memorial^Stolen Mementos, Stone by Stone^Recover Evidence of cult activity in the Crypt of Ascension.^While your work against the cult has pushed them back, we're still no closer to discovering the location of this Earth Node. My scouts report that the cult is still trying to dig tunnels in the nearby crypts. The difference this time is they were carrying orders on them. Captain Lynn and I believe these orders could help lead us to the Earth Node. I think the cult must be trying to connect the crypts to the Earth Node. We uncovered another entrance to the crypts nearby. Use it and recover any evidence you can find.
Stolen Mementos^20^Brother Thodosian^Reclamation Rock^Brother Thodosian^Reclamation Rock^Delaying Ascension^Black Earth, Stone Heart^Kill cultists to recover stolen Mementos.^The Cult of the Black Earth have taken to keeping mementos stolen from graves and tombs. Small trinkets of no tactical use, but of immense emotional value to all who fought against the Ashmadai. Recovering these mementos will be a great morale booster for all, and might discourage such trophy-taking in future.
Burning Sensation^65^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^The Fiery Pit^Crystal Coercion, Traitorous Scum^Collect venom from Bloodburn Scorpions in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit and bring it back to Grogbi Ironbeard to be used as a non-lethal poison.^The name's Grogbi Ironbeard, and I'm here to make sure these cultists don't get away with destroying my home. We'd like to capture some of the cultists alive to bring them in for interrogation to find out the location of our missing spy. One of our usual tactics is to extract the venom from a particular type of scorpion we like to call the bloodburn scorpion. Its venom won't kill you, but it'll make it feel like your blood's burning you from the inside out, so it's an effective non-lethal method of disabling someone. A little goes a long way, so could you bring me back some?
A Test for Gauntlgrym^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Mushroom Medic, Traitorous Scum, The Gauntlgrym Reports^Lights Out, Olgi Fren'Rah^Prove your knowledge to Captain Montrose in the Fiery Pit.^Look, I know a lot of you adventurers just skim over the reports instead of fully digesting them, so I'd like to reward those of you who do invest the time. Prove to me that you fully understand the reports, and I'll give you a little leg up in the fight ahead.
Extinguish the Fire^20^Harper Simmons^Fiery Pit^Harper Simmons^Fiery Pit^The Fiery Pit^Slow Burn^Defeat Cult of the Eternal Flame and Allies in Fiery Pit.^Hey there, adventurer. Up for doing some damage to Vanifer's cult? The Lords' Alliance has a long-term strategy against them, but me? I'm just looking to whittle down their numbers. Take down some of the cultists, and I'll see you're properly rewarded.
Saving Our Spy^65^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Traitorous Scum, Crystal Coercion^Connecting the Dots, Hostile Neighbors^Collect Cultist Plans in the Excavated Tomb in the Fiery Pit.^We have an issue with a missing spy, <name>. He is a duergar named Aldruk. Our scouts report that there are some cultists in a nearby tomb. They were carrying various scrolls with them that should have details regarding the cultist's next move. We need you to go to the tomb and recover these plans. Hopefully they will have details regarding Aldruk's location.
Olgi Fren'Rah^20^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^Grogbi Ironbeard^Fiery Pit^A Test for Gauntlgrym, Connecting the Dots, The Missing Spy^Filtered Information^Defeat the duergar, Olgi Fren'rah in the Mushroom Gardens in the Fiery Pit.^There's a duergar by the name of Olgi Fren'rah out there, who has been a thorn in our side for as long as I can remember. He takes delight in raiding our city and making off with our supplies. We've got some time before the duergar decipher the runes you found. Think you can take down Olgi?
Lights Out^20^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^Captain Montrose^Fiery Pit^A Test for Gauntlgrym, Connecting the Dots, The Missing Spy^Filtered Information^Rescue Aldruk from the Excavated Tomb in the Fiery Pit.^Your work with the Lords' Alliance and the dwarves of Gauntlgrym has paid off, <name>. We've found the location of our missing spy. Aldruk is being held within an excavated tomb nearby. I'll mark it on your map. This is a simple rescue. Get in there, carve a path through any cultists, and get out. Aldruk will give us our instructions, and perhaps then I can convince the local Zhentarim that their "help" won't be needed.
Controlled Inferno^20^Harper Simmons^Fiery Pit^Harper Simmons^Fiery Pit^Slow Burn^^Defeat Cult of the Eternal Flame and Allies in Fiery Pit.^The Lords' Alliance wants us to take one more sweep at the cultists and their allies. They say it'll help their agents gather more information about the cult's efforts. Up for one more attack against the cults?
The Spy Who Backstabbed Me^20^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Thannis Beke^Fiery Pit^Controlled Burn, Hot to Handle, Target: Singe^Commercial Interest^Free Miners and defeat Aldruk in the Excavated Tomb in the Fiery Pit.^Up for a little vengeance? Aldruk has been relocated, thanks to your work with the vents. He's now leading Vanifer's operations in the same tomb where he betrayed you. Coincidence, isn't it? Killing Aldruk will resolve our problem of Vanifer knowing every move the Lords' Alliance will make... and it'll send a clear message to other duergar "not" to cross us. Oh, and you should probably rescue the miners they've enslaved. Just watch out, some of them may not be as thankful as you'd like.
Never Betray a Lord^67^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Pillage First, Barrier to Entry^Angry Waters^Challenge and defeat the cultist strider rider, Captain Felcrest near the Water Pumps in the Fiery Pit.^There's word that a traitor to the Lords' Alliance rides with the enemy. Captain Felcrest was once a distinguished officer within the Lords' Alliance, but abandoned his post some years ago and slaughtered several good men on his way out. I always did wonder what happened to old Felcrest. Good of him to come out into the light and let us strike him down before he does anything "brash". Find him, challenge him, and bring him to justice.
Angry Waters^67^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Lucas Shaneway III^Fiery Pit^Never Betray a Lord, Sabotage^Financial Tracking, Slaves to Business^Defeat Enraged Water Archons in the Cistern in the Fiery Pit.^We've got word of a very... "strange" situation. Turns out a group of water elementals have turned against the cultists controlling them within a place called the Cistern. Ordinarily this would be good news, but I'm concerned the creatures' rage may pose a threat to everyone. Water always takes the path of least resistance, and if the creatures can't get at Vanifer, they will come rolling out of the Cistern in a wave of destruction. I know this sounds odd, but we'll need to stop these water elementals in the Cistern, or else the entirety of the Fiery Pit will end up a flooded mess!
Skyward War^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Trouble on the Winds^Air Supply, Learning to Fly, Target - North Wind^Meet Brokar Ironshod of the Riders of the West Wind, Harper Evandriel of the Harpers, Pirri the Swift of the Zhentarim, Skreel Swiftwing of the Sharptalon Flight, and Druid Okobo of the Emerald Enclave at the Foot of the Heavens in Spinward Rise.^We have been tracking the movements of the elemental cults since their "beacons" started appearing around the Sword Coast. The devastation that happened at the Drowned Shore was the first indication of their evil intent. While we were able to mobilize forces against the water, earth, and fire cults, it wasn't until recently that we found where the air cult was based.  We've gathered together people who would oppose the Cult of the Howling Hatred before they bring more destruction to our lands. They would like to speak with you as soon as you are able.
Learning to Fly^20^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Skyward War^Kenku Assault, Lovely Charms, Shiny Metal^Steal Elemental Air Devices and defeat Howling Hatred Cultists at the Glider Towers at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred is using strange devices to harness the power of elemental air. Such things are quite dangerous in the hands of the cultists, but with careful study we might be able to discern ways to use them against our enemies. We'd like you to acquire some of these elemental air devices for study. Our spies have seen the cultists practicing with these devices by the Glider Towers at Avia Landing. Head there, take out some cultists, and bring back some of those devices!
Target - North Wind^20^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Skyward War^Kenku Assault, Lovely Charms, Shiny Metal^Defeat North Wind at the Air Cult Roost at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^I hope you're ready to get your hands dirty. The Zhentarim are identifying key targets within the Cult of the Howling Hatred... targets that need to be eliminated if we're going to move forward. There's a member of the Howling Hatred known as North Wind. He helps recruit new members to the Cult of the Howling Hatred, and he's surprisingly persuasive. We need him dealt with.
Culling the Cultists^20^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Skyward War^Down to Earth^Defeat Cult of the Howling Hatred and Allies in Spinward Rise^You might be surprised to hear this, but the Zhentarim are in need of a few less cultists wandering around Spinward Rise. Interested in doing the job?
Target - Blackfeather^67^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Learning to Fly, Target - North Wind^Whispered Secrets^Kill Blackfeather in Foulclaw Woods at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Kenku are filthy animals, sneaking and stealing any scraps they can get hold of. There is one that's worse than the rest. Blackfeather has taken to assassinating people of our alliance. That will not do. Think of this as a... counter-assassination.
Flightless Fury^67^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Learning to Fly, Target - North Wind^Whispered Secrets^Defeat an Owlbear and Axebeaks around Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^So... I don't want to call this a personal vendetta... except it is. You see, when you do as much traveling as my fellow clerics and I, you're bound to run into some fearsome beasties wanting to eat you. Well, in my case, it was a herd of axebeaks! They came in out of nowhere and thought I'd be tasty. By Shaundakul's grace, I managed to outrun them, but not without a whole lot of grief! Oh, I was also mauled by an owlbear as a child. I don't want to talk about it. You'll find these beasties on the edges of Avia Landing. Avenge me!
Whispered Secrets^67^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Target - Blackfeather, Flightless Fury^Air Supply, Birds of a Feather^Collect Air Elemental Lore in the Air Cult Barracks located at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^We've got word that the cult is storing valuable lore regarding air elementals and the members of the cultist army in one of their barracks within Avia Landing. We could use some of that information to better coordinate our strikes. I'll mark the location of the barracks on your map, go there and recover any information you can find.
Birds of a Feather^67^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Whispered Secrets^Shiny Metal, Kenku Assault^Rescue Kenku Eggs from Foulclaw Woods at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Skreel Swiftwing has asked for help with the Kenku, earth-bound bird creatures. Aerisi lured many kenku into the Howling Hatred with the promise to let them fly again. She's lying, of course. Not all kenku were tricked. Unfortunately, those that were not had their eggs stolen by the kenku within Aerisi's cult. We're going to get those kenku eggs back to ensure a new generation of kenku are not raised by these air cultists.
Air Supply^20^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Skyward War^Kenku Assault, Lovely Charms, Shiny Metal^Sabotage the Air Balloons and Cult Supplies at the Balloon Docks at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^The Cult of the Howling Hatred is bringing in new recruits and supplies to Spinward Rise via their balloon docks at Avia Landing. This is a prime target for sabotage. Our spies tell us the supplies carry volatile alchemical reagants, which can be ignited. Likewise, from what we learned of elemental air devices, the balloons contain air elementals which can be released. Head over to the balloon docks, and start sabotaging the supplies and balloons!
Shiny Metal^20^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Air Supply, Learning to Fly, Target - North Wind^Twin Breezes^Defeat Kenku and recover Stolen Weapons from the Kenku Camp at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Skreel Swiftwing has let me know that the kenku have been stealing weapons made by his people. His... birds? Hrm... Anyway. The aarakocra's weapons are nearly depleted, which leaves us with an armed horde of kenku! We need you to weaken the kenku and get those weapons back. This will deal a large blow to Aerisi's army if you can pull it off.
Kenku Assault^20^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Air Supply, Learning to Fly, Target - North Wind^Twin Breezes^Defeat Kenku at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise. They are mainly found at the Kenku Camp and in Foulclaw Wood.^(Screech!)  Kenku make problems. Kenku steal weapons, supplies. Kenku kill our soldiers! Earth-bound go to Avia Landing. Kill kenku!
The Siege Begins^4-70^Siege Defense Coordinator^ Protector's Enclave^General Sabine^Siege Battlefield^^^Meet with General Sabine on the Siege Battlefield^The city of Neverwinter is under siege by the Cult of the Dragon. General Sabine has requested the aid of Neverwinter's adventurers to repel the Cult's army. Meet her on the Siege Battlefield to learn what you can do to help.
Lovely Charms^20^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Air Supply, Learning to Fly, Target - North Wind^Twin Breezes^Recover Aerisi Kalinoth Charms from Howling Hatred Cultists around Spinward Rise.^Marshal Rhaegos has identified two generals within Aerisi's cult, a brother and sister named Dashar and Silviria. We need to lure them out to strike them down. Silviria has been creating charms she claims to contain a lock of Aerisi's hair and distributing them amongst the cultists. I want you to steal a large number of these charms. Our goal is to anger Silviria and force her to reveal where she's hiding.
Beautiful Idols^67^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Shiny Metal, Kenku Assault^Twin Breezes^Recover Aerisi Kalinoth Idols from Skyweavers around Spinward Rise.^We've received reports about a brother and sister, Dashar and Silviria, who have quite a powerful influence over operations in Avia Landing. We need to lure the two of them out. Dashar has supposedly been creating idols that resemble Aerisi and distributing them to the cultist Skyweavers. I want you to recover these idols so that we can destroy them. My hope is that this will enrage Dashar and force him out into the open, where we can put him down.
Twin Breezes^20^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Kenku Assault, Lovely Charms, Shiny Metal^Riding the Winds^Recover Cult Battle Plans and defeat Dashar and Silviria in the Air Cult Barracks located at Avia Landing in Spinward Rise.^Dashar and Silviria have been lured out by our efforts! They just arrived at the Air Cult Barracks on Avia Landing. While you're there, please search the building to see if you can find any cult battle plans. It's always better if we can stay ahead of the game.
Down to Earth^20^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Culling the Cultists^Up in the Clouds^Defeat Cult of the Howling Hatred and Allies in Spinward Rise^The Zhentarim received some... "taunting" messages from Aerisi after your last attack. Seems like she doesn't understand not to cross us. Why don't we show Aerisi that she crossed the wrong group of people by taking down her little friends?
A Pledge of Support^4-70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^General Sabine^Siege Battlefield^^^Meet with General Sabine on the Siege Battlefield and pledge our support^Adventurer! I don't know if you've heard, but there's terrible news. Neverwinter is once again under siege by the Cult of the Dragon and Lord Neverember has requested the aid of all to repel the Cult's army. We can't ignore them in their time of need. You need to meet with General Sabine on the Siege Battlefield and let her know we are willing to stand and fight beside the people of Neverwinter in this battle.
Send Aid to Neverwinter^20-70^Master of Coin^Stronghold^Master of Coin^Stronghold^^^Recruit Stronghold Guards to lend support resisting the Siege of Neverwinter.^Adventurer, Neverwinter needs your help! The city is under siege and is requesting assistance from every quarter to fight back. While we cannot deplete our defenses too far, the Steward and I agreed that we can spare some guards to help fight for the freedom of Neverwinter. I'm sure we'll be amply compensated... not that money is the main concern, of course. Can you locate some able-bodied troops from around the stronghold and send them to Neverwinter?
Archon Anarchy (Windcall Temple)^68^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Riding the Winds^Clearing the Air^Defeat Air Archons at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise. They are found near the Elemental Air Portals.^Aerisi has responded to our attacks on the kenku. She has summoned air archons from the elemental plane of air to do her bidding in Windcall Temple! We need you to strike at these air archons and see what else she's summoning. If Aerisi can tap into the elemental plane of air, what other planes can she communicate with?
Windbreaker^20^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Riding the Winds^Call of the Slaadi, Hidden Messages, Order Out of Chaos^Use Black Earth to disrupt Elemental Air Portals at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The Howling Hatred calls to the Elemental Plane of Air, forcing the elementals who dwell there to come to our world. They are then bound by magic into service to the cult by the Skyseer warlocks.  The Howling Hatred only seeks to do evil with these elementals. The connection with the Elemental Plane of Air must be broken. I have enchanted a piece of Black Earth to seal the portals. Go to Windcall Temple, and use this Black Earth to disrupt the portals.
Target - Windshear^68^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Archon Anarchy, Windbreaker^Slaad Summoner^Kill Windshear near the Elemental Portals at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^Finally, someone reached Windcall Temple. I've got plenty of targets in there that could stand to stop breathing... or whatever air elementals do to survive. The air archons are militant creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. Many of them serve Yan-C-Bin, Prince of Evil Air. Windshear is a higher-ranking air archon, and has led many successful attacks against our allies. Take out Windshear at all costs!
Clearing the Air (Spinward Rise)^20^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Riding the Winds^Call of the Slaadi, Hidden Messages, Order Out of Chaos^Add Cleansing Incense to the Altar Braziers at the Altar of Yan-C-Bin at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^Near the highest point of Windcall Temple, there is an altar. It is here that the Howling Hatred cultists worship Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air. Yan-C-Bin does not care for worship, but the altar does act as a ritual focal point for gathering elemental air essence. If disrupted, it breaks the cultists' connection with the Elemental Plane of Air. Take this cleansing incense and go to the Altar of Yan-C-Bin. Add the incense to the braziers that burn there, cleansing the air of corrupted elemental energies.  Be careful though: the Howling Hatred is protective of their altar to Yan-C-Bin.
Slaad Summoner^68^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Clearing the Air, Target - Windshear^Fiends of Limbo, Unbound Anger^Close the Limbo Portals in the Howling Maw located at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^<name>, I assume you've seen the hordes of slaadi within Windcall Temple. The Zhentarim have discovered they're coming from a place called the Howling Maw. We need you to go to this place and destroy any portals you find. The cultists cannot get any more support, least of all from slaad.
Fiends of Limbo^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Riding the Winds^Call of the Slaadi, Hidden Messages, Order Out of Chaos^Slay Slaadi at the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The slaadi are creatures from Limbo who live only to kill and destroy. The Howling Hatred warlocks summoned these creatures and believe they control them. Perhaps they do, for now... but it is only a matter of time until they get out of control. We need you to kill the slaadi in Windcall Temple. We'll wittle Aerisi's army down, piece by piece.
Unbound Anger^68^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Druid Okobo^Spinward Rise^Slaad Summoner^Target - Glark the Rancid, Order Out of Chaos^Unleash Bound Air Elementals on their captors at the Binding Workshops at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The Howling Hatred cultists seek to become like the air they worship. They try to bend it to their will, summoning elementals of air and binding them into their magical devices. I hear the howling rage of these elementals carried on the wind. Air does not want to be bound, but to fly free. It is the nature of air. Go to the binding workshops the cultists use at Windcall Temple. Free the elementals from their binding, and they will seek vengeance on their captors.
Target - Glark the Rancid^68^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Fiends of Limbo, Unbound Anger^Call of the Slaadi, Hidden Messages^Kill Glark the Rancid near the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The slaadi are creatures from the dimension of Limbo. They are awful, chaotic creatures, living for death and destruction. Skyseer warlocks have been summoning them at Windcall Temple. Glark the Rancid is a particularly nasty slaad, and has been leading hordes of its kind against allied targets. Glark must be banished back to the plane of Limbo before it does more damage. You'll find it near the Pool of Chaos at Windcall Temple.
Order Out of Chaos^20^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Clear the Air, Fiends of Limbo, Windbreaker^Feeding the Slaadi^Gather Slaad Control Gems from Howling Hatred Cultists at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^Marshal Rhaegos would have us slaughter the slaadi to stop the cultists. While I'm not "against" the idea, I have an additional suggestion. The cultists can control the slaadi through control gems. I don't know how they acquired these gems, but losing them would mean they no longer control their monstrous "friends". Recover these gems from the cultists and we'll plunge Aerisi's army into chaos.
Call of the Slaadi^20^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Clear the Air, Fiends of Limbo, Windbreaker^Feeding the Slaadi^Recover Slaadi Summoning Tomes from cultists at Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^The Harpers have received word of several cultists receiving a tome detailing the summoning of slaadi. Marshal Rhaegos has a concern that the cultists have been up to something ever since we closed their limbo portals. Can you recover several of these tomes from the cultists? I'll read them over and see if I can confirm the concerns of Marshal Rhaegos.
Hidden Messages^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Clear the Air, Fiends of Limbo, Windbreaker^Feeding the Slaadi^Recover cultist scrolls around Windcall Temple in Spinward Rise.^I'm feeling uneasy about the slaad, <name>. I fear our destruction of their portals was too "easy". The Zhentarim have informed me that there are some scrolls that were recently delivered to camps throughout Windcall Temple. I want you to recover these scrolls and bring them to me. Hopefully my fears are for nothing, but I would prefer to be safe than sorry.

This Thurl Merosska must be the cultist's chief summoner, and he's planning on sacrificing their captives to appease the slaadi! Quickly, you must make your way to the Howling Maw, save the captives, and stop Thurl Merosska before it's too late!
Whispers on the Wind^20^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Higher Ground^Lofty Ideas, Scrying the Skies, The Cloud Forges^Gather Ciphered Messages from Howling Hatred Cultists at the Nimbus Courtyard at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^(Skreech!) Howling Hatred have much plans! Must know what they plan in Thunderhead. Cultists send secret messages. Must gather messages from cultists, give to others to decipher!
War Chests^20^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Higher Ground^Lofty Ideas, Scrying the Skies, The Cloud Forges^Recover War Chest Treasures from War Chests around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^To keep the Cult of the Howling Hatred going requires an enormous amount of treasure. They keep these in "war chests" in the upper regions of Spinward Rise.  Head to Thunderhead Reach and recover the treasures from these war chests.
Target - Grackel^69^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Whispers on the Wind, War Chests^Cloud Magic^Kill the owlbear Grackel at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^Let's see what we have on Thunderhead Reach... I assure you the Zhentarim has "much" information on the area. Hrm. Oh... Well... this might be why we don't have much information. A vicious owlbear named Grackel has been trained by the Cult of the Howling Hatred to sniff out our spies. This has to end! Head to Thunderhead Reach and take out Grackel.
Archon Anarchy (Thunderhead Reach)^69^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Whispers on the Wind, War Chests^Cloud Magic^Defeat Air Archons at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^Our reports indicate Aerisi hasn't changed her strategy in Thunderhead Reach. There are more air archons lurking on the island, waiting to strike. We should count ourselves lucky. I could only imagine what horrors she might try to tame after seeing the slaadi in Windcall Temple. Weaken whatever is left of her air archons, then return to me. We're forming our plan for the final attack on Aerisi.
Cloud Magic^69^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Archon Anarchy^Lofty Ideas, Giantslayer^Collect Air Magic Lore in Nimbus Tower located at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The magic of the cloud giants is strong. Through it they are able to make massive islands and castles float in the skies. In the hands of the Howling Hatred it would be a terrible weapon! We cannot allow the Howling Hatred to possess such knowledge. Seek out and collect air magic lore in the cloud giant stronghold at Nimbus Tower. The Emerald Enclave may be able to use it to counter the evil of the cults.
Lofty Ideas^20^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^Brokar Ironshod^Spinward Rise^War Chests, Whispers on the Wind, Giantslayer^Tempest in a Bottle^Gather Air Magic Scrolls from Cloud Giants around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^The cloud giants' knowledge of air magic is vast. You collected some of it within Nimbus Tower, but we could use more, especially if we want to go after Aerisi. Head to Thunderhead Reach and seek out the cloud giants who dwell there. Take their air magic scrolls!
Giantslayer^20^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Skreel Swiftwing^Spinward Rise^Higher Ground^Lofty Ideas, Scrying the Skies, The Cloud Forges^Slay Cloud Giants at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^(Screech!) Cloud giants come together very rarely. But air prophet very charismatic. She bring together large family of cloud giants here at Spinward Rise! Cloud giants help Howling Hatred with plans. Stop cloud giants, stop plans. Very simple! You go Thunderhead Reach, stop cloud giants!
Target - Rastari^69^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Giantslayer, Lofty Ideas^The Cloud Forges, Scrying the Skies^Kill the cloud giant Rastari at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^Rastari is a cloud giant talented with their special brand of air magic. He sometimes uses it to create a fog to disguise the movements of the Howling Hatred cultists. This cannot be allowed to continue. Rastari must be eliminated. Head to Thunderhead Reach and take care of him.
Eyes in the Sky^69^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Harper Evandriel^Spinward Rise^Giantslayer, Lofty Ideas^The Cloud Forges, Scrying the Skies^Gather Intelligence Reports from Howling Hatred Cultists around Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^We've managed to decipher the messages used by the Cult of the Howling Hatred, so they've become much more cautious on who they send them with. If we can get hold of this information, we can stay ahead of the cult. Head to Thunderhead Reach and gather their intelligence reports.
The Cloud Forges^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^War Chests, Whispers on the Wind, Giantslayer^Tempest in a Bottle^Slay the Cloud Giant Smiths working the forges around Nimbus Courtyard at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^We have reports that the cloud giants are making weapons to arm all of the Howling Hatred. They'll be able to re-arm the kenku, lure more sellswords with the promise of treasures... it means many terrible things for us. We need you to stop these cloud giant smiths before they can arm Aerisi's cult with giant-forged weapons!
Tempest in a Bottle^20^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Marshal Rhaegos^Spinward Rise^Lofty Ideas, Scrying the Skies, The Cloud Forges^Seed of Air^Stop the Devastation Orb Rituals and defeat Aerisi Kalinoth in Nimbus Tower located at Thunderhead Reach in Spinward Rise.^We know what the Howling Hatred cultists plan to do: they seek to drop their devastation orbs on targets across the Sword Coast. The destruction and death toll will be catastrophic! We've deciphered the cultists' messages and discovered Aerisi recently arrived at the top of Nimbus Tower. Brokar has devised a way for you to ride the winds up to the last level of the tower. Go to Nimbus Tower and stop Aerisi Kalinoth before she can enact her insane scheme!
The Seer^10-70^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^^Great Deeds^Speak to Sybella in the Vaults below the Temple of Tyr^A follower of Savras named Sybella has taken up residence in the library below the Temple of Tyr. She claims to be a seer. I don't know about that, but she is definitely a pest. She wants to speak to you in the worst way and has sent a constant stream of messengers reminding me to let you know that. If she can see the future, you'd think she could arrange to meet you herself.
Great Deeds^10-70^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^The Seer^Collecting the Past^Claim the Sleeping Dragon Bridge Deed^I am a follower of Savras, the All-Seeing. I have been granted the gift of the Third Eye, which allows me to peer into the future. I am working to perfect this gift, but for now my sight is imperfect and murky. The future is not certain and I catch glimpses of numerous, and often contradictory, events. The one thing I can say with some certainty is momentous events are coming to Neverwinter and the Sword Coast and you are a central figure in them. I have prepared a chronicle of one possible series of events. If you would look at this chart and confirm which events have actually transpired, it will help me sharpen my focus and discern the most likely course the future will take.
Collecting the Past^10-70^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Great Deeds^Assembling the Future^Collect Damaged Orb of the Seer ShardDamaged Orb of the Seer Shards from shattered orbs and orcs in the Tower District^Followers of Savras are not common. We tend to be fairly secretive and create our shrines in out-of-the-way libraries and scriptoriums. The reason I moved to such a public place is to seek help in locating the Staff of Savras. There was once a group known as the Benign Order of the Third Eye. They received a direct vision from Savras, instructing them to stockpile magic items and weaponry for a coming war with Cyric. My research shows some of those stockpiles may contain clues to the location of the staff. The problem is, locating the Order's caches requires a working scrying orb built by a member of the Order. There was a battle, massacre really, in what is now the Tower District. Members of the Order were attacked and wiped out by followers of Cyric. If you can find fragments of the seers' orbs and return them to me, we may be able to reassemble a working orb. Look for shattered orbs on the ground and check any orcs you defeat, as well. They do so love shiny objects.
Assembling the Future^10-70^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Collecting the Past^Searching the Present^Build a working Scrying Orb^Now that we have a supply of raw materials, we must see what can be salvaged and attempt to recreate one of the Order's orbs. This process may take some time, but I am confident we will succeed.
Searching the Present^20-70^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Sybella Artis^Protector's Enclave^Assembling the Future^^Recover Order Documents in Blackdagger Keep^Now that we have a... Functioning... Orb, it should be possible to locate some of the Order's hidden caches. The magic items once stockpiled in them are long gone, but I'm sure there will be documents left behind and they may contain clues to the location of the Staff of Savras. I'm tempted to tell you the locations of some of the caches, having seen you find them in the future, but I fear foreknowledge may invalidate my visions. I will give you a hint, though. Look near the Blackdagger Keep.
A Reward in the Garden^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Enter the Protector's Garden and get your reward.^Well, it's been quite a day, hasn't it? I think you deserve something for your efforts, and I've set aside a little something for you up in the Protector's Garden. You should also take a look around the place while you're up there. Continue to help me out, and I may be able to put in a good word with the city and secure you continued access to it once the Protector's Jubilee ends.
Message for the Tower District^10-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Drop Elminster's message into the old well in the Tower District.^I have an important message I need delivered to an associate here in Neverwinter. My instructions may seem strange, but I want you to drop the message into an old well located in the Tower District. You needn't fear, my associate will find the message, I assure you.
Speak to Alla^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to the Harper Agent Alla in the Moonstone Mask^I need you to speak with a Harper Agent located right here in the city. Her name is Alla and you will find her at the Moonstone Mask. Listen carefully to any message she asks you to bring to me.
Message for Lanric^20-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to the Harper Agent Lanric in the Broken Crown Tavern in Blackdagger Ruin^I know a trusty Harper who strives to contain the bandits and pirates infesting the roads leading north from Neverwinter. I have important information to convey to him. Take this coded message to the Broken Crown Inn. You should find our man waiting for you there. He goes by the name of Lanric.
Beachcombing^20-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Find Lost Maps washed ashore from a shipwreck in Blackdagger Ruins.^Another ship has been lured onto the rocks by bandits in Blackdagger Ruins. Worse still, this one was carrying an associate of mine who had among his baggage a series of maps and charts that took many months to compile. Not only are our allies deprived of the vital information recorded on these maps, but should the maps fall into the wrong hands our enemies will be aware of what we know. I ask thee to travel to the Blackdagger Ruins and search the shores of Raven Cliff Beach for a crate containing the maps. We must find them before the bandits do.
An Unlikely Spy^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Old Jerry in the Blacklake District.^I am eager to know what plots are stirring among Neverwinter's criminal underworld during these unsettled times. There is a certain Harper who works tirelessly to foil the plots of Neverwinter's criminal gangs. Under cover of feigned madness he moves as if invisible among the seedy elements of the Blacklake District. Pay this man a visit and learn what he has to report. His true name must remain a secret, but those few who notice him at all refer to him as Old Jerry.
A Warning for Bilgewater^42-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Bilgewater in Tragold's Camp on Pirate Skyhold.^Are you familiar with Skyships? Only a few of these great magical works remain, making them an invaluable resource in the right hands. This also means they are a threat to those that plot against us. I would send a message to the privateers of Company Yargo but I fear that my words would fall on deaf ears among those sky-sailing rogues. Fortunately there is one among the crew who might be more receptive, a former Harper who renounced his allegiance on less then amiable terms. He goes by the unfortunate alias of Bilgewater these days. Seek him out on Pirate Skyhold and give him this warning.
Message in a Bottle^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Find the coded message left in a bottle in the Blacklake District.^I have an agent working in the Blacklake District who is deeply involved with the gangs that infest that neighborhood. To avoid being seen talking to the wrong people, my agent communicates solely by leaving coded messages in unlikely places throughout the district. Please head over to Blacklake and search amid the trash and slime of the old canal for a message hidden in a discarded bottle. Bring me that message.
A Fate Unknown^26-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Search a newly opened grave in Neverdeath Graveyard for evidence of who was buried there.^Many years ago a friend of mine vanished while on a mission near Neverwinter. I never knew what became of her and that has always weighed heavily on my mind. Quite by chance, I recently discovered a notation in the city records that leads me to believe my friend perished on her quest and was buried in Neverdeath Graveyard. Ordinarily I would never disturb a grave, but I am told that portion of Neverdeath has been plundered by necromancers. Please investigate the gravesite. Perhaps you can find some clue as to who was buried there.
Taking up the Gauntlet^35-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Assist the Order of the Gauntlet priest Loban Nightshield in Ebon Downs^The Order of the Gauntlet is a new organization composed of paladins and clerics of Tyr, Helm, Torm and Hoar. They have banded together to make common cause against the evils besetting the world. The Order would be a powerful ally in the struggle ahead, so it would be wise to foster good relations with them. I understand that a member of the Order, Loban Nightshield, is currently striving against dark forces in the Ebon Downs. Travel there and offer Loban your aid. Complete any task he might have for you and then return to me here.
Rat Scratchings^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Capture a Dead Rats Coded Message and place it in the designated crate in the Blacklake District.^The Dead Rats are a despicable gang, willing to ally themselves with any cause that promises profit. Neverwinter can ill-afford to have such a force operating within its walls. The Harpers are working against the Rats in the Blacklake District, but they are hindered by an inability to decipher the gang's code. Fortunately an expert has been found who can crack the code once provided with a good sample. Go to Blacklake, capture a coded message from one of the Dead Rats, and then place it in a certain old crate, in Lakeside. The Harpers will find it there.
Message for Windle^26-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to the Harper Windle in Neverdeath Graveyard^There is a Harper here in Neverwinter who is very closely tied to the upcoming crisis. Perhaps you know her? Her name is Windle. I'd like ye to speak with her. Mayhaps she has discovered something valuable among the bones and stones of the graveyard.
Concerns for the Chasm^49-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Jess Eastwalker at Fort Precipice in the Chasm^I am gravely concerned for Neverwinter's future, especially with the unknown threats of the Chasm lurking just beyond Protector's Enclave. The city's defenders must be able to face an outside threat without fear of another enemy rising behind them. I have a friend, Jess Eastwalker, who serves among the spellscarred soldiers of Scar Company. Seek him out at Fort Precipice and get a report on the current situation in the Chasm.
Fallen Harper^31-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Recover the Harper Pin of a Harper slain in battle at Helm's Hold^I have received sad news, my friend. A valiant Harper has fallen in battle with diabolical forces at Helm's Hold. As a Harper in good standing this poor fellow possessed a Harper pin - a silver broach that identifies the bearer as a member of the Harper order. It would not do for this pin to fall into the hands of an enemy who might use it to infiltrate the Harpers. I charge thee, travel to Helm's Hold and search the battlefield there for our fallen ally. Find his Harper pin and return it to me.
To a Harper's Aid^52-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Free the Harper Ermo Cleftstone from drow slavers in Rothé Valley.^The Harpers have urgent need of your services, <name>! I have received word that drow slavers have captured one of our agents in Rothé Valley. Ermo Cleftstone is a good Harper, and we will have need of all good Harpers soon. Travel to Rothé Valley, find Ermo and free him from captivity
Sign of the Arrow^20-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Place a warning sign at Ranger Camps in Blackdagger Ruins.^Are you familiar with the Emerald Enclave? They consist mostly of druids and rangers dedicated to helping others survive in the wildness. We must alert their agents in the North of the danger ahead. Enclave rangers have recently arrived in the vicinity of the Blackdagger Ruins to guide trade caravans crossing that bandit-infested region. You needn't track down the rangers themselves. You can spread the word by using their warning signal: a pair of crossed arrows. Simply locate a few ranger camps and place this signal. Rangers who see your warning will make contact with the Harpers or others who can enlighten them.
Leaving Notes^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Hide Elminster's Note under debris in the basement of the Driftwood Tavern.^There are heroes who walk on the... shadier side of the law. Many balk at their methods, but no one can argue with their results. I know one such hero who operates in this very city, and I have a message to convey to him. Unfortunately, it would likely be a death sentence for him to be seen speaking with me. Fortunately this dilemma can be solved with the simple expedient of a coded message. Run this note over to the Driftwood Tavern and bury it beneath a pile of debris in the basement. My associate will find it there.
Snowed Under^46-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Recover Harper Documents from a satchel hidden in the snows of Icespire Peak^I have received word from Harper agents working near Icespire Peak. They tell of one of our spies who stumbled into their camp suffering from terrible wounds. Before the poor fellow passed he revealed that he buried a satchel of important documents in the snows of Prospector Ridge in a desperate attempt to keep them from falling into enemy hands. I need you to find that satchel and bring the documents to me.
Taking Notes^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Find the tome "Principles of Thaumaturgic Transmogrification" in the Sage Shop and transcribe the notes written within.^I would very much like to examine a certain tome which can be found in Brodda's Sage Shop, here in Neverwinter. The problem is I don't want anyone to know that I am interested in it. Actually I'm not really interested in the text so much as I am certain notes written in the margins of this ancient work. I would like you to go to the Sage Shop and find a book entitled Principles of Thaumaturgic Transmogrification. Carefully copy the scribbled notes found on page 238, and bring your transcription back to me. If you haven't been to the Sage Shop before you may find it a bit confusing, but persevere and you will find the book you seek. It is located on the second floor I believe.
Conspiracy Theory^32^Image of Dyrl Godsword^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^^A Subtle Infection^Help Brother Satarin investigate the Ashmadai Conspiracy in Helm's Hold^In this blasted land, a deep infection festered. Devils dwelt alongside the innocent, and whispers planned invasion. Now fire rages, but the kindling remains secret. A righteous man seeks the truth, but unaided will remain blind.... Helm's Hold. This place was once peaceful and beautiful. A refuge for the dispossessed. Now the Ashmadai and their bound devils rule here. But there is one here who seeks to know how this happened so quickly, so suddenly, and perhaps, if possible, bring justice to those responsible. Seek Brother Satarin, aid him in his quest, and you will win the approval of the gods.
A Subtle Infection^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Conspiracy Theory^The Carrying Hand^Defeat Branded Zealots to find Evidence of Conspiracy in Scar Alley in Helm's Hold^I have a nagging feeling that there was something, before the invasion, something happening just under my nose. You're an adventurer, right? Maybe you'll help me scratch this itch. If there was something going on here before the invasion, some conspiracy, those responsible should be punished. I've seen some familiar faces among the Branded Zealots of the Ashmadai. If you rough up enough of those zealots, you might discover a lead that would help us find the collaborators. If you come across any evidence of conspiracy, bring it to me and we'll figure out what to do next.
The Carrying Hand^32^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^Brother Satarin^Helm's Hold^A Subtle Infection^^Locate and interrogate the Ashmadai Courier in Scar Alley in Helm's Hold^M. V. could be anyone. There was a small slip attached to this with instructions to deliver this letter to the Prophet Rohini. I don't think the zealot you received this from could be the courier. Seems beneath the Prophet. I've asked around, and I think I know where the courier is hiding. You'll have to flush him out, but I don't think that will be a problem. The rumor is that he's ready to bolt. Or fight. Visit the courier's house in Scar Alley. See if you can get him to answer our little riddle.
A Dim Augury^40^Image of Dyrl Godsword^Vellosk^Oracle of the Moon^Vellosk^^Shades of Meaning^Help the Oracle of the Moon pierce a veil of shadows in Vellosk^Shadows flit between the trees of Neverwinter Wood, and Selûne's light cannot pierce them. The eye of a servant of Silver is blinded and the Moonmaiden is muted by the dark. The looming shadow stretches toward the wounded city, giving cover to the creeping doom. Behind this point where you see me, the Oracle of the Moon struggles to see Selûne's plan for her. The Shadar-Kai spread Shar's influence, darkening all visions. This diviner needs your help. Render her the aid she seeks in vanquishing Shar's darkness from this wood, and the gods will continue to bless you.
Shades of Meaning^40^Oracle of the Moon^Vellosk^Oracle of the Moon^Vellosk^A Dim Augury^ Dire Omens^Defeat 3 Shadovar Emissaries in the Gray Wolf Battle Camp in Vellosk^Are you here to help me preserve this forest and its people from the taint of shadow? Yes, you have been the missing piece. East of here, agents of the Mistress of Night are working the will of dark forces. These Shadovar Emissaries are the waves of a rising tide that will  engulf not just these woods but the Coast of Swords as well. As you are the agent of destiny, I ask you to be Selûne's levee. Hold back this tide of shadow. Kill the Shadovar Emissaries. When you are done, I will share with you Selûne's wisdom.
Dire Omens^41^Oracle of the Moon^Vellosk^Oracle of the Moon^Vellosk^Shades of Meaning^^Acquire a Direhelm's Helmet by slaying a Direhelm in the Twilight Reach in Vellosk^The Shadow has parted, but the darkness still looms in my vision. If I am to glimpse what is to come, I will need a potent focus. To the north of here, in a region bathed in the dark of Shar, there dwell Direhelms, beings of shadow and malice. A helmet from such a creature would allow me to pierce the veil of dark. Bring me the helmet of a Direhelm, and I will see clearly what I must do to purge these woods of the shadow taint. 
A Misguided Hand^59^Aralynn the Pious^Protector's Enclave^Aralynn the Pious^Protector's Enclave^^^Confront Dyrl Godsword in his home in the Protector's Enclave^My friend, I have distressing news. Sergeant Knox has been investigating Dyrl Godsword. I'm afraid he doesn't like what he's found. Many of Godsword's followers have gone missing, and a few days ago, one turned up dead. Worse, the soul of the deceased follower is not reachable by Kelemvor's Doomguides. Dyrl Godsword has some very dark hobbies indeed. We know you've been in contact with Godsword, with the best of intentions, I'm sure. We need you to confront the false oracle and put a stop to his schemes. his home is here in the Protector's Enclave. Good luck.
Assigning Blame^8^Cloaked Man^Blacklake District^Cloaked Man^Blacklake District^^Rebel Rousting^Enter the Dead Rats safe house, kill all the Dead Rats within and plant evidence to lay the blame on the Nashers.^This was once one of the most populous areas of Neverwinter City. Now, it's a lawless ruin plagued by Nashers and Dead Rats. My employer would like people to move back into the District, but before that can happen we'll have to get rid of the gangs. Two gangs is an easy problem to solve - we just have to get them to fight with one another. I want you to raid a nearby Dead Rats lair, kill every wererat in the place and drops this Nasher Propaganda pamphlet in a conspicuous place. That should stir things up a bit.
Ignoble Duty^59^Hubert Windcastle^Whispering Caverns^Hubert Windcastle^Whispering Caverns^^^Rescue the Lise Elmheart, Brunne Elmheart, Vars Elmheart and Gillian Elmheart from the Drow Villa^Welcome friend! It is I, Hubert Windcastle in the flesh. I am so sorry a more competent agent could not be sent. I may have perhaps offered some small insult to one of Lord Neverember's guests at table. As a result, my employment is now contingent on your mission ending in complete success! Never let it be said that the Lord Protector is ungracious. Most aides would not get a second chance... To that end, kindly follow this map to what I believe to be some kind of Drow estate. You should find some enslaved nobles there. Free them, if you please. 
Mercantile Missions^70^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Complete Ostaram's Mercantile Daily. Fight for the River District.^My fellow merchants have requested assistance in the River District. I think you would be splendidly suited for this. If you would undertake these tasks for me on a regular basis I would be most grateful. But don't neglect helping Neverember in the struggle for this district. After all, should he lose, we all lose.
The Departed^70^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Retrieve the loved ones remains from a crypt^A merchant friend of mine is concerned a relative's remains may be disturbed by all the excavation in the River District. Retrieve the remains from the crypt for reinterment in Neverdeath. Unfortunately he cannot recollect the location of this crypt so you must search for it.
Regenerating Raiders^70^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^^^Kill 25 Ice Trolls^The ice trolls continue to be a threat to the town despite the heavy casualties that have suffered. I supposed that's always going to be the case against an enemy that can regenerate their injuries. The next time you enter the Lonelywood, could you thin their ranks some more? And try not to let the wounded escape.
Scouting Party^70^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^^^Defeat the Frost Giant Scouts.^Orders dropped by the enemy reveal that a powerful frost giant scouting party is in the area. Defeating this group would prevent the frost giants of learning how vulnerable Lonelywood is.
Recasting Alarm^70^Kavatos Stormeye^Sea of Moving Ice^Kavatos Stormeye^Sea of Moving Ice^^^Reactivate Alarm Spells in the Sea of Moving Ice.^The frost giants have no consideration for others! Sorry, I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but this is in reference to the alarm spells you activated for me. All the giants going to and fro in their longships have exhausted the charges on some of the totems. I need you to go back out there and refresh the depleted spells.
Gyrion the Ascendant^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Defeating Gyrion^Return to the Plague Tower^Defeat Servants of Gyrion. Use orbs to collect magical energy.^Of all the wizards we are up against, Gyrion seems to have been most affected by the energies of the Spellplague and the Far Realm. In order to penetrate his portal defenses I need details about his minions. I also need samples of the energies flowing through his portal. You are adept at bashing skulls, so I propose you retrieve those samples and get a look at Gyrion's servants at the same time. Take these orbs and activate them at the locations I have marked
Return to the Plague Tower^70^Sergeant Hawthidon^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Gyrion the Ascendant^^Go to the Plague Tower and perform the infusion ritual.^You can thank me later, but i convinced Kavatos that spellscarring you was probably not the best method to get you through Gyrion's portal. Although, I'm not sure the alternative he came up with is much better. He wants to use those collection orbs of his in reverse to create an aura of Spellplague energy around you. The process needs to be done in an area with Spellplague energy, but not too much, because it could fry you. That rules out the Chasm or tapping directly into Gyrion's portal. The best option is looking like the ruins of the Plague Tower. This is a two-person job, so I'm going with you.
Twisted Fey^70^Archdruid Morningdawn^Protector's Enclave^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Nostura of the Stone Eye^^Go to the Lynching Tree and determine the source of Nostura's power.^The essences you brought to me are not those of normal fey creatures. Something has warped and twisted them. I fear Nostura has broken her original pact with the Archfey and is now working with some power. The only way to determine the new source of her power is to go to a place where nature has become as twisted as her minions. There I can work a ritual using these essences and possibly catch a glimpse of her new master. The only place I can think of nearby that might yield results is the Lynching Tree in Neverdeath. Will you accompany me there?
Mercantile Boost^70^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^^^Recover Lost Supplies from Enemies in Bryn Shander.^Bryn Shander is running low on supplies. We have plenty of supplies strewn outside on the tundra, but they're being stolen by any number of things that want to see the city fall. Recover any supplies you can find on barbarians or even beasts and bring them back here. We won't survive much longer without them.
Eggs for Food^70^Xuna^Bryn Shander^Xuna^Bryn Shander^^^Recover remorhaz eggs within Bryn Shander.^We've got a remorhaz problem in Bryn Shander. Word is that remorhaz eggs have been found throughout the city... as if the remorhaz are trying to make the place their nest. Seems like everyone wants a piece of Bryn Shander. I happen to know remorhaz eggs can fetch a very nice sum with the right trader. That money could do a lot of good up here; why don't we pick up a few and see if the town could use them?
Mercantile Woes^70^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^^^Recover merchant wares in the outskirts of Bryn Shander.^Do you remember rescuing the merchant goods near the knucklehead camp? Well, there's still some wares laying about that we could use for firewood. People are complaining that their supplies are running low. Could you go out and recover what you can in the tundra?
Hunting the Yeti^70^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^^^Defeat the Wandering Abominable Snow Yeti.^I don't know where these damn yeti keep coming from, but they just won't stop. The guards have been chased away from the wall from a particularly nasty yeti. The beast seems like it enjoys toying with us. Hunt down the yeti and slay it. We'll arrange the fur and bones as a warning sign to any other predators.
Knucklehead Recovery^70^Xuna^Bryn Shander^Xuna^Bryn Shander^^^Recover Knuckleheads from Enemies in Bryn Shander.^Know much about knuckleheads? Neither do I, but I guess the big festival up here was centered around them. People up in the Dales seem to put a lot of value in the item, and it just so happens that our local invading force decided to take said knuckleheads. Why don't you go get some back? It should help increase morale around here... at least it'll remind people of a time when the town wasn't frozen solid.
Caravan Distress^70^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^^^Rescue trapped merchants in Bryn Shander.^We have an issue where several folks have tried to recover goods from the lost caravans on the outskirts of town, only to get cornered and trapped by the beasts lurking in the area. The Dale might be survival of the fittest, but we need every able-bodied person to keep Bryn Shander going. Can you rescue the people stuck in these caravans?
Wolf Clearing^70^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^^^Lure out and defeat beasts in Bryn Shander.^We've got a beast problem within Bryn Shander. Wolves and bears keep making their way inside the city.  The guards are working on finding where they're getting in, but I need you to work on getting them out. I want you to take these pieces of meat and throw them on the road in parts of the city. That should lure out any of the beasts and let you do your job.
Beastly Deeds^70^Xuna^Bryn Shander^Xuna^Bryn Shander^^^Defeat Beasts and Yetis in Bryn Shander.^Notice all the beasts roaming around in and outside the city? People in Bryn Shander are talking about how the city is being overrun by the monsters. Let's show them that the city can still be saved by putting a dent in the local animal population. All for a good cause.
Guard Duty^70^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^^^Get guards out of their homes within Bryn Shander.^Duvessa Shane has issued an order that all guards must report for extended duty along the walls. Some of the guards are trying to ignore their responsibility... I know that because I was one of the guards. Could you go to their homes and get them out? Just keep in mind they're afraid and worn out... but work to defend our town needs to continue.
Fighting Barbarians^70^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^Markham Southwell^Bryn Shander^^^Lure out and defeat barbarians outside of Bryn Shander.^We've got problems with barbarians trying to claim Bryn Shander as their new home. This is nothing new, we've been fighting barbarians off since before I was born, but now there's a real threat that we might lose Bryn Shander. Go out there and burn any barbarian totems you see. That should lure out a few of them. Take them down and show them Bryn Shander won't fall. Not now. Not ever.
Playing Support^70^Xuna^Bryn Shander^Xuna^Bryn Shander^^^Save Bryn Shander Guards from invading barbarians.^The name of the game is saving guards from barbarians today. The Bryn Shander guards are trying to fend off invading barbarians in the outskirts of the city. Why don't you walk over there and give them a hand? It could improve morale, and the number of guards that survive, to have an adventurer down there taking down groups of barbarians.
Barbaric Advance^70^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^^^Defeat Barbarians or Frost Goblins in Bryn Shander.^I've been doing some scouting along the wall and I saw more and more barbarians gathering on the outskirts of Bryn Shander. To my surprise there were also frost goblins who, I fear, are working with the frost giants. Maybe the giants want to make sure Bryn Shander is well and truly destroyed... but why not finish the job themselves? It would help us if you can deplete the ranks of barbarians and goblins attacking the city, maybe even give the guards a moment's rest.
River District Unveiling^70^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^^^Attend the River District Opening Ceremony.^<name>, impeccable timing. I am holding a ceremony to commemorate the re-opening of the River District, an important step in returning life in Neverwinter to normal. The proceedings will be dedicated to Makos and I want you to be there. I can think of no one better to represent his legacy of selfless heroism. Kavatos and I are departing shortly, I look forward to seeing you at the ceremony.
A Crown for the King^70^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^^^Check on the Crown of Neverwinter within the Hall of Justice Vaults.^Kavatos insists the crown is still safe, but I want to see it for myself and you're coming with me. There are glyphs around the crown that should prevent anyone who isn't me from retrieving it, a gift from Makos before he departed to the north. Kavatos will stay here and work with Xuna on finding any further information about this Cloaked Ascendancy.
Going Undercover^70^Kavatos Stormeye^Protector's Enclave^Kavatos Stormeye^Protector's Enclave^^^Alter your appearance at the Tower of Alteration, then sneak into the Ascendant Headquarters in Blacklake District.^I'm glad Neverember confirmed that I'm not an idiot and can do my job properly. Let's get to work, shall we? I've received information that a large number of potential recruits for this Cloaked Ascendancy are gathering in the Nashers' old hideout in the Blacklake District. Supposedly, the major wizards of the Ascendancy will also be there. Speak with Lady Jyllian in the Tower of Alteration to alter your appearance, sneak into their hideout and look for evidence of Gyrion's true goal.
The Missing Link^70^Kavatos Stormeye^Protector's Enclave^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^^Speak to Sage Bradda to translate the Spellplague Scroll.^Hmph... this scroll is proving difficult to translate, I haven't dealt with plaguechanged magic. I've been informed about a woman named Sage Bradda. She might be able to help decipher this scroll. See if this sage can tell you what the scroll says. I'll be looking into problems that are starting to crop up in the River District.
Reclamation Specialists^70^Incriminating Documents^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Collect incriminating documents from adventurers.^You have found incriminating documents. They show some of Neverwinter's less patient merchants are not waiting to get their cut of the riches taken from River District. They have hired adventurers to sneak into the area and grab the shiniest loot for themselves. Look for other groups of adventurers in the River District and recover more documents.
Hidden Cache^70^Stencil Cipher^River District^^River District^^^Decipher the markers and find the hidden cache.^You've found a piece of parchment with an odd pattern of holes cut in it. It looks as if it might be the key to a stencil cipher. Notes scrawled along one edge are directions to an encoded trail marker. Follow the directions and locate what this cipher is hiding.
Secure the Area^70^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Kill enemies in the designated area.^A merchant friend of mine would like to visit his property in person. However, he is fearful of the many hostile creatures in the River District. His bodyguard will accompany him on the visit, but he would feel better if someone with your reputation cleared the area first. This letter contains the details.
Magic Recovery^70^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Retrieve Heirloom Magic from a dungeon vault^A merchant friend of mine left behind some valuable magic items when he made his escape from the River District many years ago. Look for these magic items in the estate dungeon. Unfortunately he cannot pinpoint the exact location of the dungeon so you must search for it.
Heirloom Weapons^70^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Retrieve Heirloom Weapons from a Sewer^A merchant friend of mine lost some valuable weapons as he made his escape from the River District through the sewers many years ago. Look for these weapons in the sewers. Unfortunately he cannot recall the exact location of the sewer so you must search for it.
Family Heirlooms^70^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^Ostaram Copperwise^River District^^^Search the River District for Family Heirlooms^Many families left behind items of little monetary worth but tremendous sentimental value. I have received a list of these items. If you happen upon one while scouting the River District, I would be grateful if you could recover it.
Defeating Nostura^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^River District^^^Discover the information needed to defeat Nostura.^The members of the Cloaked Ascendancy are too powerful to take on as a group. We will need to divide and conquer if we wish to defeat them. To do that we need to learn more about them. What were their past connections to Neverwinter? Do they have any weaknesses? How do their minions operate? Aside from that brain-addled illusionist Lukan, Nostura's sanity appears to have suffered the most during the Ascendancy's time in the Far Realm. I suggest caution while investigating her background.
The Dead and Defeated^70^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Ascendancy's End^River District Hauntings^Meet Sergeant Knox in the Driftwood Tavern in Protector's Enclave.^Ah, <name>! Always good to see you, my friend! There's something important we should discuss. But... not here. Let's meet upstairs at the Driftwood Tavern. We can get a drink. Trust me, you might need one after what I have to tell you...
River District Hauntings^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^The Dead and Defeated^The Crypt of Shadows^Slay Wraiths around the River District, then investigate one of the Crypt Dig Sites there.^We've got wraiths all over the River District, and a massive shadowy tower hanging over us. The two are likely related, but the tower is out of phase with the Prime Material Plane and we have no means to enter it. Let's begin with the wraith problem. Unfortunately that half-wit Lukan can't remember where he opened the chamber to release the wraiths. And so it falls to us. The wraiths seem to be be concentrated mostly on the Riverfront area closest to the wall, lurking in secluded areas - back alleys and dead ends. What's more, workers have reported wraiths coming out of crypt dig sites around the district. It's time for you to perform more of your heroics: slay the wraiths around the River District before they run rampant, then investigate one of the crypt dig sites to find the source of this problem.
The Crypt of Shadows^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^River District Hauntings^Necromancer Consultancy^Find crypt location from Quartermaster Kendricks, then investigate the Crypt of Shadows in the River District.^We've got a better idea now of who we're after and where to look. I suggest we start searching for this shadowy Kelemvorite crypt as soon as possible. Quartermaster Kendricks has been coordinating activities with the workers around the River District. He can probably give you the best lead on where to find this crypt.
Necromancer Consultancy^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Zarifrax's Phylactery^^The Crypt of Shadows^Death Wizards^Meet with Doomguide Soulhearth in Ebon Downs.^We need to find a way to enter the Shard of Night to stop Morlanth and the Netherese from raising an army of wraiths. If Morlanth has retreated to Evernight, we must follow her there. What's Evernight? I know very little, only snippets gleaned from the lore of the Arcane Brotherhood. It exists in the Shadowfell, a Plane of Shadow that is a dark reflection of the Material Plane in which we live. Evernight is a twisted reflection of the city of Neverwinter, populated by the undead, shadowtouched, and mortals with unsavory predilictions. The ways to reach Evernight are unknown to me. But there are those whose purpose is to seek out and destroy the undead. I speak of the followers of Kelemvor. Meet with Doomguide Soulhearth at the temple in Ebon Downs and ask his advice.
The Shard of Night^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Descent into Shadow^^Use the Key of Night to enter the Shadow Portal into the Shard of Night in the River District. Defeat Morlanth and recover the Shroud of Souls.^I've identified a convergence of necromantic energies in the River District. This is where the veil between the Prime Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow is at its weakest. Go there and use the Key of Night to enter the Shard of Night. End the threat of Morlanth and her wraith army!
Behind the Mask^70^Kavatos Stormeye, Abolethic Portal Stone^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^^Stop Gyrion's Ritual within his Place of Power^All that is left is for you to assault Gyrion's tower. I'll be joining you to ensure you have support if he tries to pull any tricks. Once you're inside, I'll simply use a teleport spell to whisk myself to your location.
The Fey Castle^70^Kavatos Stormeye, Fey Portal Stone^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^^Stop Nostura's Ritual within Her Place of Power^I have looked into the issue. I can get you past Nostura's defenses and into her demi-plane within the Fey Realm. I have no idea what you'll find on the other side. But I'm sure you'll figure it out. Good luck.
Trial of Iron and Fire^70^Kavatos Stormeye, Fireforged Portal Stone^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^^Stop Kabal's Ritual within His Place of Power^I have completed the potion you need to invade Kabal's realm. From what I've heard, he uses the demi-plane as a training ground to turn those frail Nashers into Eldritch Knights. Well? What are you waiting for? Stop Kabal! ... Oh, you need the potion first. Yes, here it is. Now, go!
Supplying the Defense^10-70^Defense Supply Master^Protector's Enclave^Defense Supply Master^Protector's Enclave^^^Donate Defense Supplies to the defense of Neverwinter.^Between the siege itself and the refugees who've sought safety here in Neverwinter, the city is sorely pressed for supplies. Lord Neverember has asked for all citizens to donate as they are able to help the defense effort. Any supply packages you craft can be donated to me and I'll make sure you're rewarded.  
Protector's Bounty^6-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Defend Foreign Merchants as they make their way to the festivities at Protector's Enclave.^Neverwinter's Jubilee and Lord Neverember's promise of protection during the festivites has encouraged foreign merchants to make their way to the city. You can earn the Protector's Bounty by finding the Foreign Merchants and protecting them as they travel to Neverwinter.
Rendezvous with Riff^10-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Riff at the Fallen Tower Tavern in the Tower District.^It pays to keep tabs on the savage tribes of the Spine of the World since it is there that many powerful evil-doers recruit their followers. I have a friend who has spent a good deal of time in those mountains and who has... Well, a unique insight into the ways of the tribes. She is currently visiting Neverwinter where she seems to be most comfortable in the Fallen Tower Tavern in the Tower District. Go there and ask her what news she has from the Spine of the World.
Law and the Order^31-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to Sir Godwyn Trent in the Old Dirty Dwarf tavern in Helm's Hold.^A new force for good has arisen on the Sword Coast. The priests and paladins of the Order of the Gauntlet have dedicated themselves to striking at evil wherever it appears. I intend to win the aid of that order in the upcoming conflict, and I would like you to act as my messenger. The Order is headquartered in Waterdeep, but you needn't travel so far. You can currently find Sir Godwyn Trent, a paladin of the Order, at Helm's Hold. Ask Sir Godwyn to relay my request for a meeting to Kleef Kenric, the founder of the Order.
Death and Diplomacy^10-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Recover a Diplomatic Courier's Satchel from a slain Zhentarim courier in the Tower District.^We were expecting a diplomatic courier from the Zhentarim... Yes, I'm afraid that times are growing dark enough to justify dealing with those ruthless mercenaries. For some reason the fool attempted to enter the city through the Tower District - perhaps some attempt at double-dealing with the Many-Arrows orcs. It seems the orcs were unimpressed however, and they slew the courier. We've learned from inebriated orcs in the Fallen Tower tavern that the courier's body still lies in the Many-Arrows camp. It is unlikely the orcs would take any interest in the documents he carried, but they are still of value to us. Search for the corpse and recover his diplomatic satchel.
Question for Oran^38-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^^Speak to the Harper Agent Oran at the Sacred Pool in Vellosk^The Harpers have an agent living among the barbarous Forsworn in wild Vellosk. Oran is his name, and his task is to live among the tribesman, learn their ways and gain their trust. The Forsworn are fierce fighters and their aid would be most welcome in the struggle ahead. Seek out Oran and ask him if we can count on such aid.
Dark Tidings^70^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Captain Dunmish^River District - Docks^^Heart of Darkness^Speak with the Mysterious Man within Helm's Hold Cathedral.^Adventurer! There is a grave matter that is unfolding within Helm's Hold. We received reports from Brother Satarin that people who are decaying have shown up on their door step. Furthermore, there is a mysterious man who has a letter for you, but is too weak to reach Neverwinter. Satarin offered to mail the letter, but the man insisted on handing it to you in person. Can you go investigate what's happening at the cathedral?
Welcome to Port Nyanzaru^70^^Port Nyanzaru^Minsc^Port Nyanzaru^Heart of Darkness^Hunter's Square^Meet Minsc at expedition compound in Port Nyanzaru in Chult.^After arriving in Port Nyanzaru, it is time to meet up with Minsc at the Expedition Compound in Port Nyanzaru in Chult.
Hunter's Square^70^Minsc^Port Nyanzaru^Volothamp Geddarm^Port Nyanzaru^Welcome to Port Nyanzaru^Prince of Chult^Meet Volo at Hunter's Square in Port Nyanzaru in Chult.^You'll be happy to know that funny little Volo fellow survived as well!

Prince of Chult^70^Volothamp Geddarm^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Hunter's Square^Run Through the Jungle^Meet Wakanga O'tamu at the Merchant Princes' Villa in Port Nyanzaru in Chult.^In helping drive off the undead hordes you earned the favor of one of the seven Merchant Princes of Port Nyanzaru! This fellow's name is Wakanga O'tamu, a dealer in magic and lore. He's the one who provided a compound for our expedition.  I've been studying the local customs since I arrived. Since he extended his favor to us, it would be best to present yourself to him as soon as possible. He may prove to be a useful ally for us!
Run Through the Jungle^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Niles Breakbone^Soshenstar River^Prince of Chult^Dead Reckoning^Meet Niles Breakbone at Camp Vengeance by the Soshenstar River in Chult.^From what your friends Volo and Minsc have told me, you seek to end the death curse that plagues our world. I do not have the answers you seek, but others have come before you and may have more information. I suggest you start with Niles Breakbone. He's the commander of Camp Vengeance by the Soshenstar River south of Port Nyanzaru. His templars have had many first-hand encounters with the undead which infest our land, and may know more.
Dead Reckoning^70^Niles Breakbone^Soshenstar River^Niles Breakbone^Soshenstar River^Run Through the Jungle^Fallen Templars^Talk to Perne Salhana at Camp Vengeance. Destroy undead and consecrate necromantic remains near the Soshenstar River in Chult.^The undead are everywhere in this blasted jungle! That's why the Order of the Gauntlet came here in the first place: to purge this evil from the land! But we lost many of our people in the attempt. Even now the undead gather around the edges of Camp Vengeance to finish their foul work! Perne Salhana has found locations of desecrated remains around the jungle and has a plan to destroy them. Talk to her about the details.
Fallen Templars^70^Sister Cyas^Soshenstar River^Sister Cyas^Soshenstar River^Dead Reckoning^The Old Crone^Recover camp supplies and heal wounded templars around Camp Righteous by the Soshenstar River in Chult.^When the undead overwhelmed Camp Righteous, we lost many good soldiers, and barely escaped with our lives. Now we're running low on supplies, and getting desperate. We sent some of our remaining templars to Camp Righteous to recover some camp supplies, but they haven't returned. I fear they have succumbed to sickness, injury, or worse. We could use your help. Head to Camp Righteous east of Camp Vengeance and recover some camp supplies.  If you find any of our missing templars there, please render them whatever aid you can.
The Old Crone^70^Niles Breakbone^Soshenstar River^Nanny Pu'pu^Soshenstar River^Fallen Templars^Hunting Batiri^Use the Crone's Charm to access the hidden path leading to Mbala near the Soshenstar River in Chult.^You have done much to aid our cause, adventurer. I will keep true to my word by revealing what I know about the death curse. There is an old crone who lives on the hidden plateau of Mbala overlooking the Soshenstar River area. She goes by the name of Nanny Pu'pu. The locals speak of her having powerful magic and she speaks with spirits of the dead. She may be the one who created your charm, for I possess a similiar one called the Crone's Charm. This will reveal the way to Mbala.
Hunting Batiri^70^Nanny Pu'pu^Soshenstar River^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^The Old Crone^^Hunt Batiri goblins and recover stolen juju bags at Yellyark near the Soshenstar River in Chult. Search for the lost expedition member while you're there.^You've returned Nanny's magic! Very good!  Ah, but your friend is dead! So sad! Perhaps Nanny Pu'pu can help you with that...
Welcome to the Jungle^70^Ze' Vana Ritzulma^Port Nyanzaru^^Port Nyanzaru^Hunting Batiri^^Accept the free T'ej from the Equipment Dealer^You, adventurer. I hear you are a ward of Wakanga while you are here in Nyanzaru. You plan to leave the city, yes? If the prince has taken interest in you, you would do well not to die on your first expedition. You will need durable equipment and sturdy companions to survive the jungle. I can help you with equipment, and perhaps this t'ej may help you find companions. It is yours.
A Little Research^70^Volothamp Geddarm^Port Nyanzaru^Volothamp Geddarm^Port Nyanzaru^Hunting Batiri^^Help Volo Classify the Creatures of Chult.^How fared your audience with the Prince? Eager to get started on the road to fame and fortune? I told you about the "King of Spines" before, the boat-sized beastie. The hunters around here know how to lure such rare marks out of hiding, and they'll trade that information for trophies from rare fiends. Go out, find just such a monster and bring back a trophy. With your help this book will be my magnum opus. That means bestseller.
Out-Pirate the Pirates^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Recapture the merchant ship and recover Treasure Chests from the pirates.^Pirates and corsairs - or worse - have been targeting our Chultan trade ships, boarding and taking all. The last ship we sent out had small chests that contained... certain objects valuable to those in the magic trade. I have been signaled via messenger bird that the ship has been boarded, but not yet burned or sailed off. <name>, we have a chance to strike fast and strike hard. I implore you: take one of my fast boats in the harbor and catch the merchant ship. Retake her if you can, and by all means, find and recover those chests and bring them back to me! Succeed, and the merchant princes will lavish you in gifts.
Patrolling Chult^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Complete Wakanga O'tamu's Patrol Quests around Chult.^There are many dangerous places around Chult, from coasts plagued by pirates of the Jahaka Anchorage, to jungles overrun with beasts, to temple ruins claimed by monsters. Help me reclaim the lands and the treasures they hold. 
Hunt and Gather^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Find and Rescue Adventuring Party from the Jungles of Chult.^My friend, I have a delicate situation. I have granted permission to a party of adventurers to explore ruins on an old trading route near the Mist Cliffs. The adventurers were to find some particular items which might help solve the death curse. They were to return a fortnight ago, but alas they have not been seen. I would ask of you, an avid adventurer, to see if you could locate them, and make sure they did not make off with the items themselves. Enter the jungle and search for the brave  adventurers. If they are beyond salvation, retrieve their belongings for me and clear the trade route.
Hidden Treasures^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Search the Temple Ruins for Idols.^My friend! I have come into some information regarding a Chultan temple that may have in its depths small idols of Ubtao. Such items would be of great value to certain clients of mine. Sadly, I cannot seek them myself. Beware that the temple ruins are not abandoned. I shall make an offer to you. Retrieve these idols for me, and in trade I shall reward you generously!
Missing Scouts^70^Wulf Rygor^Soshenstar River^Wulf Rygor^Soshenstar River^^^Rescue Chultan scouts from Yellyark near the Soshenstar River in Chult^The Batiri have been a nuisance ever since we arrived here. They are too cowardly to attack unless they have large numbers, but fiercely protect their lands at Yellyark. Some of our scouts have gone missing around Yellyark. If you can help rescue them from the Batiri it would mean much to us.
Chultan Treasures^70^Lorsa Bilwatal^Soshenstar River^Lorsa Bilwatal^Soshenstar River^^^Recover lost relics from ruins found around the Soshenstar River in Chult.^We help the Order of the Gauntlet purge the undead from our lands, but we have other reasons for being here. There are many lost relics of the Chultan people which mean little to outsiders but are invaluable to us. Unfortunately, most of these relics are in lost ruins around the Soshenstar River area, and these have been overrrun by jungle beasts, undead, or worse. If you can bring back these relics, you'd be doing a great service for us.
Pillaging the Pirates^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Recover Chultan Maps from the pirate cove in Chult.^Pirates and corsairs are continually boarding and pillaging our merchant ships, taking everything before sinking the ships. The last ship they hit had a particular set of Chultan maps meant for my personal library. One of the fishermen saw where the brigands made landing, on a cove about a half day's sail from here. I beseech you, <name>. Take one of my boats, sail to the cove, recover my maps, and eradicate all vermin from that beach!
Recovering Trade Goods^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Recover Chultan Maps from the lost adventure party.^I've granted other adventurers and merchants my maps and charts so they may find trade routes through the jungle. Alas, it has been weeks since they were heard from, and I fear they did not, shall we say, make a profit for either themselves or me. Should those maps fall into the wrong hands it could create a great amount of trouble for myself and the other merchant princes. I would strike a deal with you, <name>. Go into the jungle and follow this map. Find and rescue the other adventurers if possible, but by all means, recover my maps and clear the trade route of any creatures that you encounter.
Shrines of Ubtao^70^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^^^Speak to Wakanga O'tamu, then sanctify the Shrines of Ubtao found around the Soshenstar River area in Chult.^I have something important to tell you. When I was "dead", I received a vision from Selûne which may help us solve the riddle of the death curse. Once this land was protected by the god Ubtao. Ras Nsi was a Chosen paladin of Ubtao, but was cast down when he betrayed his oaths. Ras Nsi has since pledged himself to a great evil dwelling in the Lost City of Omu -- an evil connected to the death curse. I believe our path lies in finding this Ras Nsi. While Ubtao is gone, shrines containing remnants of his divine power still exist in Chult. If we can gain the blessing of Ubtao, he may open the way to the Lost City of Omu and Ras Nsi. I suggest talking to the Merchant Prince Wakanga O'tamu.
Shrines of Ubtao^70^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^^^Sanctify the Shrines of Ubtao found around the Soshenstar River area in Chult.^The Shrines of Ubtao have once again been despoiled by the evil that permeates this land. We must keep these shrines sanctified if we are to drive our enemy back.
Ancient Magic^70^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^Wakanga O'tamu^Port Nyanzaru^^^Search the Temple Ruins for Magical Glyphs.^Welcome most venerable <name>!  It is no doubt the favor of the nine gods that we have met up today, for I am in great need of your services. I have been given information that deep within an ancient temple are carved glyphs that may reveal much about the magic of Ubtao. Several adventurers I have parlayed to retrieve them for me, but alas none have returned. But you, I feel are the lucky <class> that can make this happen. Help me in securing these glyphs and I shall reward you and give to you a treasure map where you can find more riches!
The Hunters of Chult^70^Volothamp Geddarm^Port Nyanzaru^Volothamp Geddarm^Port Nyanzaru^^^Join the Hunters of Chult in tracking down and defeating the mightiest Creatures of Chult.^Congratulations <name>. These fine fellows of the hunters' guild tell me you can help them by hunting in the jungles near the Soshenstar River. Certain rare creatures throughout Chult can be hunted for trophies. Find a trophy that one of the hunters' guild is after and they will trade with you for items you need to track down larger prey.
House of the Crocodile^70^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^^^Sanctify the Greater Shrine of Ubtao found in the House of the Crocodile by the Soshenstar River in Chult.^The vision from Selûne is clear now. There is a greater shrine of Ubtao in a long-forgotten temple known as the House of the Crocodile near the Soshenstar River. But the shrine has been despoiled by evil creatures, and must be sanctified. Beware my friend, the creatures who dwell there serve the same dark power as Ras Nsi. But it is there where we may find the answers we seek.
House of the Crocodile^70^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^Celeste^Port Nyanzaru^^^Sanctify the Greater Shrine of Ubtao found in the House of the Crocodile by the Soshenstar River in Chult.^The greater shrine of Ubtao in the House of the Crocodile has once again been despoiled by evil creatures, and must be sanctified. Drive them from this place, and make it whole again.
Before the Mast^70^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^^^Harvest 5 pieces of Mast Timber^Many of the boats in the fishing fleet were damaged when the ice trolls attacked. Now I know nothing about boats, but apparently we lack suitable timber for making masts. I'm told the hardened trees we harvest for this are located deep in thr forest in an area now overrun with giants and trolls. The town's lumberjacks marked suitable trees weeks ago, but it's too dangerous for them to venture out there now. Think you can help? Drive back the giants and trolls, and if you spot any trees marked with a red banner, chop them down and bring back the lumber.
Fire is Life^70^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^^^Clear the logging area, collect firewood, and stoke the braziers.^This unnatural cold is sapping everyone's strength. I've had the braziers lighted among the waterfront so people can stop and warm themselves, but I fear it may not be enough. To make matters worse, those damned frost goblins keep interfering with our logging operations and we're running desperately short of firewood. I need you to go to the logging area and bring back as much as you can?
Tending the Shrine^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Shrine of Mielikki^^Protect Mielikki's Shrine^Hunters have spotted more trolls near my garden. We should investigate and make sure they are not trying to desecrate Mielikki's shrine again.
Hidebound^70^Nord Gantara^Lonelywood^Nord Gantara^Lonelywood^^^Hunt animals for hides.^Some of these tents have seen better days and the nights around here are pretty cold. Could you bring us some hides to patch the tents up?
Natural Medicine^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^^^Collect 6 Medicinal Herbs^The combination of too many people in too few shelters and this unnatural cold is causing sickness amongst the weakest refugees. We must prevent this from spreading, now. I am going to brew some herbal remedies, but my stocks of medicinal herbs are low. Would you gather some from the forest while I begin brewing?
Gauntlgrym Stores^70^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^Bruenor Battlehammer^Mantol-Derith^^^Speak to the Gauntlgrym Supplier in Mantol-Derith.^Looks like ye got yerself some supplies. I got one of me, smiths from Gauntlgrym here, willin' to trade armors and weapons we've made for any spare supplies ye got. Why don't ye go talk to me supplier and see what's available?
Recovering Relics^70^Tristopher Chettlebell^Bryn Shander^Tristopher Chettlebell^Bryn Shander^^^Collect an Ostorian Relic in the Bryn Shander Outskirts^The maps I was provided show there were Ostorian settlements throughout this region. One of my assistants spied what looks to be a support column of Ostorian origin just outside the city walls. Take this trowel and use it to recover any artifacts in the area around the column. Be gentle! Many of these artifacts are quite fragile. Once the artifact is in your possession, return here and I will assess its value. Should you need another trowel, just get another from this crate beside me.
Defending Lonelywood^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Catti-brie^Filling Bellies^Shrine of Mielikki^Attack the ice troll camp. Kill trolls, burn supplies and defeat Heimstal, the troll's general.^Now the townspeople are safe, there is one last task that must be attended to before we retrieve the thistle from my garden. Hunters report that the trolls you drove out of town regrouped at a camp deep in the forest. A giant named Heimstal stopped their retreat and is whipping them back into a fighting force to retake Lonelywood. We need to destroy that camp, and remove the trolls' leadership.
Shrine of Mielikki^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^Tending the Shrine^Protect Mielikki's shrine and harvest the Thistle for Makos.^While you were fighting in the troll camp, I saw a group slip out and head west. It looks like they are headed straight for my garden! We need to get there immediately and stop them from defiling my shrine to Mielikki.
Defending the Dale^70^Duvessa Shane^Bryn Shander^^Bryn Shander^^^Complete quests given by Xuna, Cecil, and Markham Southwell in Bryn Shander.^People may think Bryn Shander is destroyed, but I say we still have a fighting chance. Some still remain who believe we know how to keep the city afloat. Your friend, Xuna, is one of them. Even Cecil, for all his cowardice, has proven to be a fairly good tactician. Perhaps his true strengths were not being put to use. Markham has received reports on a number of pressing issues from the guards. Help my people, and I promise you will be repaid.
Shattered Guard Badge^70^^Bryn Shander^Huntsman Jorl^Bryn Shander^^^Return Shattered Guard Badge to Huntsman Jorl outside of Bryn Shander.^You recovered the remnants of a guard badge from a barbarian. Perhaps he stole the badge from a guard he killed. Etched onto the badge is the name "Harshten". You've heard a huntsman named Jorl would pay a fine price for items such as this.
Ritual Bones^70^^Bryn Shander^Huntsman Jorl^Bryn Shander^^^Return Ritual Bones to Huntsman Jorl outside of Bryn Shander.^You recovered the components of some sort of harebrained scheme by a goblin. It appears it was trying to thaw out one of the frozen dragons outside of Bryn Shander. You've heard a Huntsman named Jorl would pay a fine price for this.
Secrets of the Cocoon^70^Duvessa Shane^Bryn Shander^^Bryn Shander^^^Meet with Makos at the Storm Epicenter.^You've helped me survive for this long, <name>. You have my thanks. We've received word that a tiefling has arrived at the epicenter and is studying the cocoon. He didn't say a word to anyone, he simply walked in and made his way to the cocoon. Can you go speak to this tiefling and see what business he has in my town?
Cracked Tiara^70^^Bryn Shander^Huntsman Jorl^Bryn Shander^^^Return the Cracked Tiara to Huntsman Jorl outside of Bryn Shander.^You recovered a tattered token of affection after defeating a ghost within Bryn Shander. You've heard a Huntsman named Jorl would pay a fine price for items such as this.
Blizzard's Return^70^Duvessa Shane^Bryn Shander^Duvessa Shane^Bryn Shander^^^Take Shelter and Defeat Invading Beasts^These freakish blizzards continue to assault the city. A large one is about to descend on us, and that always means beasts manage to make their way into the city. Seek shelter with the rest of the town, wait for the worst of the storm to be over... then slay any beasts in the streets and protect Bryn Shander's dwindling food supplies.
Fool's Gold^60^Sandesyl Morgia^Well of Dragons^Sandesyl Morgia^Well of Dragons^Factional Assets^^Replace Cult Treasure Chests with Mimics.^Now here's a task I think you'll really enjoy. If not, I'm sure I could find some other sorry sap to take your place. In case you haven't been paying attention, the Cult of the Dragon is amassing a hoard of treasure as tribute to Tiamat. I know you're trying to steal it back, but that's such a short-term solution. We need to think about doing more lasting harm. Go to the cult base camp and replace their treasure chests with these mimics we've trained. If all goes well, the cultists usurpers won't know what hit them, and will seriously question the rest of their treasure hoard. Last thing they'll want to do is present the Queen of Dragons with bogus treasures.
Rituals of the Realms^^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^The Missing Link^^Visit ritual sites and collect Reclaimed Magic from enemies in the River District.^Each of the wizards with a presence in the River District has set up a ritual site deep inside their territory. I suspect they are using them to channel energy back to their demi-planes for use in a larger ritual to open a portal to the Far Realm. The completion of that ritual would be... bad. Observe each of these sites directly and report back to me. Please take succinct notes, this crisis has made my time even more precious than usual. Gather some magic items while you are out there. If my suspicions are correct, you can use the magic to purge energy out of the ritual site and set back the progress of the ritual.
Riverfront Rumble^^Dockhand^River District^^^^^Rescue Laborers in the Riverfront neighborhood.^Thanks for gettin' those goons offa me. Couldya help out my friends, too? We've heard there was work here for anyone with a strong back, so we traveled up the river on the first boat that would take us. When we got here, those blasted Nashers told us to turn back, there's no work here. When we didn't immediately high tail it, they attacked us! My buddies ran off with Nashers chasing them. Would you help them out if you see them?
Reclaiming River Districts^^Sergeant Hawthidon^River District^Sergeant Hawthidon^River District^The Missing Link^^Recover a Nasher weapons cache from the sewers.^Hello, <name>! Good to be working with someone who knows what they're doing! We've been trying to establish a series of strongpoints throughout the district, but they are under constant attack. Neverember is being stingy with his supplies, so much of the weaponry we recover goes right back into keeping troops in the field. I've got a tip about a stash of Nasher weapons in the sewer, but I don't have any troops to spare. Could you recover the weapons for me? The situation is very fluid, so you may need to recover a guard post and dig site from the enemy. Take these Reclaimed Weapons with you. Use some to get yourself a map of the local sewers. The rest can be used to reactivate an abandoned guard post or reinforce an active one.
Nostura of the Stone Eye^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^Archdruid Morningdawn^River District^Defeating Nostura^Twisted Fey^Collect corrupted fey essence in the Tainted Grove.^To penetrate Nostura's portal we need to determine the source of her power. It pains me to say this, but I'm hardly an expert on fey magic, entirely too chaotic for my tastes. However, if you recover the essence of the creatures who serve Nostura, I believe Archdruid Morningdawn can point us in the right direction.
A Northern Journey^70^Duvessa Shane^Bryn Shander^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^^^Travel to Lonelywood^Catti-brie has created a garden in Lonelywood dedicated to the goddess Mielikki. In that garden grows a special plant. In order to open this ice cocoon without harming Artus or his son, Makos needs a special thistle from this plant as a ritual component. Travel to Lonelywood with Wulfgar, locate Catti-brie, and get this thistle.
Rebuilding Lonelywood^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^A Northern Journey^Filling Bellies^Kill frost goblins and hunt for hides.^I want to help you and Makos to solve the problem in Bryn Shander, but people are suffering in Lonelywood right now. Townspeople have lost their homes and more refugees from the south are arriving hourly. This is a harsh climate. Survival is not guaranteed even under the best conditions. If we don't take steps to feed and house these people immediately, they are going to die. We urgently need to build shelters to get these people out of the cold, but frost goblins have been harassing our lumberjacks and there is no wood. Stop the goblin raiders so we can rebuild our supplies of lumber and firewood. We also need hides to make clothing and tents. If you encounter any of the hostile frost wolves or polar bears that befoul these forests, bring back their hides.
Filling Bellies^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Rebuilding Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^Catch fish to feed the refugees in Lonelywood.^People have a place to stay warm thanks to your efforts, now we need to get some food in them. The trolls stole or destroyed much of the food in town. The undamaged fishing boats have put out onto Maer Dualdon, but this unnatural cold is making it hard to work the nets. There is good fishing along the shores to the north and south of town, but it is too dangerous for an inexperienced person to fish there. You shouldn't have any problems, though. Please, take this fishing pole and bring back some much-needed food.
Defeating Gyrion^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^River District^^^Discover the information needed to defeat Gyrion.^The members of the Cloaked Ascendancy are too powerful to take on as a group. We will need to divide and conquer if we wish to defeat them. To do that we need to learn more about them. What were their past connections to Neverwinter? Do they have any weaknesses? How do their minions operate? Gyrion is one of the more mysterious members of the Ascendancy. He appears little affected by his time in the Far Realm, but I suspect the scars run deep in that one.
Kabal the Firesoul^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^River District^Defeating Kabal^An Old Flame^Collect armor fragments. Activate scrying devices.^To get you through the wards around Kabal's portal I need to know more about how he works his magic. A good place to start is with the constructs patrolling Ember Hollow. Destroy a few and bring back samples of their armor. I also need to know how autonomous these constructs are. Here are some orbs. They contain an improved version of the scrying spells we employed in the Sea of Moving Ice. Place them at the locations I have marked with runed rocks.
An Old Flame^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^River District^Kabal the Firesoul^^Visit the Sage Shop in Protector's Enclave and search for information on Kabal.^Now that I understand how Kabal's mind works, I need something personal to him. With that I can complete the spell to allow you to pass through his portal. If my research is correct, which of course it is, our Kabal was once known as Kabal the Frail. He was quite weak and sickly and rarely left the Cloak Tower. One of the few times he left the tower was for a weekly trip to a shop to purchase a medicinal concoction for his many ailments. That shop still exists in Protector's Enclave. You should visit it and see if anyone there can provide useful information.
Defeating Kabal^70^Kavatos Stormeye^River District^^River District^^^Discover the information needed to defeat Kabal.^The members of the Cloaked Ascendancy are too powerful to take on as a group. We will need to divide and conquer if we wish to defeat them. To do that we need to learn more about them. What were their past connections to Neverwinter? Do they have any weaknesses? How do their minions operate? Kabal the Firesoul is an interesting case. If my preliminary investigations are correct, he was once known as Kabal the Frail. The Far Realm has obviously changed him.
Making the Rounds^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^^Deliver Herbal Medicine to Sick Refugees^I have some herbal medicine made from the plants in my garden and others found in the Lonelywood. Could you deliver them to any sick refugees you find in town while I start on a fresh batch?
Festival of Bryn Shander^70^Sergeant Knox^Bryn Shander^Alden Lowell^Bryn Shander^^Merchant Woes^Speak with Lord Neverember about traveling to Bryn Shander.^Greetings, <name>! Up for something a bit more festive? Your help is requested regarding a festival in Bryn Shander. Speak with Lord Neverember for more details, he asked for you by name.
Merchant Woes^70^Alden Lowell^Bryn Shander^Guard Cecil^Bryn Shander^Festival of Bryn Shander^^Recover merchant wares in the outskirts of Bryn Shander.^I..., er, we need a plan. Since you helped those merchants, there's enough of us that we could make it back to Caer Konig. The merchants lost much in the attack, but I know some of their wares are still strewn across the tundra. Can you recover them and bring them back? The sooner the better... I want to get out of here! ... and make sure Caer Konig is safe, of course.
Donating to the Defense^4-70^Siege Defense Coordinator^Protector's Enclave^Defense Supply Master^Protector's Enclave^A Pledge of Support^Professional Defense, Supplying the Defense^Meet with the Defense Supply Master to learn how to donate to Neverwinter's defense.^The city is under siege, and we are running low on vital supplies. Lord Neverember has asked all who can to donate to Neverwinter's defense. If you'd like to help, then you should meet with the Defense Supply Master here in Protector's Enclave.
Harbor Master^70^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^^Search the cargo on the docks for Stolen Food.^I'm sure you're aware of Lonelywood's reputation as a haven for those with checkered pasts. Truth be told, I may have bent or broken a few laws in my youth, but I draw the line at profiting at the expense of another's survival. I've heard that some of the food stores have gone missing and refugees are being charged exorbitant prices for a meal. I'm all for making a little extra coin, but lives are at stake here. As crowded as the town has become, the stolen food is probably being hidden in plain sight. Check the cargo on the docks and be prepared for trouble.
Eviction Notice^70^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^^Kill ice trolls and burn supplies in the troll camp.^Trolls are nothing if not stubborn. Despite the havoc you caused on your last visit to their camp, they have not packed up and left. I think it's time for you to pay them another "friendly" visit and encourage them to move along.
Training Day^70^Nord Gantara^Lonelywood^Nord Gantara^Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^^Take one of the Lonelywood refugees on a training patrol.^The refugees here want to help defend this place, but many of them have spent their lives inside the walls of their town. They really need someone with practical experience in combat to show them the ropes. Would you be willing to take one of them on a short patrol?
Stay Frosty^70^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Avandro Perth^Lonelywood^Defending Lonelywood^^Kill 25 Frost Goblins.^Frost goblin raiders continue to harass the townspeople. It's time they learned once and for all they need to move on to easier targets. I think you're the person to teach them.
The Harper Emissary^4-70^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^To the Farthest Forest^^Consult with the Harper Emissary Talith Adrinel in New Sharandar^The Harpers are seeking allies in many quarters. They have even sent an emissary to the Feywild to treat with the proud Illyanbruen elves. If anyone can form a lasting alliance with those reclusive fey, it is Talith Adrinel. I would like you to seek out Talith in New Sharandar and learn what progress he has made with the Illyanbruen.
Unwelcome Guests^70^Lord Neverember^Protector's Enclave^^Barovia^^Welcome to Barovia^Travel to Wyndrake Manor and help the Duchess^Ah, here you are at last. I have an important task for you, NAME. A wealthy patron of the city is experiencing some difficulty on her lands. She has requested my assistance and it is in the city's best interests to help her. The lady in question is the Duchess of Wyndrake, and I would deem it a personal favor if you would make haste to her manor and render your assistance. Unfortunately, I can't spare any guards, and the situation is quite urgent, apparently. Wyndrake Manor is an impressive stronghold to the east of Neverwinter. Please hurry. She is, as I mentioned, a wealthy patron.
Welcome to Barovia^70^^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Unwelcome Guests^Dead Letter^Meet with Ezmerelda d'Avenir in the Village of Barovia^The Vistani told you to seek out Ezmerelda d'Avenir in the Village of Barovia.
Dead Letter^70^^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Welcome to Barovia^Grave Endeavors, Dark Heroics^Meet Ireena Kolyana at the Burgomaster's Mansion in the Village of Barvoia^So you have a letter from the burgomaster of Barovia requesting aid? Well, I'm not sure if the letter is very old or a forgery, but I have some bad news to tell you. The burgomaster has passed on under mysterious circumstances. Only his daughter Ireena remains. I suggest you speak with her. She's nearby, across the main village road at the burgomaster's mansion. She can verify if this is her father's handwriting. If it is, you can ask her about the 'evil affliction' of which her father spoke of in his letter.
Grave Endeavors^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Dead Letter^Company of Hunters^Investigate the disturbed graves in the Barovian Graveyard.^These fearful Barovians have been crushed under the heel of Strahd for too long. There are monsters lurking everywhere, ready to strike the unwary. Even the sanctity of the grave is no more. Strange figures have been seen moving about the graveyard disturbing the resting place of those buried there. We cannot let this pass. Head to the graveyard and stop whoever is responsible for this desecration!
Company of Hunters^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Grave Endeavors^Corruption of Nature, Light in the Darkness, Dream Pastries, Ghosts of Berez^Meet Szolodar Szoldarovich, Danika Dorakova, and Vikov Ulrich at the Blood on the Vine Tavern in the Village of Barovia.^Now you are properly equipped. There are others who share my desire to rid Barovia of its monsters. They have witnessed first-hand the evils that stalk this land, and could use your help. Head inside the Blood on the Vine Tavern, and speak with Szoldar Szoldarovich, Danika Dorakova, and Vikov Ulrich. Learn their stories and see what you can do to help them.
Corruption of Nature^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Company of Hunters^The Direfang Hunt, Barovian Vigil^Investigate standing stones around the Whispering Wood.^Within the groves of the Whispering Wood there is a great corruption spreading. Men driven mad by Strahd have come to worship him at dark altars in the woods. Their magic corrupts the very land, and it's said the trees themselves have come alive with evil intent. Of course, you should witness this yourself. Investigate the standing stones scattered around the Whispering Wood to discover the truth.
The Direfang Hunt^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Corruption of Nature^^Your first Monster Hunt.^You have proven yourself brave and daring. Perhaps you are ready to attempt something even more dangerous. There are deadly creatures in the lands around Barovia. These have plagued us for so long that legends have sprung up around them and people offer bounties for their destruction. Direfang is a vicious, undead direwolf with a dark reputation. If you find him before he finds you, and if you survive to slay him, you would join the ranks of the Monster Hunters of Barovia. I have hung the Wanted Poster for Direfang nearby. Will you take on this challenge?
Rare Vintage^70^Champagne du le Stomp^Barovia^Arik Lorensk^Barovia^^^Give Champagne du le Stomp to Arik Lorensk at the Blood on the Vine Tavern in the Village of Barovia.^This wine is labeled Champagne du le Stomp, the rarest and most sought after vintage in all Barovia. Bring the wine to the Blood on the Vine Tavern so you can be rewarded for liberating it from the clutches of evil.
Light in the Darkness^70^Szoldar Szoldarovich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Szoldar Szoldarovich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Company of Hunters^^Get camp supplies from Bildrath's Mercantile. Use them to resupply the travelers camp in the Howling Hills.^The wilds of Barovia are a dangerous place, and it gets worse every day. I spent most of my life in there, and these days I am finding the safety of taverns more comfortable. But we cannot let these lands fall to beasts and monsters! Hunters have set up travelers camps all around the valley. At these camps you can rest and find safety from a creature who hunts when darkness falls, a creature known as the Night Terror. Camp supplies must be replenished from time to time. I have purchased such things from Bildrath's Mercantile. If you could resupply the camp in the Howling Hills, you would have my thanks.
Dream Pastries^70^Danika Dorakova^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Danika Dorakova^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Company of Hunters^^Gather a dream pastry from a dream-bound Barovian in the village, and ghostly toadstools and spider venom in the Cursed Meadow.^There is an old woman who sometimes comes to the village at night, selling what she calls 'dream pastries'. They induce a euphoria-like state in anyone who eats them, to the point that people are willing to spend all their coins just to escape their day-to-day lives. I do not trust the old woman or the wares she peddles. There's something sinister going on, and I intend to find out. I would like to make a potion to help discern the properties of the dream pastry. I have most of the ingredients, but am lacking a few vital components: a dream pastry, ghostly toadstools, and spider venom. The toadstools can be found around the farms of the Cursed Meadow, but can only be seen at night. The spiders lurk in the winding paths of the western Cursed Meadow. Would you help me gather what I need?
Ghosts of Berez^70^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Company of Hunters^Mortal Remains^Talk with the ghosts in the Ruins of Berez.^Once, the village of Berez was not unlike the village of Barovia. But everything changed when Strahd found a young woman who lived there, named Marina. Some say she bore a striking resemblence to Strahd von Zarovich's lost love. Strahd became obsessed with her. But some of the villagers noticed what was happening to Marina, and she died before Strahd could make her his bride! Strahd was enraged, slew many of the villagers, and used his powers over the land to reduce the village to ruins. Now the village is overwhelmed by undead. Some of the ghosts of the villagers still haunt the ruins, bound by the Dark Powers for their role in Marina's death. Speak with the ghosts to learn the truth of their deeds.
Mortal Remains^70^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Ghosts of Berez^Dishonorable Dead^Find unearthed remains and slay ghouls in the Ruins of Berez, then bury and seal them in the mausoleum in the Barovian Graveyard.^Those who died in Strahd's destruction of Berez do not rest easy. You've already met some of the ghosts who haunt Berez. Now ghouls dig in the ruins, desecrating the graves of those buried when the village fell. We should not leave the dead to such a fate. If you can find any remains in the ruins of Berez, bring them to the graveyard and inter them in the high mausoleum. Then use this holy ritual to ensure they remain sealed within. Destroy any of those damnable ghouls you find along the way!
Dishonorable Dead^70^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Mortal Remains^^Locate and slay the vampiric honor guards and undead who lurk around the Ruins of Berez^It was not enough for Strahd to kill those responsible for Marina's death and destroy their village. He cursed the place, causing the dead to rise. He occasionally sends his own vampiric honor guard to patrol the ruins to taunt the ghosts of the dead villagers while pillaging its treasures. A strike against Strahd's honor guard is a strike against Strahd himself. Head to the Ruins of Berez and slay and honor guard you find there. Put to rest any undead you find there as well.
Cauldron Bubble^70^Danika Dorakova^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Danika Dorakova^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Dream Pastries^^Take consecrated water from the fountain in the Barovian Graveyard and add it to the witch cauldrons around the Cursed Meadow.^The witches who creep in the Cursed Meadow work foul magic in their cauldrons, summoning evil spirits and casting curses on unsuspecting Barovians. These magical maladies must be stopped! Head to the Barovian graveyard and gather consecrated water from the fountain there. It still has vestiges of the Morninglord's power, and can be used to disrupt the evil in the witch's cauldrons. Be careful! Sometimes disrupting magic in this manner draws the attention of powerful spirits!
Straw Man^70^Danika Dorakova^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Danika Dorakova^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Cauldron Bubble^^Recover demonic essences bound into scarecrows around the Cursed Meadow. Destroy the essences in the fountain in the Barovian Graveyard.^Barovian witches are capable of binding evil spirits into mundane items and animating them to do their will. The worst are the creatures we know as scarecrows, seemingly inanimate field guardians who suddenly attack! While the scarecrows can be destroyed, the demonic essences bound into them either return to their former existence or run free to befoul the land. But if you can gather these essences, you can bring them to the consecrated water in the graveyard to destroy them forever!
Rituals of Corruption^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^The Direfang Hunt^^Recover ritual components and knock over the profane cairns in the Whispering Wood. Destroy the ritual components in the brazier at the Vistani Camp.^The druids of the Whispering Wood conduct their dark rituals to corrupt the lands, while the wild men construct profane cairns to honor Strahd. This must be stopped. To conduct their ritual, the druids gather all manner of foul components. If these can be found and destroyed, it will hamper their ability to conduct their rituals. Likewise, the cairns can be tumbled to diminish the power of the berserkers. Do this and perhaps we can help push back the corruption of this land.
Draconic Alchemy^70^Sandesyl Morgia^Well of Dragons^Sandesyl Morgia^Well of Dragons^^^Enter the Drake Pens in the Well of Dragons, disrupt the Alchemical Rituals and defeat the Master Alchemist.^The Cult of the Dragon has a secret. Those monstrous drakes you see with them? They are not hatched, but born of foul alchemy from the remnants of dragons! These drakes bolster the forces of the Cult of the Dragon considerably. Enter the Drake Pens in the Well of Dragons, disrupt their alchemical rituals, and slay the Master Alchemist!
Punishing the Oppressors^70^Linu La'neral^Well of Dragons^Linu La'neral^Well of Dragons^^^Defeat Cultist Torturers in the Prison Camp^It's bad enough the Cult of the Dragon kidnapped our people to be used as sacrifices to their evil goddess, but we're getting reports from some of the rescued survivors of the unspeakable travesties inflicted upon them. I can't bear to stand by and let these transgressions go unpunished. Could you be a dear and teach them a lesson they won't soon forget?
Lighting the Fires^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Light in the Darkness^^Get camp supplies from Bildrath's Mercantile. Use them to resupply the travelers camp in the Howling Hills, Ruins of Berez, Whispering Wood, and the Cursed Meadow.^I understand you've already aided Szoldar with resupplying the travelers' camp in the Howling Hills. Other hunters have already spoken in appreciation of your deed, having narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Night Terror. Let's make sure all the travelers' camps are resupplied. I've arranged for Bildrath to ready more camp supplies. Pick them up and resupply the camps in the Howling Hills, the Ruins of Berez, the Whispering Wood, and the Cursed Meadow.
Dire Consequences^70^Szoldar Szoldarovich^Barovia^Szoldar Szoldarovich^Barovia^Light in the Darkness^Tracking the Beast^Collect meat from the deer along the Ivlis River. Use it to lure out and kill the dire wolf alphas in the Howling Hills.^The wolves of Barovia have always been fierce. The greatest among them are the dire wolves, merciless predators who seem to kill as much for pleasure as they do for food. They devour game, attack travelers on the road, and are heard howling outside our windows at night. They must be driven back. The dire wolf packs are led by powerful alphas, but lair in dark dens in the Howling Hills. To draw them out you must give them what they crave: fresh meat. Hunt the deer along the Ivlis River, then take the meat to active wolf dens in the hills.
Pack of Lies^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^The Direfang Hunt^Lost in the Ruins^Join Szoldar Szoldarovich in searching the Howling Hills for the missing villagers and keep looking for the Sunsword.^You seek a weapon with a shining blade, yes? My tarokka cards tell me the treasure is in the mouth of a cave. It seems to me that there are a lot of caves in the Howling Hills, so maybe that would be a good place to start. What's more, some locals have gone missing in that area and Szoldar is planning to mount a search for them. He could use some assistance... but is too proud to admit it. Talk to him inside the tavern, if you want to help him. Perhaps it will lead you to the sword.
Unlikely Allies^70^Shay Cutter^Well of Dragons^Shay Cutter^Well of Dragons^^^Collect Scout Reports from Zhentarim Scouts.^I still don't know if I like collaborating with the people who have worked against us for so long, but if we're going to live through this, I get why we have to. The Zhentarim are renowned in our ability to stealthfully gather information, so it's no wonder we've been instrumental in this operation. Without our help, we'd all be doomed. Right now, we have several scouts in the field tracking enemy activity, but we're low on backup troops. Normally, we'd have runners bringing back reports from our scouts, but since you're already fighting out there, it only makes sense to get you to retrieve those reports and bring them back to me.
The Old Mill^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Tome of Strahd campaign task?^Castle Ravenloft, The Old Bonegrinder^Speak with Danika Dorakova and try to learn the location of the Tome of Strahd.^The last treasure we need is the Tome of Strahd. If Strahd doesn't have it, it must be in the hands of someone who dares defy him. I have asked the Keepers of the Feathers to use all their spies to find out where the tome could be. It's possible they have come up with something. When I last saw Danika, she seemed even more agitated than usual... something about pies... I didn't really understand. You'll find her waiting in the tavern. Perhaps she might help you locate the tome.
The Old Bonegrinder^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^The Old Mill^^Speak with Danika Dorakova and help her resolve the problem with Old Bonegrinder.^Danika has been looking for you. She tells me something is amiss at the Old Bonegrinder Mill. It seems that a new batch of dream pastries arrived in the village. You'll find her waiting for you in the tavern. Try to calm her down.
Crustacean Cuisine^70^examining Crab Meat that sometimes drops from crabs in Lonelywood^Lonelywood^Nord Gantara^Lonelywood^^^Collect 20 pieces of Crab Meat.^The crabs in Maer Dualdon are quite large. Supplement the diet of the people of Lonelywood with some crab meat.
Ol' Crag Claw^70^Ol' Crag Claw's Claw^Lonelywood^Catti-brie^Lonelywood^^^Take Ol' Crag Claw's Claw to Catti-brie^Ol' Crag Claw prowled the deepest parts of the Lonelywood, killing any living thing that crossed his path. The people of Lonelywood will be a little safer now.
Blacklake Job Faire^15^A flyer in Protector's Enclave.^Protector's Enclave^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^^^Check out the Job Faire in the Blacklake District.^This grimy handbill says: Are you prepared to make THOUSANDS of gold an hour? Do you want the OPPORTUNITY to make not just MONEY, but MEMORIES? Omin Dran wants YOU** Want to know more? Come to the JOB FAIRE in the BLACKLAKE DISTRICT! **To perform dangerous labor for minimal pay.
Acquisitions Incorporated Orientation^16^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Blacklake Job Faire^^Complete the Acquisitions Incorporated Orientation^Orientation is down in the basement - we've crafted an Acquisitions Incorporated experience that's top of the line. I'll meet you down there. Here's a Stone of Sending which will allow Acq Inc members to contact you. They're usually twenty gold, but don't worry. I'll take it out of your check.
Dungeon Maintenance^70^Jim Darkmagic^Protector's Enclave^Jim Darkmagic^Protector's Enclave^Acquisitions Incorporated Orientation^^Investigate the Acquisitions Incorporated Orientation^We've got some new interns down in the orientation that haven't returned yet. Can you go down and check on them? Or pull their bodies out of the mechanisms at least? It might end up being a little bit of both.
Basement Investigation^70^Jim Darkmagic^Protector's Enclave^Jim Darkmagic^Protector's Enclave^Acquisitions Incorporated Orientation^^Retrieve Jim's Documents^Omin told me to go downstairs and find some very special papers, and now I'm telling YOU to go find them. Find the most important papers you can find and bring them up here.
A Lesson in Infiltration^60^Harper Boward^Well of Dragons^Harper Boward^Well of Dragons^^^Acquire Thayan Wizard Gear^The Harpers wish to infiltrate the Thayans' operations in order to gather information about their plans. The Red Wizards' arcane expertise makes any sort of magical disguise easy to see through, but a more mundane approach may work. If you can acquire the Thayan Wizard gear from their camp and bring it back to us, we should be able to piece together some convincing disguises. You should be able to gather it either from defeating Red Wizards, or raiding their supplies.
Castle Ravenloft^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^^^Rescue Ireena from Strahd's Clutches^Ireena's nightmares have become reality. Strahd has abducted and taken her to Castle Ravenloft. He wishes to make her his bride. With the Sunsword and other relics in hand, you must approach the castle and find Ireena. If Madam Eva is to be believed, you are the one who can free her from the count's clutches. Please, take my Vistani heirloom and deliver it to her. If you succeed, Ireena will be able to leave Barovia and escape Strahd forever. 
The Devil's Due^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Castle Ravenloft^^Go to Castle Ravenloft and defeat Strahd von Zarovich^Ireena is safe and I will wager that Strahd is worried. We must act now, before he has time to marshall his forces. It is a shame that he learned you have the Sunsword. I can only imagine that he is planning something to regain it from you. Strike while the iron is hot, NAME and take the fight to Strahd. With the other relics, perhaps you can defeat him once and for all, to save Barovia.
Fangstorm's Fur^^Fangstorm's Fur^Bryn Shander^Huntsman Jorl^Bryn Shander^^^Return Fangstorm's Fur to Huntsman Jorl outside of Bryn Shander.^You've received a patch of fur from a wild beast that the locals refer to as "Fangstorm". You've heard a Huntsman named Jorl would pay a fine price for items such as this. 
Company Yargo^42^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Ranger Leokas^Pirate's Skyhold^^^Fly to the floating island of Pirates' Skyhold and assist Company Yargo's expedition.^Suspended in air near Neverwinter is an island called Pirates' Skyhold. For years, brutal pirates sailed their skyships from that floating hideaway, preying on merchants and villages all along the Sword Coast. Then suddenly,  a few decades ago, the raids stopped. No one knows why. I don't know if you've ever seen a skyship before. Most people haven't. They were made in Halruaa, a kingdom destroyed by the Spellplague. Company Yargo has one of the few skyships left. They hope to acquire more by raidning Pirates' Skyhold. One of their recruiters can arrange for their skyship to shuttle you up there.
Information Acquisition^35^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^^^Get information about the Heart of Fire.^It's time to aquire yet again! This time we need to ask an ice giant about the Heart of fire. When you're ready to join me head to the ship...
Fallen Logs^44^Benedict Shadeleaf^Pirates' Skyhold^Benedict Shadeleaf^Pirates' Skyhold^^A Hundred Proofs^Collect Bartholemew Blackdagger's Log Books in the Market Square in Pirates' Skyhold.^If you're who I think you are, I was expecting you. Our mutual, cloaked friend believes there are caches of log books out here, written by none other than Bartholemew Blackdagger! When I heard Captain Yargo was going to scout the island by skyboat, I was the first to volunteer. Unfortunately, she doesn't want me taking chances. That's what mercenaries are here for, she says. The books are hidden around the Market Square. They're coded, but I happen to know all Blackdagger's codes. Bring the books to me, I'll decode them, and we can move on to the next thing.
A Hundred Proofs^44^Benedict Shadeleaf^Pirates' Skyhold^Benedict Shadeleaf^Pirates' Skyhold^Fallen Logs^^Acquire documents from a Treasure Chest near the entrance to the Pirate Kings' Lair in Pirates' Skyhold.^We're almost done here. The log books suggest the objective that our firned sent us here for can be found in an old footlocker on an earth mote shard floating northeast of the Docks. I think it's the one with teh massive, crashed skyship sticking out of it. So you know what to look for, our friend wants a sheaf of documents. Don't read them, just bring them to me, yeah? And keep your eyes peeled. The owner of the documents probably won't part willingly with them, dead or alive.
Pirate King's Retreat^45^Norver the Cook^Pirates' Skyhold^^^^^Enter the Pirate King's Retreat and defeat Bartholomew Blackdagger to claim his treasure.^Below the docks are tunnels leading to an underground fortress. That's where Bartholomew Blackdagger is, along with his plunder and his ship, the Black Scourge. These undead pirates were our friends once. They don't deserve this fate. If Blackdagger were put out of his miserable unlife, that might break the curse on the rest of his crew. They could finally rest. So, what do you say? If you take out Pirate King Blackdagger, everyone gets what they want. You get his loot, Captain Yargo gets his ship, and we get to leave this island.
For You Heroic Deeds^49^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^Florin Icehammer  ^Icespire Peak^A Hand Above^^Receive your reward from Florin Icehammer for slaying Skrýmir.^Orreft and I received a communication from Erren saying that you've slain Skrýmir, the leader of Hrimnir's Hands? That was well done. Having him out of the way will certainly help our efforts, and your actions in this matter deserve a reward.
Company of Wolves^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Szoldar Szoldarovich^Barovia^Pack of Lies^^Go to the Howling Hills and find the missing villagers.^It seems the werewolves have begun to form a new pack in the Howling Hills. Villagers who were collecting firewood in the woods have not returned. I don't have to tell you how dangerous these lands can be, but I would appreciate your help in trying to find the missing villagers. Szoldar is coordinating the search. Talk to him inside.
Shadow of Strahd^70^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Vikov Ulrich^Blood on the Vine Tavern^Lost in the Ruins^^Wait until night, then show the Symbol of Ravenkind to Curious Barovians to root out and defeat Strahd's Spies around the Village of Barovia. Collect ciphers from them, then use the ciphers to track down and lure out Strahd's Master Spy.^The eyes of Strahd are everywhere! There are spies who disguise themselves as regular Barovians at night, then report back to a master spy during the day on anything they hear. Now that you have the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, you can use it against them. Wait until night, then seek out any curious Barovians you can find and show them the symbol. They know Strahd wants it, and they will attempt to seize it from you! Collect ciphers from the spies, then locate and defeat the master spy!
Insanity Spreads^51^Quorthon^The Chasm^Quorthon^The Chasm^^^Hunt down and destroy members of Order of Blue Fire in Unhallowed Grounds.^You're a wizard. Perhaps you've studied the Spellague and its effect? I hardly need remind you that the wild magic you see spreading down here will cripple our ability to wield magic if left unchecked. That is why I have created this bulkwalk against chaos, and while I stand there is hope that Neverwinter will not be overrun. The Unhallowed Grounds, however, have become a problem. The aberrant energies flowing from deeper within the chasm aree concentrated there, and I have had to place physical wards to aid my abjurations. The wards weaken ove rtime. Would you mind strengthening them?
Lost in the Ruins^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Pack of Lies^The Old Mill^Talk to Vikov Ulrich, then search the Ruins of Berez for signs of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.^The omens you have gathered seem to indicate the location of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind! From these omens, I suspect it's located somewhere in the ruins of Berez. Talk to Vikov. He knows those lands well and may be able to help you locate the symbol.
Healing the Corruption^70^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^Ezmerelda d'Avenir^Barovia^^^Use the purification potion to heal the corrupted soil in the Whispering Wood. Destroy the source of the corruption.^I have been working with Danika Dorokova on a means to heal the corruption propagated by the druids in the Whispering Wood. She has come up with a potion of purification to cleanse the evil that permeates the very soil. Go to the Whispering Wood and look for where the druids are corrupting the soil. Pour the potion to cleanse it, then destroy the source of the corruption.
Convention Inflitration^45^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Information Acquisition^Reptilian Extraction^You're going undercover. That do anything for you?^There's a super-secret beholder convention that happens every so often in Mantol-Derith, and the next one is right around the corner. We have the perfect disguise to get you in there, but it needs some work. Get the disguise from Jim, get it fixed up in Mantol-Derith, and talk to our man Grazilaxx about the location. I need you to find out as much as you can at this thing. I've got some hunches that need proving out. Oh. Did I mention you're going to a beholder convention? Because you're absolutely going to a beholder convention.
Messy Work^51^Quorthon^The Chasm^^The Chasm^^^Collect Plaguechanged Samples displaying deep alterations to the subject.^If you are not repulsed by some grisly field work, I have a task for you. I am observing many new mutations in the plaguechanged. I have my suspicions as to what may have caused these changes. The plaguechanged seem to be modified intentionally, but I am going to need samples of their bones to confirm. I know it's barbaric to butcher for bones, but I assure you thare is no other way with my limited equipment. You're welcome to examine them for yourself, see what conclusions you come to. I would be willing to compare notes, if you like.
Reptilian Extraction^55^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Convention Inflitration^Temple Intrusion^Rescue the Lizardfolk informant, Jaza.^Listen, we're getting close to something I've been working on for a while, and I want you there when it starts to get messy. There's a lizardfolk in a cell somewhere up in Pirate's Skyhold. It was his tribe that made the temple we're after in Chult; he's sure to know about a secret way in. Walnut will join you once she finishes filling out the correct forms. Go to the airship when you're ready to bust this guy out.
Temple Intrusion^65^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Omin Dran^Protector's Enclave^Reptilian Extraction^Renaer's Salvation^Acquire the Heart of Fire Gem.^I think we've cracked it wide open! Now, we know there's a temple in Chult that has a real gem called the Heart of Fire. We have a secret entrance to it, and most of the heavy hitters in security are still away. If there was a time to get in, get out, and get rich, it's now. Jaza will guide you to the correct place and Walnut will make sure you two follow the Employee Handbook.
The Return To Sharandar^80^Iliyasha Guidingstar^Protectors Enclave^Merrisara Winterwhite^New Sharandar^Summons From The Iliyanbruen^What Was Lost^Travel to Old Sharandar to Investigate the Fey Crossing and reconnect with the Iliyanbruen.^This is an urgent matter, as we recently lost contact with the Iliyanbruen of New Sharandar. Any who attempt a journey to the fey crossing fail to return. We believe someone of your power will be necessary to make the journey safely. Your experience has shown that you can survive great challenges, so we have faith you will be able to reconnect the fey crossing. What do you say? Can we count on you to aid us in this time of great need?
What Was Lost^80^Merrisara Winterwhite^New Sharandar^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^The Return To Sharandar^Wrongfully Wrought^Help locate the missing Iliyanbruen Dignitary in the Ruins^Something about this feels wrong. My most able scout Gathir is presently attending to other tasks. Would you be interested in doing a bit of investigative work? I am most interested in learning the fate of my dignitary. Maybe their disappearance is related to a new threat in the area? Please share your findings with Legaeth Songscythe, as he will be handling matters pertaining to the ruins.
Wrongfully Wrought^80^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Casardil the Wright^New Sharandar^What Was Lost^Under Pressure^Collect Iron Trinkets from Bashin' Ordur! camps.^It's odd, they're all cast from iron and are of the same shape. I am very interested in seeing if we can obtain some of these for study. Bring some of them back to our smith Casardil, he will know what to do. You can find him on Kehl Skywatcher's Plaza, may she never be forgotten.
Under Pressure^80^Casardil the Wright^New Sharandar^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Wrongfully Wrought^Scouting Party^Share your findings with Legaeth Songscythe in New Sharandar.^Cold forged trinkets are uncommon in these lands. My knowledge of magic is limited, but I can say the craftsmanship doesn't match that of ogres or trolls... You may want to share this information with Legaeth.
Scouting Party^80^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Under Pressure^Break Out^Collect Battle Pans from Redcap Strategists.^While Thradisar was studying those iron trinkets, I spent some time thinking about what Casardil said. I find it odd that the creatures inhabiting the old Ruins of Malabog are carrying these around, yet they did not create them. I think your previous assumptions were correct. These are simply worker bees from some sort of hive. Bluntly put, there has to be something or someone more powerful in charge here. I wonder if Malabog has somehow returned? I suggest you return to the ruins yourself and search for clues to help us figure out who is behind this. What do you say?
Break Out^80^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Scouting Party^Master-at-Arms^Free elves from cages^We will need all the help we can get in the coming days. Freeing the prisoners you spotted is a good starting point. To think of citizens trapped in cages and wrongfully imprisoned... why, it makes me sick to my stomach! Assuming the remnants of Malabog's forces are actually capable of creating a lock, I would look for whomever holds the keys to the cages and free the trapped elves.
Master-at-Arms^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Break Out^Uncovering the Threat^Defeat the Captain Rokkgut of the Ruins^Gathis sends word that he has located the leader of these brutes, Rokkgut, out in the ruins. We cannot allow this threat to grow unchecked. Merrisara isn't ready for a direct strike, however she's open to adventurer assistance. My hope is that defeating that fomorian will be enough. We stopped Malabog, we can stop Rokkgut too. We need you to travel deep into the ruins, find Rokkgut, and defeat him. Doing so will throw this so-called "Bashin' Ordur" rabble into chaos, and buy us the time we need to ready our forces. This could stop them altogether. What say you?
Uncovering the Threat^80^Legaeth Songscythe^New Sharandar^Merrisara Winterwhite^New Sharandar^Master-at-Arms^^Confront Granny Necksnapper in her lair.^The Arcane Collective uncovered some grave news regarding the iron trinkets you brought me a while back. After poring over countless ancient tomes, they believe the trinkets were forged by an ancient hag! It is said hags from the Feywild give tokens to their minions and whisper commands through them. The magic has since faded from the tokens, so the hag clearly knows we are on to her. Rokkgut was just a lieutenant sent to keep her hidden from prying eyes. In all likelihood, this hag has been hiding in plain sight for some time. You will need to confront her inside of her lair. Remain vigilant though, hags are conniving, smart, and incredibly dangerous. Facing her will not be easy. You have been warned.
Unfinished Business^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Return to Granny Necksnapper's lair and confront her.^Granny Necksnapper is at large yet she plans to use magic to alter the past. The Arcane Collective believes she has a wish spell and is attempting to use it! You will need to head back to Old Sharandar to prevent her from breaking the fey crossing again.
Three's Company^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat the Bashin' Ordur! Taskmasters^Our scouts have identified three powerful fomorians set to lead the charge against the Iliyanbruen. They must be eliminated immediately, to which end we could use your assistance. Scout Captain Gathir has given us their most recent locations, which we will mark on your map. They will be patrolling the area, so you may have to search a bit to find them. Good luck, and may Corellon guide you.
Wicked Arms^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Collect Tainted Weapons in the Ruins of Malabog.^Malabog has been gone for some time thanks to the hard work of adventurers like you. We are forever grateful, however his legacy has left scars upon the land. His cursed weapons continue to train the Feywild, twisting and warping all that exists around them. We need to recover these weapons so they can be destroyed, lest they fall into enemy hands.
Burning Desire^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Burn the Bashin' Ordur catapult in the Ruins of Malabog.^I've been hearing reports that these Bashin' Ordur louts have acquired siege weapons? A catapult in their hands would be disastrous! I will need to request your assistance in this matter. Our forces are stretched thin with preparations to stand against a potential assault on New Sharandar. Travel out to the ruins, locate this catapult, and destroy it. We will make sure you are properly rewarded.
Powerfully Dim^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Cyclopes in the Ruins of Malabog.^Deep in the ruins are some of the most powerful creatures in Bashin' Ordur's line-up. The cyclopes, while not the most intelligent creatures, they are a very powerful foe. We need to take a few of these out to weaken their forces.
Sugar and Spice^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Add spices to Bashin' Ordur stew cauldrons.^We have devised a plan to waylay the Bashin' Ordur's forces and buy more time. The Arcane Collective has concocted a blend of sleeping spices that we can use to pacify the loutish beasts. Take some of these spices to the ruins and add some to their cauldrons. That should stall them for at least a tenday.
Break Out^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Free elves from cages.^News from outside our sanctuary indicates that the Bashin' Ordur still has some prisoners in their custody. We must get to them as soon as possible. Retrieve keys from troll jailers and free as many of our people as you can.
Unveiled Darkness^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Collect Mysterious Charms from Animated Darkness creatures.^The Arcane Collective recently shared some grave news with the council. In addition to the Bashin' Ordur, shadowy creatures that straddle this world and another have established a presence within the ruins. Thradisar has provided some magic torches you can use to pull these creatures into the Feywild where they can be defeated. We don't need further complications, take some torches and eliminate this threat.
Greenbacks^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Trolls in the Ruins of Malabog.^Foul smelling. Strong. Fast Healing. Trolls. These are the backbone of the Bashin Ordur forces in the ruins and are a constant problem, as they are difficult to kill. Thin their numbers and report back, we shall ensure you are rewarded.
Charmed, I'm Sure^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Break the charm on Iliyanbruen elves.^Thradisar informed me that some Iliyanbruen have fallen sway to dark magic in the ruins. It appears as though they have been enthralled by the trolls and redcaps there! Thradisar says this wand of dispel magic can be used to free them from the grasp of this enchantment. Could we enlist your help once more? "
Mouth for War^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat War Trolls and Redcap Powries in the Ruins of Malabog.^The War Trolls in the Ruins of Malabog have been blocking the roads in the region. We ask that you eliminate a few of these and their Redcap Powrie minions to assist us in freeing up passage.
Rotting on the Vine^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Fell Trolls and Redcap Witherers in the Ruins of Malabog^It appears that the Bashin' Ordur ranks are filled with Fell Trolls that have been slaying our rangers scouting the area. The Council of Iliyanbruen asks for your assistance in dealing with these creatures in the region.
Tribal Musings^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Troll Shamans, Redcap Thorns and Giantsouls.^Some of the hex and curse magic placed upon the Iliyanbruen in the ruins is the work of troll shamen in the region. Displace them along with a few of the more powerful Redcaps and we will compensate you for your time.
Wrongfully Wrought^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Collect Iron Trinkets from Bashin' Ordur camps.^Legaeth told me about those strange objects you found out in the old Ruins of Malabog. Do you have time to obtain a few more of them for me? I don't have soldiers to spare for the task right now myself, but we'll make it worth your time if you are willing to assist us.
Mark of the Crone^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Collect Iron Teeth from troll shamans.^It seems Bashin' Ordur Shamans are carrying around large metal teeth with markings similar to those iron trinkets you found. We would like to obtain more of these teeth, molars to be exact, for study and research. If you come across any in the ruins, please deliver them back to me. It would be much appreciated.
Redcaps^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Redcaps in the Ruins of Malabog^Of all the creatures in the Bashin' Ordurs group, there are none more frustrating and devious than the Redcaps. Redcaps are homicidal fey creatures born of blood lust. Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret. Purge the ruins of a few and we shall gladly reward you.
An Important Invitation^20^Letter behind Sgt. Knox^Protector's Enclave^Durnan^Yawning Portal^Boons, Campaigns, and Adventures^Dispatch and Release^Meet with Lord Neverember in the Moonstone Mask^Esteemed <name>, I hope this letter finds you well. You have accomplished great deeds in the service of the people on many occasions. Your experience and skills are required once again. Please report to the Moonstone Mask at your earliest opportunity.

Dispatch and Release^20^Durnan^Yawning Portal^Anton^Catacombs^An Important Invitation^Heirloom - Stage Left^Find and rescue Anton from the Undertakers^Someone went down into the Catacombs, and he should have returned by now. His name is Anton, and I suspect the Undertakers got him. I need someone to help him escape. You look like you can handle that sort of thing. What do you say?
Heirloom - Stage Left^20^Anton^Catacombs^Durnan^Yawning Portal^Dispatch and Release^Meet Threestrings^Retrieve Durnan's Lost Heirloom from the Undertakers' secret cache.^Durnan loaned me an... heirloom for good luck. He's had it since he was a kid. So I promised him I would return it. But the lousy Undertakers took it, along with everything else. You'll know it when you see it. The guards talk about a treasure cache hidden... "backstage." That's the only clue I have for you. There's a secret passage in the south wall of this room. Don't worry about me. When everyone's looking at you, I'll slip away. Good luck, and thanks again.
Meet Threestrings^20^Durnan^Yawning Portal^Threestrings^Yawning Portal^Heirloom - Stage Left^Meet Gaar Haeliath^Meet the Bard in the Yawning Portal^Threestrings has been looking for an eager and capable adventurer. But since I can't find any, I'm sending you... Ha ha! I'm only pullin' your leg! You've proven yourself resourceful and discreet, <name>. The Bard has something special in the works and I think you can help him out.
Meet Gaar Haeliath^20^Threestrings^Yawning Portal^Gaar Haeliath^Catacombs^Meet Threestrings^A Revenant's Arrangement^Take Threestring's letter to Gaar Haelieth in Catacombs, near the monster cells^I have an acquaintance who... dwells in the Catacombs. His name is Gaar Haeliath and he's a... friend of mine. I need someone to take a letter to him and ask if there's any news for me. He's very old and might need a little help with some things. You seem to be able to handle yourself in the Catacombs. Please do what you can to help him out. Will you lend your assistance and your discretion? We will make it worth your while.
A Revenant's Arrangement^20^Gaar Haeliath^Catacombs^Threestrings^Yawning Portal^Meet Gaar Haeliath^Fragments of Fortune^Help Gaar Haeliath get revenge on the Undertakers and the Xanathar^I need you to strike out at each of the two gangs disguised as the other. First as a Guild member, then as an Undertaker. I will magically alter your appearance for each sortie. When you have retired enough from each group, your task will be complete and I will return you to your... normal visage. I have valuable information for Threestrings and I will reward you as well. Are you ready to attack the Undertakers?
Fragments of Fortune^70^Threestrings^Yawning Portal^Sketches^Catacombs^A Revenant's Arrangement^A Tribute Lost and Found^Search the upper Xanathar Hall for guild missives^First of all, my real name is Mattrim and I am a Harper agent. We need you to help us learn more about the portals into Undermountain. The guild conceals their treasures so well that they forget where the caches lie. They tend to write down cryptic hints and carry them to help them remember. The Harpers ask you to obtain these notes by any means necessary. When you have collected at least twelve of them, take them to Sketches, our halfling contact on the inside. He can pour over the missives to help find the Xanathar tribute cache.
A Tribute Lost and Found^70^Sketches^Catacombs^Threestrings^Yawning Portal^Fragments of Fortune^What Lies Below^Find the Xanathar Guild's Tribute Cache^I got it! OK, OK, here we go! Lemme mark your map... here's where their goodies are hidden... in the bottom level of their Guild hall. They have some pretty scary beasties guarding it. Once you're down there, look for the treasure cache. It'll be hidden in one of the graves on the wall. Bring what you find back to Threestrings, and he'll know what to do with it... now shoo, shoo, before you catch the ogre's eye!
What Lies Below^20^Threestrings^Yawning Portal^Azuli Tefnek^Twisted Caverns^A Tribute Lost and Found^Halaster's Riddle^Complete the Expedition to Twisted Caverns.^This Xanathar tribute speaks of something called the "Gatestaff of Undermountain". According to the information here, this Gatestaff was created by Halaster and is capable of opening portals from within Undermountain to all of Faerun. These must be the same portals people have been disappearing into! I have Harper agents in Wyllowwood who reported sightings of an object that sounds like this Gatestaff. Unfortunately, the way to Wyllowwood has been sealed, and my agents there have been cut off. The only way to reach Wyllowwood now is through the Arch Gate in Twisted Caverns. I've heard Obaya Uday is sponsoring an expedition to Twisted Caverns, and I'm sure she would welcome the contribution of one as capable as you, <name>.
Halaster's Riddle^20^Arch Gate Plaque^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^What Lies Below^Experimental Fumes, Alchemist's Assistant^Find a way to Wyllowwood.^The plaque glows with magical text. "Reaching Wyllowwood doesn't take much. All you need is an aboleth's touch."
Living Spores^20^Una Soverson^Twisted Caverns^Una Soverson^Twisted Caverns^Halaster's Riddle^^Collect Myconid Spores from Myconids.^Oh good, a fellow traveler. As you can see my companion is currently... incapacitated. Fortunately, this has given me some free time. Now that I have first-hand experience with Myconids, I would love to know more about them. If you could bring me some samples it would be great for my research
Experimental Fumes^20^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Halaster's Riddle^Crystal Cave^Gather Sulfur Minerals from geysers in the Cavern Depths.^I have been experimenting with all kinds of substances to cure the kuo-toa. There is one material that I have yet to test. In the Cavern Depths there are geysers venting strange chemicals. The surrounding minerals can be dissolved into a gaseous state. Be careful not to breathe any of the fumes. They are known to cause quite powerful hallucinations. Be on your guard, the Cavern Depths is a dangerous place and everything down there will try to kill you. "Hope they don't die. I hope they don't die."
Alchemist's Assistant^20^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Halaster's Riddle^Crystal Cave^Collect Aboleth Slime from Mind-Controlled Kuo-Toa at Slimy Alcove.^I've been working on a cure for the kuo-toa, but I am missing a few ingredients. With the aboleth's minions around, it's too dangerous for me to get them myself. "Pests!" The first ingredient we need is aboleth slime. The mind-controlled kuo-toa are covered in it! Slay them and fill these vials with the slime. Don't feel bad, their minds are already gone.
Crystal Cave^20^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Experimental Fumes, Alchemist's Assistant^Lethal Remedy, Whip Lash^Use the Alchemist's Potion to absorb the energy in the Cave of Crystals.^Across the Slimy Alcove is a lab I made in the Cave of Crystals. I was using the crystals' latent energy to charge a potion when they became unstable. I had to abandon my work and relocate here. "What a waste." Take the potion to the Cave of Crystals. Hold it high in the air to absorb all the energy. "It could kill them."
Whip Lash^20^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Crystal Cave^Something Fishy^Kill problematic Mind-Controlled Kuo-Toa at Slimy Alcove.^The aboleth's servants are slow and clumsy. I can slip past most of them with ease but there are a handful of problematic kuo-toa that would catch me if I tried any funny business. If you took care of them, I could finally be self-sufficient. "And return to my search."
Lethal Remedy^20^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Crystal Cave^Something Fishy^Test the Alchemist's potion on Mind-Controlled Kuo-Toa at Slimy Alcove.^As I mentioned, the potion is done. At least I think. Before we use it on the sick kuo-toa, we should test it first. Now unless you want to volunteer, we are going to need test subjects. Who better than the mind-controlled kuo-toa? Take these vials to the Slimy Alcove and throw it at them. Tell me what happens. I can't wait to hear about it.
Something Fishy^20^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Lethal Remedy, Whip Lash^Potent Potions^Bring the cure to Sloopul.^We are ready! Bring the potion to Sloopul, he is with the other survivors. Be sure to tell them that The Alchemist sends his regards, I don't want them to see me like this. "They would try to eat me again." I am so happy we were able to put our differences aside and work together. Good luck out there. "Surface dwellers always smell strange."
Potent Potions^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Something Fishy^Legendary Artifacts, Heroes of Yore^Give the cure to Sick Kuo-Toa at the Grotto of Madness.^When the river monster came, dead fish washed up on the short. They were very tasty. But then I didn't feel so good. Archpriest Noogaloop took everyone who wasn't sick to go hunt the monster. With your help, we can go join them. I will cure everyone here, but I need you to save some of the others that got left behind.
Heroes of Yore^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Potent Potions^Master of Wind, Master of Earth, Master of Water^Examine the Pictographs at the Grotto of Madness.^We have carvings of our greatest warriors. We know all about them and you should too. Go find these carvings and maybe you will pick up a few new moves.
Legendary Artifacts^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Potent Potions^Master of Wind, Master of Earth, Master of Water^Gather Legendary Artifacts from enemies at the Grotto of Madness.^We have a huge collection of really powerful items. Most of it got left behind when we retreated here. It would be really helpful if you found them, and I am sure it would please Bulba-Slopp.
Control Gem^^Gem Dropped by the Enemy Torkam Stonesorrow^Twisted Caverns^The Alchemist^Twisted Caverns^Potent Potions^^Ask The Alchemist about the Control Gem.^A mysterious gem on a broken chain. Coated in grime, it seems Twisted Caverns has not been kind to the jewel. Perhaps the Alchemist would be interested in it?
Master of Water^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Tooluga^Twisted Caverns^Legendary Artifacts, Heroes of Yore^The Fourth Master^Learn the Way of Water from Tooluga.^Tooluga is the Master of Water. If you learned about the Way of Water, you could fight much better.
Master of Earth^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Poolpuldopple^Twisted Caverns^Legendary Artifacts, Heroes of Yore^The Fourth Master^Learn the Way of Earth from Poolpuldopple.^Poolpuldopple is the Master of Earth and the wisest person I know. He has never accepted a student, but maybe he will train you in the Way of Earth.
Master of Wind^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Legendary Artifacts, Heroes of Yore^The Fourth Master^Learn the Way of Wind from Floog.^Floog is the Master of Wind and the youngest of all the masters. She gets into all sorts of trouble. You could learn a few things from her... If you can catch her.
The Fourth Master^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Master of Wind, Master of Earth, Master of Water^Island of Bulba-Slopp^Learn the Way of Slime from Sloopul.^You mastered earth, wind, and water, but you still have one element left to learn: the element of slime! And I will be your master! Look around you, what connects everything together? What's the one thing that all this has in common? That's right, slime. Slime is the energy that flows through all of us. To practice the Way of Slime you will have to find me while I hide my energies. Just turn around and count backwards from three. I'm really good at hiding, so you will probably never see me again. I guess this is goodbye.
Island of Bulba-Slopp^20^Sloopul^Twisted Caverns^Arch Gate Plaque^Twisted Caverns^The Fourth Master^Golden Opportunity^Kill the aboleth Illuun and open the Arch Gate to Wyllowwood.^It is time. Go to the Island of Bulba-Slopp, find Archpriest Noogaloop, and slay the river monster. We usually just swim there but you'll have to take an abandoned tunnel to the island. We will meet you there to give you our blessing.
Golden Opportunity^20^Automatically Accepted^Twisted Caverns^Obaya Uday^Yawning Portal^Island of Bulba-Slopp^Into the Wilds^Speak with Obaya Uday in the Yawning Portal^You have unlocked a new arch gate? This is wonderful news! Meet me back in the Yawning Portal as soon as possible.
Into the Wilds^20^Obaya Uday^Yawning Portal^Azuli Tefnek^Wyllowwood^Golden Opportunity^Wicked Gaze, Tangled Web^Complete the Expedition to Wyllowwood^I am pleased to hear you have unlocked a new arch gate. Now we may finally rediscover a route to Wyllowwood! You shall be working with Azuli again as he maps the route you take. He will, of course, stay out of your way as much as possible. As before, I shall pay you handsomely for any magic relics you collect while traveling on the expedition. I would like to emphasize that I will increase my payment based on the number of magic relics you collect. Please be safe, although I understand that is nearly impossible in Undermountain.
Tangled Web^20^Eildi^Wyllowwood^Eildi^Wyllowwood^Into the Wilds^Smoke Signals^Kill Ettercaps in Wyllowwood.^The ettercaps nearby grow more aggressive due to the influx of adventurers from the newly opened portals into Undermountain. I am trying to establish this cave as a base of operations. Push back the beasts as best you can, and hopefully lives will be saved.
Wicked Gaze^20^Eildi^Wyllowwood^Eildi^Wyllowwood^Into the Wilds^Smoke Signals^Investigate the area for Clues.^Some of my agents that I sent to investigate a nearby cave system have yet to return. I need to know what happened to them. I made a promise that I would see them home safely. I cannot go myself, so if you can lend any aid I would be in your debt.
Smoke Signals^20^Eildi^Wyllowwood^Harper Agent's Body^Wyllowwood^Wicked Gaze, Tangled Web^Caustic Clues^Light Signal Fires and move deeper into Wyllowwood^I have not heard from my agents in quite some time. I believe the Cult of Malar is to blame. They are a vicious and merciless beast cult that may in part be the cause of my agents going missing. We set up signal fires deeper into the forest to call one another for aid. Please light as many as you can find and send my agents home.
Caustic Clues^^Harper Agent's Body^Wyllowwood^Ulayra^Wyllowwood^Smoke Signals^Valdemar's Lair^Use scrolls of Neutralize Poison to heal the Wounded Adventurers nearby.^The note found on the Harper reads: 'Take these scrolls of Neutralize Poison and help those wounded by the dragon. If you require aid seek out Ulayra. She is looking for a way into the dragon's lair. Return safely, Eildi' On the Harper's body you find a satchel full of magic scrolls. Adventurers wounded by the dragon's breath cry out around you.
Valdemar's Lair^20^Ulayra^Wyllowwood^Eildi^Wyllowwood^Caustic Clues^Savage Rites, Dangerous Game^Defeat Valdemar in his lair.^This acrid fog... Comes from the cave nearby. Valdemar makes his home in those caverns. I cannot face the dragon like this. You must put an end to him. Don't worry about me... I'll make my way back when I've regained my strength.
Laying them to Rest^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Undead in the Mended Grove.^Dark magics are at work in the Mended Grove. The corpses of long-dead eladrin walk again beneath the trees. Roused from their slumber, these bodies have been reanimated as under servants and pressed into service by the Legion. This indignity to our ancestors cannot be allowed to stand. Travel to the Mended Grove and destroy the undead that wander there, freeing the bodies from the foul magics that bind them to service.
Bring Out the Undead^80^Merrisara Winterwhite^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Uncovering the Threat^The Night Fetish^Collect Fiendish Totems from Undead in the Mended Grove.^Ghastly apparitions haunt the woods, and could undead abominations roam across the forest floor. These are not the works of the mere redcaps and trolls, some other force is moving about the Mended Grove. Your assistance in purging the ruins of Malabog was invaluable, so I would ask your aid once more. Seek out these undead, destroy them, and report back to me with whatever you find.
Ogre Magi^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Oni in the Mended Grove.^Deep in the Ancient Grove lurk the monstrous Oni, easily the strongest of the Tormented Legion's soldiers. These devious giants are also known as Ogre Magi and should not be underestimated. Removing a number of these creatures from the ranks of the legion would go a long way in helping to secure Sharandar's safety.
Cure for the Corrupt^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Corrupted Elves in the Mended Grove.^I am sure that you have noticed the Corrupted Elves during your travels in the Mended Grove. While they serve in the Tormented Legion, these elves were once Illiyanbruen who served Sharandar with pride. Tainted by visions and led down a path of wickedness and foul deeds, these soldiers now swell the ranks of the power in the grove. Seek them out and end their torment, and I shall ensure that you are rewarded.
The Night Fetish^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Bring Out the Undead^Stalking the Stalkers^Destroy Night Fetishes in the Mended Grove.^I have studied the Fiendish Totems, and it is clear to me that they are not of fey origin. Since this lies outside my area of expertise, I recommend speaking with Emare Firesky, the high priestess of Corellon. Perhaps she can better advise you on the next course of action.
Shepherd of the Trees^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Examine Ancient Trees for signs of Blight in the Grove.^The council is concerned that the Tormented Legion's presence within the Mended Grove could cause a resurgence of the Blight. We need someone like you to travel to previously affected areas and examine the trees for any signs of corruption. Can the council depend on you again?
The Night Fetish^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Destroy Night Fetishes in the Mended Grove.^An increasing number of undead creatures are rising in the Mended Grove. Emare has informed me that this activity is tied to enchanted totems known as Night Fetishes. Travel to the grove and destroy as many of these objects as you can find. I will make sure you are rewarded in kind.
The Madness^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Madcaps in the Mended Grove.^As if the homicidal rages of the Redcaps were not bad enough, the Tormented Legion has unleashed scores of Madcaps loose in the Mended Grove. These twisted versions of the Redcaps not only take delight in killing but also corrupting and tainting those who are unfortunate enough to fall under their sway. Purge the grove of a few and we shall gladly reward you.
Bounty: Secrets in the Grove^80^Bounty Board^New Sharandar^Bounty Board^New Sharandar^^^Seek out unique targets in the Grove to gather valuable information.^There have been reports of several unique targets spotted in the Grove. These targets carry valuable information that can help our efforts greatly. While we do not know their specific locations, they are known to be surrounded by some sort of menacing aura. If you come across one please seek it out and retrieve any information you find. targets who are more powerful tend to have more information.
Bounty: Secrets in the Ruins^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Seek out unique targets in the Ruins to gather valuable information.^There have been reports of several unique targets spotted in the Ruins. These targets carry valuable information that can help our efforts greatly. While we do not know their specific locations, they are known to be surrounded by some sort of menacing aura. If you come across one please seek it out and retrieve any information you find. targets who are more powerful tend to have more information.
Stalkers on Six Legs^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Displacer Beasts in the Mended Groves.^The packs of Displacer Beasts in the Mended Grove are disrupting the patrols of the wardens sent to tend to the plants and creatures of the grove. We need you to thin the ranks of these monstrosities to ensure that we can properly tend to the restoration of the mended Grove.
The Hunters^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Corrupted Warriors and Displacer Beasts in the Mended Gvore.^The Tormented Legion is full of dangerous foes, but few are as skilled in woodcraft as the Corrupted Warriors and Displacer Beasts. Many of our forces have been ambushed by these foul creatures. If you could reduce the number of these hunters, it would allow our scouts to travel deeper into the Grove and gather more information about the Legion's movements.
The Nightsworn and the Insane^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Corrupted Warlocks and Madcap Witherers in the Mended Grove.^Twisted by the leaders of the Tormented Legion, the Corrupted Warlocks are the sycophants of the enemy ranks. Their fierce devotion to their strange patron has led them to create Redcaps, only to twist them with unnatural powers into Madcaps. If we can remove these sycophants it will help reduce the legion's numbers.
Masters and Minions^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Oni, Decaying Warriors, and Festering Rangers in the Mended Grove.^There appears to be some form of command structure in the Tormented Legion. In the areas where Oni are located, we see the highest concentration of undead soldiers. The Council of Iliyanbruen believes that this is not a coincidence, and asks for your assistance in dealing with reducing the numbers of Oni and their undead minions in the region.
Stalking the Stalkers^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^The Night Fetish^Oil of Etherealness^Discover what happened to the Missing Scouts in the Mended Grove.^Two of our scouts are long overdue for their shift change. Tardiness is unlike them, so I fear something might have happened. It would be a great help if you could look into the matter. One was assigned to the Ancient Grove, the other to Dragon Falls.
Oil of Etherealness^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Stalking the Stalkers^Hunting the Unseen^Gather the Ingredients for a Potion of Etherealness in the Mended Grove.^It is never a good idea to chase blindly after a foe, especially if they can blink out of existence faster than a falling leaf. Seek out Thradisar, he may know something that will help you confront her.
Hunting the Unseen^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Oil of Etherealness^The Walking Trance^Shatter the Night Hag's Heartstone in the Ethereal Plane.^Take the Oil of Etherealness and travel to the Mended Grove. Once you reach the outskirts, use it to enter the Ethereal Plane and stop Mathilda Soulstealer. We must not let her reach New Sharandar.
Stalking the Stalkers^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Hunt the rogue pack of Displacer Beasts in the Mended Grove.^Our scouts have reported displacer beasts stalking about the Mended Grove. These monstrosities could impede our efforts against the Tormented Legion, so we need you to make quick work of them.
The Walking Trance^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Hunting the Unseen^To Hades and Back Again^Find the Entrance to the Mathilda Soulstealer's Lair in the Mended Grove.^The night hag retreated into the Mended Grove following your encounter. She is likely hiding in her lair, which means we will need to trck her down. Take this sending stone, it will help us stay in touch.
To Hades and Back Again^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^The Walking Trance^A Noble Deed^Defeat Mathilda Soulstealer in her Lair.^Now that we know the location of her lair, we need to bring down the barrier and drive her out of the Feywild. Speak with Thradisar, he will know how to handle this.
The Walking Trance^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Disperse Spirits in the Mended Grove.^We have received reports of wandering spirits assaulting travelers in the Mended Grove. If you are up to the task, we could use your assistance in clearing them out.
Tomb Raiding^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Mathilda Soulstealer in her lair.^That vile hag Mathilda Soulstealer continues to weaver her nightmares in the Feywild. The Arcane Collective Believes she is attempting to use an ancient artifact to restore her control over the Mended Grove! We need you, hero of Neverwinter, to head back to her lair and prevent this madness
Troll Mucus^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Collect Troll Mucus from Trolls in the Ruins of the Malabog.^This is hardly my proudest moment, adventurer, but the Arcane Collective's supply of Troll Mucus is running low. They insist this vile substance is necessary for the potions and wards they use to defend new Sharandar. According to them, the trolls infesting the Ruins of Malabog are the best source of this 'precious' fluid... I suggest you start your search there. Deliver the mucus back to me and I will ensure it is safely transported to the collective. Your help is much appreciated, adventurer.
A Signal from Afar^80^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^Pelendethas Everstride^New Sharandar^^^Light the Iliyanbruen beacons in the Mended Grove.^The eladrin once used beacons to send messages quickly across the Feywild. We utilize these old systems to contact our scouts discretely within the grove. I will mark the beacons on your map. Light them quickly as possible - we need our scouts to report in.
Broken Supply Chain^80^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^Commander Riverwind^New Sharandar^^^Burn crates of Bashin' Ordur! supplies^We must weaken the Bashin Ordur's grasp on the area, but our forces are currently overwhelmed by multiple threats. If you could sabotage some of their supplies, it would greatly slow down their advance and give us the time we need to focus on preparations within New Sharandar.
A Noble Deed^80^Merrisara Winterwhite^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^To Hades and Back Again^Forest Shepherds^Speak to a guest in New Sharandar.^Adventurer, the assistance you have provided us is much appreciated, and your exploits in Faerûn are legendary. Sadly, our work is unfinished. The hags yet run free. Word of the threats here has spread, and a guest has come from Neverwinter They have asked for you by name.
Forest Shepherds^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^A Noble Deed^Uprooting the Problem^Investigate the dryad grove for clues.^I am sure you've heard of the Dryads that were forced from their home in the Dryad Holt region of the Mended Grove. None who have entered that area have returned to report to me. I made an attempt to scout it myself, but... let's say the restless dead were indeed very restless there. I think you will have more luck scouting the area and discovering the cause.
Uprooting the Problem^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Forest Shepherds^Dark Fey Magic^Find the threat in the grove and defeat it.^Petrified Dryads. Hmm. I remember a story Alric told me, about a beat that drained the life from the things it touched. That may be what happened here. This life essence should draw out the creature. Place it near the most recently drained Dryad, but be prepared to defend yourself.
Dark Fey Magic^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Lithoceae the Dryad^New Sharandar^Uprooting the Problem^Walking Dreams^Meet with the Dryad Lithoceae in the Mire.^Untangling this story may be as complicated as destroying that Shambling Mound. The creature you fought was not created by the hags, but by the fen of witches that terrorized the Feywild before the defeat of Malabog. Removing it takes away the last piece of the evil legacy. Lithoceae, a Dryad of some repute, wants to meet with a representative of the council. I think you're the Adventurer for the job. She may help us uncover more of this new threat.
The Salientians^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Grung Wildlings, Shaman and Chieftains in the Dark Fey Mire.^We've attempted to negotiate with the Grung before, but they will not release their captives, and they attack our messengers. A message must be sent, and not in song. Can you do this for me?
Soup of the Day^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Knock over Grung Cauldrons in the Dark Fey Mire.^There are Grung shamans within the Mire, using dark cauldrons to produce evil magicks. If you could clear them of Grung and destroy them, it will help allow the Iliyanbruen to root out the threat in the region.
Horrorticulture^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Shambling Mounds and Corpse Fowers in the Dark Fey Mire.^Care to do a little gardening, Adventurer? There are horticultural horrors out in the Mire, and they need to be pruned lest they continue to prey on adventureres. The Iliyanbruen would like your assistance.
Roll the Bones^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Collect Black Magic Talismans from Grung Shaman in the Dark Fey Mire.^The Arcane Collective has a request for you. In the Mire, there are Grung shamans who can bend the Feywild to their will, using magical talismans. They'd like to study a few of the talismans. Can you retrieve them?

Hypnotize the Toad^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Obtain bait to summon Sir Croak and defeat him.^How do you feel about hunting a myth? The Grung believe an ancient toad, tall as the trees, lurks in the Mire. None of us have seen it. Perhaps if you get fish from the Grung to use as bait, you can draw it out, and prove whether it's real?
A Signal from Afar (Mire)^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Light the Iliyanbruen beacons in the Mire.^Have you seen the beacons in the Ruins of Malabog, and the Mended Grove? Several lie in the Dark Fey Mire, as well. Gathir needs them lit, to recall his scouts throughout the area. The beacons are marked on your map, light all three.
Brute, Smash!^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Trolls and Cyclopses in the Ruins of Malabog.^Commander Riverwind requires some aid in stamping out the Annis hag minions in the Ruins of Malabog. Go trolling there for me, would you?
Bounty: Secrets in the Mire^80^Bounty Board^New Sharandar^Bounty Board^New Sharandar^^^Seek out unique targets in the Mire to gather valuable information.^There have been reports of several unique targets spotted in the Mire. These targets carry valuable information that can help our efforts greatly. While we do not know their specific locations, they are known to be surrounded by some sort of menacing aura. If you come across one please seek it out and retrieve any information you find. targets who are more powerful tend to have more information.
Unfamiliar Fiends^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Shambling Mounds in the Dark Fey Mire.^The Shambling Mounds stalk the mire, dragging unfortunate travelers to a watery grave. Not a fate I'd wish on anyone. The Council of the Iliyanbruen has asked for help in removing these vile beasts.
Sylvan Sycophants^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Defeat Dryads and Twig Blights in the Dark Fey Mire.^The Dryad Holt have come to us for help, but not every Dryad shares their ideals. Out in the Mended Grove, the Festering Holt lurks, along with their Twig Blight minions. The Council has asked adventurers like you to deal with the threat
Renewal^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Plant Seeds of Life in the Mended Grove^Today, the woods themselves require your aid. Dryads have been pushed out of the Dryad Holt in the Mended Grove, and lack the strength to fight for it. One of them gave me a large batch of the enchanted seeds used to heal the woods. If you can plant them about the grove, you could keep it alive until they can return.
The Frog Elf^80^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^Etrien Sael^New Sharandar^^^Dispel polymorph magic on Iliyanbruen elves in the Dark Fey Mire.^Some of the Grungs in the Mire have placed a spell on Iliyanbruen, turning them into toads. Take a dispel scroll, and use it to free them. Unless, of course, they prefer to be toads.
Valindra's Siege^1^Upon starting the game^Neverwinter Fields^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^^Broken Arrow^Put a stop to Valindra's attack.^Valindra and her undead horde are pushing to the very heart of Neverwinter. Sergeant Knox and the Neverwinter guard are doing all they can but they need help.
Training Day^2^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Valindra's Siege^Grave News^Learn the basics of adventuring.^You've proven you can handle yourself, and that makes your membership in this fine Adventurer's Guild all but guaranteed. As a reward for your deeds, I've arranged a few things. Speak with our mount salesman Brendon Canter and then enter the Training Room for some combat training. I'm sure you can still learn a thing or two, and a new skill is worth its weight in gold.
Five Keys to Success^5^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Graveyard at Rest^Company of Wolves^Learn about Lockboxes and Keys, Invoking the Gods, Companions, the Seals Store, and Queues.^With the issues in Neverdeath put to rest, it is high time for you to enjoy the fruits of your efforts. I have arranged for you to speak with several individuals in the Adventurer's Guild who will help further acclimate you to life in Neverwinter. First things first, take these lockboxes as a reward for your efforts.
Into the Wolf Den^7^Hadrik Longtooth^Vellosk^Hadrik Longtooth^Vellosk^Leaders of the Pack, Moonlight & Shadow^Back to the City^Enter the Gray Wolf Den.^The greatest of the Gray Wolf Tribe is the bloodthirsty and greedy Ethraniev Marrowslake. It's she who swore the blood oath to Clariburnus Tanthul, the Prince of Shade, to lead our people against the Thayans. It's because of her our people suffer and die in a pointless war. Marrowlake sits high above us in the maw at the top of the Gray Wolf Den. Use the talismans at the Twilight Crucible and the door to the Gray Wolf Den will open. Enter that ancient place of power and slay her!
Missives, Auctions, and Diamonds^8^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Back to the City^The Haunting of Ebon Downs^Learn about Mail, the Auction House, and Astral Diamonds.^There are many goods and services located throughout Protector's Enclave, and it is high time for you to get to know a bit more about the city that you saved. I have arranged for you to speak with the Postal Courier, the Auctioneer and Rhix the astral diamond merchant.
A New Path^11^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Back Up From Ebon Downs^Peril on Icespire Peak^Learn more about your future as an Adventurer^You're building a name for yourself as a real hero in Neverwinter. I suspect you can feel all new potential to grow stronger. You should speak with your trainer about your choice of Paragon Path.
Artifacts and Insignias^17^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Sergeant Knox^The Adventurer's Guild^Chasm Report^Into the Underdark^Learn about Artifacts and Insignias.^Listen, <name>, it is time for you to learn about some very old and powerful magic items... Artifacts. You should visit Tarhun Delmirev. He has learned the resting place of some of these artifacts and he's afraid that other less desirable researchers may learn the same. Personally, I'd rather have you holding a powerful item rather than some Red Wizard or cultist.
The Loose Thread^20^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Back to the Surface^An Audience with the Protector^Return to the Adventurer's Guild...^I think you've earned yourself some rest back at the Adventurer's Guild. I can't help but think though, that we haven't seen the last of Valindra. That blasted Lich is still out there...
Boons, Campaigns, and Adventures^20^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^An Audience with the Protector^^Learn about Boons and Campaigns.^With your triumph over Valindra, your time in the Adventurer's Guild is almost at an end. I have one last lesson to teach you before you set out seeking adventure.
Savage Rites^20^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Valdemar's Lair^Furious Fangs, Wild Woes^Kill Cultists of Malar.^The cult of Malar hunt the innocent for sport and corrupt the land. We shall not stand for this any longer! Show them what it is like to be hunted.
Dangerous Game^20^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Valdemar's Lair^Furious Fangs, Wild Woes^Save People from the cult^The cult is capturing anyone they can get their hands on. They seem to be working towards some vile end. These Malar fools offend my refined sensibilities. We must bring them to justice! Free those who need saving and cut down those who try to stop you!
Wild Woes^20^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Savage Rites, Dangerous Game^Claws of Malar^Destroy cult Elligies.^The cult continues their vile work. The effigies they built to honor Malar enrage the beasts and cause them to wreak havoc. Destroy the totems so that the animals may find peace once again.
Furious Fangs^20^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Savage Rites, Dangerous Game^Claws of Malar^Calm enraged Beasts with Tearulai's ring.^The cult has used vile magic to curse the animals of the area and send them into a rage. Take this ring and use it to calm the beasts. Please return the forest to a more peaceful state so I can focus on this dragon's memories.
Claws of Malar^20^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Tearulai^Wyllowwood^Furious Fangs, Wild Woes^Ready for Adventure^Defeat the Malar Cultists and seek out Arcturia.^Hero, I have uncovered a new memory that requires our immediate attention. The woman is Arcturia, a powerful lich who is using the magic of that staff to wreak havoc in Undermountain. She has been working with some kind of metal mage to empower the cult. The cultists are gathering for a counterattack, and I expect her to be there. We shall work together to defeat them in Wyllowwood! Wait for nightfall near the tree surrounded by purple lilac flowers.
Ready for Adventure^20^Auto Accepted^Wyllowwood^Obaya Uday^Yawning Portal^Claws of Malar^Hot Pursuit^Find a way to reach Terminus.^Trobriand has travelled to Terminus with the Gatestaff in hand. There is an old arch gate nearby that can be used to pursue him deeper into Undermountain.
Hot Pursuit^20^Obaya Uday^Yawning Portal^Azuli Tefnek^Terminus^Ready for Adventure^A Peace Offering^Complete the Expedition to Terminus Level.^Azuli speaks very highly of you, <name>, and is ready to depart when you are. I hope this new arch gate will lead you to Terminus, which I have been attempting to reach for some time. I hear it is an inhospitable place, but an ancient one with great potential for magic relics. As before, I shall pay you handsomely for any magic relics you collect while on the expedition. Prince O'tamu has been pleased with our success up to this point, and wishes me to convey his thanks for your assistance.
A Peace Offering^20^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Hot Pursuit^To Be Judged^Collect Fomorian Heads in Terminus^You must take care here. This floor is ruled by Fazrian, a ruthless planetar with immense power. His tale is tragic, and you may wish to try to save him, but this is beyond us. His twisted version of justice usually involves destroying any whom he judges unworthy. We need to give Fazrian a reason not to kill you immediately. He likely does not appreciate the nearby fomorians settled in his domain. If you were to dispose of them we may gain Fazrian's favor. It's gruesome, but you'll want proof of your deed. Think of it as a mercy for these fomorians trapped in Terminus by Halaster's whims.
To Be Judged^20^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^A Peace Offering^Proven Guilty, Shoot the Messenger^Meet with Fazrian^You are ready to face Fazrian now. Prepare yourself for the worst, and do not let your guard down. He keeps the company of demons and sycophants most vile. Work with him as best you can, but do not trust him. You will be asked to do regrettable things, but know it advances our greater goal.
Shoot the Messenger^20^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^To Be Judged^Penalty of Death, Bear the Weight, Means of Production^Collect Evidence of Valtagar's betrayal.^There is one among Fazrian's court who plots against him. Valtagar Steelshadow, Lord of the Mines, leads the duergar here. He is working with Trobriand against Fazrian. We need to find proof of Valtagar's plot. Look for duergar traveling with constructs near the mines. They are likely to be carrying sensitive material we can use. When you have gathered enough evidence, show Fazrian the truth of Valtagar's betrayal.
Proven Guilty^20^Fazrian^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^To Be Judged^Penalty of Death, Bear the Weight, Means of Production^Kill Rebellious Demons in Terminus^You now act in service to me. Some demons refuse my rule of law. Go forth and slay them in my name. My servants will also have tasks for you.
It's Elemental^20^Uzrul^Terminus^Uzrul^Terminus^To Be Judged^^Kill Elementals in Terminus^I don't like you. It would be fun to kill you! Fazrian won't let me. Maybe you kill for me? Then I like you.
Penalty of Death^20^Fazrian^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^Proven Guilty, Shoot the Messenger^The Calassabrak, Tools of the Trade^Kill Duergar in Terminus^He will suffer. His people will suffer. They will all be erased. You shall assist me in this. Travel to the mines and kill all you find there. Give them fear as you grant them death. I will deal with those who remain here in the court.
Bear the Weight^20^Raxxus^Terminus^Raxxus^Terminus^Proven Guilty, Shoot the Messenger^The Calassabrak, Tools of the Trade^Use Demonic Bombs to destroy the Shrines to Laduguer^<race>, you work to serve Fazrian? Take these toys of mine and destroy the shrines the duergar have erected for their pathetic god Laduguer. He will be pleased.
Means of Production^20^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Proven Guilty, Shoot the Messenger^The Calassabrak, Tools of the Trade^Destroy Mine Shafts in the Mines^Now that Fazrian has granted us the freedom to do as we wish within his realm, we have the opportunity to disrupt the supply of mithral to Trobriand's forges. Destroy the mine shafts to block their work.
Tools of the Trade^20^Fazrian^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^Penalty of Death, Bear the Weight, Means of Production^Fire and Iron, Destroy the Supply, An Iron Visage^Take Duergar Mining Tools in the Quarry^The duergar think they can rip apart my mountain and take as they wish. They are wrong. I will tolerate their incessant digging no longer. Silence their traitorous work by claiming their tools. See to it that you do not fail me.
The Calassabrak^20^Fazrian^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^Penalty of Death, Bear the Weight, Means of Production^Fire and Iron, Destroy the Supply, An Iron Visage^Kill Valtagar's Elite Guard in Terminus^I should have known not to trust those unworthy fools. The Calassabrak they were called, for crimes against their own. They rejected the rule of their king and worked against him. They do the same to me now. Deal swift justice to the strongest among them to show how weak they have become since abandoning their fealty to me.
An Iron Visage^20^Raxxus^Terminus^Raxxus^Terminus^The Calassabrak, Tools of the Trade^Final Judgement^Collect Iron Masks from Duergar in Terminus^Hello again <race>! The little mining men have interesting masks. If you get me some I might give you something nice from Fazrian's secret stash. He won't mind...
Destroy the Supply^20^Jhesiyra^Terminus^Jhesiyra^Terminus^The Calassabrak, Tools of the Trade^Final Judgement^Destroy Unpowered Constructs in the Forge^Fazrian has told us of Valtagar's wicked factory. We must go there and destroy as many constructs as we can before they are ready for battle. This will deal a great blow to Trobriand's plot.
Fire and Iron^20^Fazrian^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^The Calassabrak, Tools of the Trade^Final Judgement^Destroy Cooling Vents^I questioned some of Valtagar's fools before I dealt wit them. They seem to have built a factory in my domain without my blessing. It must be erased. Do this and we will near the end of my judgement of these creatures.
Final Judgement^20^Fazrian^Terminus^Fazrian^Terminus^Fire and Iron, Destroy the Supply, An Iron Visage^Dark Opportunity^Kill Valtagar^Your work here has brought Valtagar to his knees. He hides away in his chambers and awaits his fate. He is fearful and weak. I wish this to be done quickly. Take this portal to the forges. Become the hand of my judgement. I sentence Valtagar to death.
Dark Opportunity^20^Auto Accepted^Terminus^Obaya Uday^Yawning Portal^Final Judgement^Dark Descent^Find a way to reach Vanrakdoom^A nearby arch gate will lead to Vanrakdoom and allow further pursuit of the Gatestaff of Undermountain.
Dark Descent^20^Obaya Uday^Yawning Portal^Azuli Tefnek^Vanrakdoom^Dark Opportunity^A Fresh Face^Join the Expedition to Vanrakdoom.^All reports indicate this arch gate will provide us with a reliable route to Vanrakdoom. I have heard tales of a great darkness residing there, so I hope you will be cautious and keep Azuli safe. As before, I shall pay you handsomely for any magic relics you collect while on the expedition. I hope we can maintain this mutually beneficial relationship well into the future. Everything is prepared, but a nobleman here in the Yawning Portal wishes to speak with you before your departure. Speak to Azuli when you are ready to begin the expedition.
A Fresh Face^20^Jhesiyra^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Dark Descent^Dressed to Kill^Meet the Worshipers of Selûne.^I had hoped never to return to Vanrakdoom. It's a cruel, miserable place, controlled by the Cult of Shar. But something's changed. There are worshipers of Selûne battling the cultists... They aren't going to win. If the constructs are being sent here, Trobriand must be working with the cultists in some way. We need to find out what they are doing and put an end to it.
Dressed to Kill^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Keresta Delvingstone^Vanrakdoom^A Fresh Face^Loose Ends, Spring Cleaning^Collect Shar Clothes from Shar Cultists.^We have taken heavy losses and still don't know what the cultists are plotting. How can I give my men hope when they don't even know what they are fighting for! What they are dying for. It is risky, but if you were to disguise yourself as a cultist you could learn what they are up to. Their living quarters are not far from here. Find some robes and report to their leader.
Spring Cleaning^20^Keresta Delvingstone^Vanrakdoom^Keresta Delvingstone^Vanrakdoom^Dressed to Kill^Shattering Revelation^Kill Mindless Undead.^We are working with a powerful mage by the name of Trobriand. We offer him our services, and in return we are supplied with bodies. My spawn have all the blood they can drink, and we have raised far more undead than my necromancers can control. Perhaps I have been too soft on them. Our basement runs rampant with undead. Slay them until my necromancers can take control of those that remain.
Loose Ends^20^Keresta Delvingstone^Vanrakdoom^Keresta Delvingstone^Vanrakdoom^Dressed to Kill^Shattering Revelations^Kill Shar Initiate Belora.^I'm afraid we don't have room for any more recruits. So if you want to join, you'll have to kill another member of our organization. I sent an initiate to clear the undead in the basement, but she hasn't returned. Based on the way she begged not to go down there, I'm guessing she hid from her responsibilities. Belora was her name, I believe... pretty little thing. Our shadow dragon hasn't had fresh meat in some time, and he grows insufferable. When you have disposed of Belore, be sure to feed her remains to Umbraxakar.
Shattering Revelation^20^Keresta Delvingstone^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Loose Ends, Spring Cleaning^Out of Control, Soul Thief, Keresta's Muscle^Deliver keresta's Shipment.^I am satisfied with your recruitment. Now for you to take on some real responsibility. There are crates in storage that need to be delivered to the Conversion Chambers. The cargo is extremely fragile, so do be careful. Your life depends on it. I have some other business to attend to. I will be leaving the rest of my orders with Thagor.
Out of Control^20^Belora^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Shattering Revelation^Deconstruction, Salvation of Souls, Twisted Bindings^Unleash Undead by killing Necromancers.^You helped Keresta with the undead right? By now her necromancers will have a small army at their disposal. If you target these necromancers, the undead will return to their mindless, rampaging state, wreaking havoc behind the enemy lines.
Keresta's Muscle^20^Belora^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Shattering Revelation^Deconstruction, Salvation of Souls, Twisted Bindings^Kill Thagor and steal Keresta's Orders.^Keresta doesn't like other members giving out orders. She views it as a challenge to her leadership. Since she can't be everywhere at once, she leaves instructions for us to complete while she is gone. Her pet yeti, Thagor, guards the orders. Slay him, retrieve the documents, and you will discover what they are doing for Trobriand.
Soul Thief^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Shattering Revelation^Deconstruction, Salvation of Souls, Twisted Bindings^Collect Soul Shards from Shar Cultists in the Halls of Worship.^They had gems with souls trapped inside? I knew they were committing heinous acts, but I underestimated how far they would go. I need you to bring back a few of these soul shards so I can examine them myself. Hopefully, I can dispose of them safely.
Deconstruction^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Out of Control, Keresta's Muscle, Soul Thief^Origins of Evil^Stop Constructs Activations in the Conversion Chambers.^If the cultists didn't build the constructs, they probably don't really understand how they work. It seems like only the duergar can activate constructs using soul shards. You need to stop them.
Salvation of Souls^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Out of Control, Keresta's Muscle, Soul Thief^Origins of Evil^Free Prisoners in Conversion Chambers.^I've been a fool. The vision I had of Undermountain... it wasn't Selûne. It was intended to draw me here to be captured by these constructs. I knew others were having visions, but something in me still believe in what I saw. They will regret luring us here. Selûne watch over me, we will retaliate for this manipulation! Find a key to the jail cell, and free those who were taken.
Twisted Bindings^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Out of Control, Keresta's Muscle, Soul Thief^Origins of Evil^Kill Soul-Slavers in the Conversion Chambers.^Only a few within the Cult of Shar have the ability to trap souls inside gems. Go to the Conversion Chambers and defeat these Soul-Slavers.
Origins of Evil^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Far-Scout Davril^Vanrakdoom^Deconstruction, Salvation of Souls, Twisted Bindings^Peace of Mind, Shadow Vigil^Use Celeste's Amulet to find the source of Dark Magic.^There is great magic at work here. Something is empowering the Shar cultists, making them strong enough to creat soul shards. We must find the source of this dark power and destroy it. Take my amulet, Selûne's light will reveal the darkness. Venture into the darkest pits of Vanrakdoom and report your findings to Davril.
Vampire Reject^20^Brek the Stray^Vanrakdoom^Brek the Stray^Vanrakdoom^Origins of Evil^^Kill Vampires^You're not real. You can't be. You say you are real? Prove it! The others won't let me feed with them. It is unacceptable! I've been here since Lord Vanrak ended his own miserable existence. Why should I have to prove myself? No. No! Kill them. Kill them all!
Shadow Vigil^20^Far-Scout Davril^Vanrakdoom^Far-Scout Davril^Vanrakdoom^Origins of Evil^Purging Despair^Stop Shadowfell Rituals.^Up ahead, there is a portion of Vanrakdoom that has slipped into the Shadowfell. The Cult of Shar are performing rituals to expand its influence. How I would love to join you in the battle against darkness. But alas, my duties are to protect Portia and send word to Celeste. Among these cultists are Keresta's spawn. These vampires are not to be taken lightly as she accepts only the most cruel into her brood.
Peace of Mind^20^Far-Scout Davril^Vanrakdoom^Portia^Vanrakdoom^Origins of Evil^Purging Despair^Find out what Portia knows.^During a mission I happened upon a fallen adventurer beset by vampires. To my surprise, she still drew breath. When she awoke I tried speaking to her, but she had succumbed to despair. All I learned was her name, Portia. She could have vital information from her time spent close to the vampires. Perhaps you can make some sense of what she has to say.
Purging Despair^20^Celeste^Vanrakdoom^Far-Scout Davril^Vanrakdoom^Peace of Mind, Shadow Vigil^Waning Darkness^Remove Shadowfell by cleansing Umbraxakar's Memories.^Portia tells me the Shadowfell is Umbraxakar's despair incarnate. Kerestia is using his memories to drag Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. If the Shadowfell truly is the source of the cult's power, then we must cleanse this darkness. That amulet I gave you is blessed with the light of Selûne. Use it to purge the sorrowful memories that haunt Vanrakdoom.
Waning Darkness^20^Far-Scout Davril^Vanrakdoom^Helion Moonstar^Yawning Portal^Purging Despair^Bonnie Has a Message^Free Umbraxakar from the Shadowfell.^Celeste waits by the Halls of Worship so she may confront the shadow dragon. She cannot accomplish such a feat alone, Hero. Rise to the occasion so we may finally put an end to the darkness that lies here.
Bonnie Has a Message^20^Auto Accepted^Yawning Portal^Bonnie^Yawning Portal^Waning Darkness^Neverember's Envoy^Bonnie has a message for you^Find Bonnie at the bar. She has an urgent message for you.
Neverember's Envoy^20^Bonnie^Yawning Portal^Gayle Windwright^Yawning Portal^Bonnie Has a Message^^Meet with Neverember's Envoy^A rather fetching paladin claiming to be the envoy of Lord Neverember is waiting for you on the third floor. It's quite a gathering in fact. Don't worry, the guards have been informed and they will let you pass.
Up in the Clouds^20^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Pirri the Swift^Spinward Rise^Down to Earth^^Defeat Cult of the Howling Hatred and Allies in Spinward Rise^Aerisi still doesn't get that she crossed the wrong group. The other factions might try to think of some sort of clever option, but the Zhentarim understand when brute force is required. Go out there and take down as many of her little cutlists as you can. Aerisi will learn to fear the Zhentarim.
A Mage Summons^^Sergeant Knox^Protector's Enclave^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^^A Subtle Curiosity^Speak with Elminster Aumar in Protector's Enclave^It is good to see you again, <name>. Your presence has been requested by Elminster. He said he has a special project for you. While he might be an ally, watch yourself. He's pretty tricksy, that one.
A Subtle Curiosity^^Elminster Aumar^Protector's Enclave^Kavatos Stormeye^Protector's Enclave^A Mage Summons^Woven Disturbance^Speak to a few Neverwinter citizens and then report to Kavatos^Your timing is most fortuitous, <name>! It just so happens that I could use your assistance. Are you familiar with the Weave? It is the raw material from which the tapestry of magic itself is woven. The great Mystra, Mother of all Magic, watches over it. Whether a spell intends to heal, harness the elements, or call forth the undead, it pulls from the Weave. That brings me to my request. I've sensed someone or something tugging at the Weave, more specifically the necromantic magic it contains. While I cannot see all ends, there are others who see more than I do. Kavatos Stormeye can see many ends, and I believe he may know what is unwinding the threads of necromancy. I suggest you speak with a few citizens along the way and see if they've seen anyone suspicious. Oh, and please give Kavatos my regards.
