For this, you must travel to the village of Nighthaven in Moonglade and speak with Dendrite Starblaze of the Cenarion Circle there.

Might want to check there, <name>.The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Innkeeper Farley^Caretaker Folsom^The Legend of Stalvan^^^Retrieve Stalvan's Undelivered Letter from the chest and deliver it to the Canal District in Stormwind.^The name Stalvan rings a bell. I remember now. Many years back, on a stormy night, a messenger came in, seeking refuge for the night. Near the stroke of midnight, the man ran down the stairs screaming, his face pale with fear. Still wearing his bedclothes, he disappeared into the downpour. In his haste he forgot his letters in the chest upstairs. He never returned for them. One remains from that Stalvan fellow, intended for the Canal District in Stormwind. Help yourself to it.Report to Thomas^10^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Rolf's corpse^Guard Thomas^A Fishy Peril^^^Deliver Rolf and Malakai's Medallions to Guard Thomas at the eastern Elwynn bridge.^Now that you have both medallions, deliver them to Guard Thomas at the bridge so that he might know the fate of his murdered guards.The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Caretaker Folsom^Sealed Crate^The Legend of Stalvan^^^Search through the packed up possessions for a clue.^My father was the caretaker of the estate long before I was. He had to mop the blood up after the massacre. But that's neither here nor there. The last funds of the Flintridge trust have dried up. Now the last of the family possessions are headed for auction. Blame the tax vultures. I guess if you're really itching to learn more you're free to look through this junk. Who knows what you might find.The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Sealed Crate^Marshal Haggard^The Legend of Stalvan^^^The Torn Journal page you discovered provides your next clue.^Inside the crate you find various objects: musty heirlooms, a family portrait, a few hunting trophies and some old books. Near the bottom, underneath a ceramic vase, you uncover A Torn Journal Page.The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Marshal Haggard^Marshal Haggard^The Legend of Stalvan^^^Marshal Haggard wants you to check the chest upstairs for the Faded Journal Page.^There was a bundle of parchments in the chest upstairs when I moved into this place. I looked at them once when I first arrived but I gave up once the fog hazed over my peepers. Do an old, nearly-blind man a favor and check the chest upstairs for anything that might help you in your quest to discover more about this Stalvan character. I'm pretty sure there's a faded journal page that might be of interest to you. Bring it to me and I'll help in anyway I can.The Jasperlode Mine^10^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Marshal Dughan^Marshal Dughan^The Fargodeep Mine^^^Explore the Jasperlode Mine, then report back to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.^Thanks to you we know the Fargodeep Mine is infested with kobolds. Now we need a scout to investigate the more distant Jasperlode Mine. Explore Jasperlode and confirm any kobold presence.

I will assist you in packaging the ripple for Malton's abrasive father... for a fee of two additional bottles of said ripple. They are located in crates found in the abandoned Horde base near Skulk Rock. It will be an arduous task, to wit; foul slimes and oozes will be found sticking to the ruins; rumor has it they are led by some sort of master ooze. Regardless, procure the ripple and return to me here for packaging.The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Marshal Haggard^Tavernkeep Smitts^The Legend of Stalvan^^^Take the Faded Journal Page to Tavernkeep Smitts at Darkshire in Duskwood.^I know of someone who might be able to assist you. Back when I was leading the Stormwind Guard, we used to get drinks at the Scarlet Raven Tavern in Darkshire. The Innkeeper there, Smitts, was quite an expert on the local lore. Show him this page and see what he has to say about it.The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Tavernkeep Smitts^Commander Althea Ebonlocke^The Legend of Stalvan^^^Take the muddy page to Commander Ebonlocke.^I followed the legend of that Stalvan character for years. When those visiting nobles were slaughtered a few years back I went with Haggard to investigate. I found these muddy pages but we were never able to link the handwriting to that crazy man in the woods. Your trail of evidence proves his guilt. Take this to Commander Ebonlocke immediately and fill her in on what you've discovered!The Legend of Stalvan^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Commander Althea Ebonlocke^Clerk Daltry^The Legend of Stalvan^^^Show Clerk Daltry the Bloodstained Journal Page.^I have had my eye on that creep, Stalvan, for quite sometime. But if this page was written by the same hand it proves his guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt. In all his days keeping the Town Registry, Clerk Daltry has become an expert at identifying handwriting. Show him this page and see if the writing matches that of the registry signature.Ripple Delivery^48^All^Orgrimmar^Gilveradin Sunchaser^Dran Droffers^^A Sticky Situation^^Deliver the barrel to Dran Droffers in Orgrimmar.^I have taken the extra step of securing not only Dran's packaged ripple in the barrel, but also the extra bottles of ripple he is purloining. While I may not hold Dran very highly, there is nothing worse than jostled ripple. You're welcome. Now, deliver yon barrel to Dran Droffers in his salvage emporium in Orgrimmar. Pray tell, please extend my warmest greetings to Malton; let him know that should he ever thirst for fine drink and finer drinking companions, we would be honored with his visit.Noxious Lair Investigation^47^All^Tanaris^Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser^Alchemist Pestlezugg^Gadgetzan Water Survey^^The Scrimshank Redemption^Bring five Centipaar insect parts from the Noxious Lair to Alchemist Pestlezugg in Gadgetzan.^All right now, these reports about the bugs... what we know is that they are draining the water pools that used to be where the Noxious Lair is. What we DON'T know is, well, everything else. Let's figure out who our enemy is first! I want you to head into the Noxious Lair and get some parts off of those critters.

And you know, I think that old Bernice lady at that other farm makes great Pork Belly Pies... Maybe if you gave her some chunks of boar meat from the boars that hang around our farms, and told her what it was for, she'd bake up a pie for you.Goldtooth^8^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Billy Maclure^"Auntie" Bernice Stonefield^Lost Necklace^^^Bring Bernice's Necklace to "Auntie" Bernice Stonefield at the Stonefield Farm.^I was playing near the Fargodeep Mine, and I think I dropped, er...I mean I saw, the old lady's necklace. Don't ask me how it got there...it wasn't me! Well anyway, I saw this big, gold-toothed kobold pick up the necklace and run into the mine. Go find that kobold and you'll find the necklace, I swear!Princess Must Die!^9^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Ma Stonefield^Ma Stonefield^^^^Kill Princess, grab her collar, then bring it back to Ma Stonefield at the Stonefield Farm.^The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess.

Get her before she gets hungry and comes back here!The Everstill Bridge^20^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Foreman Oslow^Foreman Oslow^^^^Bring 5 Iron Pikes and 5 Iron Rivets to Foreman Oslow in Lakeshire.^During the last orc invasion we were forced to smelt our iron down to make bullets, swords and armor. We sent word to Stormwind for a new shipment of materials but a band of Redridge gnolls hijacked the caravan and ran off into the hills behind Lakeshire. Now we're coming up short on supplies to get this bridge rebuilt. If you can bring me 5 iron pikes and 5 iron rivets, <name>, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Now let's get to work!Seasoned Wolf Kabobs^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Chef Grual^Chef Grual^^^^Gather 10 Lean Wolf Flanks and Stormwind Seasoning Herbs and return to Chef Grual in Darkshire.^Seasoned Wolf Kabobs are a house favorite! Sure, I can make you some. But first I'll need the supplies. Bring me 10 Lean Wolf Flanks as well as some Stormwind Seasoning Herbs. There are so many wolves here in the forest, I am sure finding the Flanks will be no problem. For the herbs, seek out Felicia Gump in her canal district flower shop in Stormwind.Solomon's Law^23^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Bailiff Conacher^Bailiff Conacher^^^^Bring 10 Shadowhide Pendants to Bailiff Conacher in the Lakeshire Town Hall.^An enemy of Stormwind has taken up residence in the eastern foothills of Redridge. This wicked villain uses the Arcane to spread terror and misery upon our town and our people. Under the name, Morganth, he conducts his evil business. Morganth now controls the Shadowhide Gnoll Clan to perform his biddings. As stated by the Law of Lakeshire, aiding a criminal of the Kingdom is punishable by death. These vile gnolls must be killed! Turn in 10 Shadowhide Pendants to me, and you shall be rewarded.Redridge Goulash^18^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Chef Breanna^Chef Breanna^^^^Chef Breanna of Lakeshire wants five pieces of Tough Condor Meat, five Great Goretusk Snouts and five helpings of Crisp Spider Meat.^Nothing would please me more than to make you some Redridge Goulash.

But if you can provide me with the ingredients, I'd be happy to oblige. Just bring me five pieces of Tough Condor Meat, five Great Goretusk Snouts and five helpings of Crisp Spider Meat.Dusky Crab Cakes^20^Alliance^Duskwood^Chef Grual^Chef Grual^Jitters' Growling Gut^^^Gather 6 Gooey Spider Legs and bring them to Chef Grual in Darkshire.^I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky "Crab" Cakes are really made from spider legs! I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks! Bring me Gooey Spider Legs and I'll whip you up a few of them. I hear Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river.A Watchful Eye^21^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Theocritus^Old Lion Statue^A Watchful Eye^^^Take the Glyph of Azora to the Lion Statue near the Tower of Ilgalar in Redridge.^My rival, Morganth, is a vicious mage of great power who lives in the Tower of Ilgalar in Redridge. I have developed a means of spying on him, the Eye of Azora, and can now view him from afar. But to study his thoughts ... I require further aid. If you are willing, then take my Glyph of Azora to the Tower of Ilgalar. Place it upon the Lion Statue near the Tower. When this is done, the power of Azora will grant visions of Morganth's future plans.Sven's Revenge^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Sven Yorgen^Mound of loose dirt^Sven's Revenge^^^Go to Sven's Farm and find what was buried behind the old stump.^I used to work one of the farms to the southeast...until Dark Riders from Deadwind Pass descended upon my farm and slaughtered my family when I was away! When I returned I saw a shadowy figure skulking near my barn, burying something. He fled before I could catch him, and I couldn't linger for I was hot on the heels of the Dark Riders. So I never discovered what was hidden. If you can find what that shadowy figure buried, I would be grateful. The hiding spot is behind the old stump near my barn.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Minor Manifestation of Water^Islen Waterseer^Call of Water^^^Bring the Shard of Water to Islen Waterseer at the Tidus Stair in the Barrens.^Take shard.

I am close to completing my research on his so called remedy. My knowledge will be complete when I learn what enchantment is causing the strange behavior going on in Pyrewood Village.

They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again. The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly.

In fact, just yesterday a pack of Bone Chewers was pounding on the walls of my house! I want to make an effigy - a kind of "scarecrow" for Ghouls. To do that I need some Ghoul Ribs.

I ran, and I was forced to leave behind a crate of precious tools and herbs. After they chased me off, the ogres swaggered back to the ogre mound in southern Duskwood. I'm sure my crate is somewhere near the mound. Please, <name>, retrieve this crate for me for I miss it sorely.The Defias Brotherhood^18^Alliance^Westfall^Gryan Stoutmantle^Master Mathias Shaw^The Defias Brotherhood^^^Take Wiley's Note to Mathias Shaw in Stormwind.^I wonder what Wiley meant when he mentioned the Stonemasons. Perhaps that was a slip of tongue. Could the Defias gang be related to the Stonemasons? Only one man would know for sure: Mathias Shaw, head of SI:7. Show him Wiley's Note and see if he has anything to add to this growing mystery. If you have trouble finding Shaw, check the Barracks in Old Town.Captain Sanders' Hidden Treasure^16^All^Westfall^Captain Sanders' Treasure Map^Captain's Footlocker^Captain Sanders' Hidden Treasure^^^Find Captain Sanders' footlocker and search it for the next clue.^If ye be readin' this, it means that Ol' Captain Sanders is in a watery grave. So my treasure is yours now, ye jest need to follow the clues. First ye need to find me footlocker. It's probably half-buried in sand by now, along the Western Coast of Westfall near the shipwreck. There be lots of shipwrecks but only one rusty anchor on the coast. Find that anchor and you'll find me locker!

Swim straight west till you find the island with me treasure chest!The Defias Brotherhood^18^Alliance^Westfall^Master Mathias Shaw^Gryan Stoutmantle^The Defias Brotherhood^^^Take Shaw's report to Gryan Stoutmantle in Westfall.^The Stonemasons' Guild was run by a man named Edwin VanCleef. VanCleef was responsible for rebuilding Stormwind after the orcs razed it in the First War. Apparently, VanCleef and his men were unhappy with their treatment by the King after the reconstruction was complete. That just might explain a thing or two. I have written a more detailed account for your Master in Westfall. Take this to him at once!The Defias Brotherhood^18^Alliance^Westfall^Gryan Stoutmantle^Gryan Stoutmantle^The Defias Brotherhood^^The Defias Brotherhood^Track down the Defias Messenger in Westfall and bring his message to Stoutmantle.^We need to discover the location of the Defias hideout. <name>, my scout reports that a Defias Messenger has been seen on the roads between Moonbrook, the Gold Coast Quarry and the Jangolode Mine.

They should have been here in force by now. Time is a luxury we don't have, however. I will not stand by and watch the people of Lakeshire give their lives without trying to enlist more help. I've heard word of a people's militia forming in Westfall. Take this plea to their leader, Gryan Stoutmantle. Perhaps Stoutmantle's men can lend some support here until the King sends reserves.Messenger to Westfall^14^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Gryan Stoutmantle^Magistrate Solomon^Messenger to Westfall^^Messenger to Darkshire^Return to Magistrate Solomon with Gryan Stoutmantle's response.^Magistrate Solomon's note pains me to read. But it is obvious he knows not the war which is waged in Westfall or else he would know better than to expect aid from the Militia. If Stormwind had not deserted us as well, we would not have the need for the Militia. Take this response to your master in Redridge, <class>. And let him know that my heart is heavy with the loss of good men.Messenger to Darkshire^18^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Magistrate Solomon^Lord Ello Ebonlocke^Messenger to Darkshire^Messenger to Westfall^^Magistrate Solomon wants you to take a letter to Lord Ebonlocke in Darkshire.^I require your assistance once again.

Do not stray from the roads.Messenger to Darkshire^18^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Lord Ello Ebonlocke^Magistrate Solomon^Messenger to Darkshire^^^Return to Magistrate Solomon with Lord Ebonlocke's letter of response.^If I did not know Magistrate Solomon personally, I would say the man has gone mad. Send the Night Watch to Lakeshire because Stormwind refuses aid? The Night Watch was formed because Stormwind left us when this foul magic seeped into the land. If I sent my Night Watch, this town would be overrun by evil before the guards even reached the forest's edge. Take this letter of response to your Master in Lakeshire.Manhunt^10^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Marshal Dughan^Marshal Dughan^^The Collector^^Find and kill "the Collector" then return to Marshal Dughan with The Collector's Ring.^If the "Collector" is taking gold from our mines then he's stealing from the kingdom!

Such a tired beast after all the work we put her through. I fed her before we left the farm, but we weren't expecting the wagon to break on us. If you could bring her a few handfuls of oats from the fields, I'd be grateful. I bet you could find some around all of the farms in Westfall, if you can steer clear of those horrific machines that have taken over. There are several farms southwest of here.The Coast Isn't Clear^19^All^Westfall^Captain Grayson^Captain Grayson^^^^Kill 7 Tidehunters, 7 Warriors, 7 Oracles and 7 Coastrunners and return to Captain Grayson at the Westfall Lighthouse.^You probably noticed all of the shipwrecks along the coast.

Rot blossoms grow in strange places. In particular, I hear you can find them inside the skulls of Skeletal Horrors and Skeletal Fiends... not that I've gotten close enough to look! The Raven Hill Cemetery is lousy with those skeletons. You may as well get rid of them while you're looking for rot blossoms. The town of Darkshire would be grateful.Deliver the Thread^24^Alliance^Duskwood^Madame Eva^Abercrombie^Supplies from Darkshire^^^Bring the Ghost Hair Thread to Abercrombie, in his shack north of the Raven Hill Cemetery.^Here is your thread, <name>. It has a thousand uses, from binding evil spirits to sewing life into inanimate objects.Zombie Juice^24^Alliance^Duskwood^Abercrombie^Tavernkeep Smitts^Supplies from Darkshire^^^Speak with Tavernkeep Smitts.^I need a bottle of a certain liquor - Zombie Juice. Tavernkeep Smitts at the Scarlet Raven Tavern in Darkshire should have some. And please hurry, <name>.

This must be analyzed by an explosives expert so we know just what we're dealing with here. Ashlan Stonesmirk was assigned to the regiment guarding Dun Modr and the Thandol Span. I need you to make a grave and perilous journey, <name>. Travel through the Algaz Gate, follow the road through the Wetlands and seek out Stonesmirk in Dun Modr. Heed my advice: stick to the roads and stop for nothing!Rise of the Silithid^49^Alliance^Tanaris^Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser^Gracina Spiritmight^^Insect Part Analysis^^Take the Insect Analysis Report to Gracina Spiritmight in Darnassus.^I urge you to take this report to someone who has working knowledge in this kind of thing. I know this night elf scholar named Gracina Spiritmight. She's spent a lot of time studying life forms that are unique to the ecology of Azeroth; she's a historian to boot! If you want someone to help figure out what exactly this threat is, and more importantly how to stop it, give her the report. We'll need the help. Last I heard, she was residing in the Temple of the Moon, located in Darnassus.Raven Hill^20^Alliance^Duskwood^Elaine Carevin^Jitters^^^Jitters' Growling Gut^Find out what is haunting Raven Hill.^Something's amiss at Raven Hill, <name>.

No clue where these stinkin' thieving types came from. Anyway, the mine tunnel collapsed on us. I got out but the others... well... the others haven't been heard from. You look like you might have better luck in there. If you could look for my brother, I'd be thankful. He always carried his Explorers' League Badge. If you can't find him, that badge would at least give me some peace of mind.Collecting Memories^18^Alliance^The Deadmines^Wilder Thistlenettle^Wilder Thistlenettle^^^^Retrieve 4 Miners' Union Cards and return them to Wilder Thistlenettle in Stormwind.^Many of my friends perished that horrible day when the mine tunnel caved in.

After the last trogg attack, we could use all the help we can get. I hear the buggers have been popping up all across the lands, and it seems Coldridge Valley is no exception. They've been spotted all over the hills to the southeast and near the frozen lake. And that's not all, just a few nights ago, they attacked and overran our camp to the west! We're a bit shorthanded here, <lad /lass>, and we need strong arms to help drive the troggs back.Worgen in the Woods^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Calor^Calor^Worgen in the Woods^^^Kill 6 Nightbane Shadow Weaver worgen for Calor in Darkshire.^Darkness seems drawn inexorably to Duskwood.

The Senate has its hands full with the troggs, so they've no need for further annoyances. From what I've seen, the trolls aren't well situated here in Coldridge Valley--mostly the southern cave. I'd say that the army will not be necessary. A few strong arms should be more than enough. Perhaps you'd like to assist in this endeavor? I have the authority to offer compensation for your help.The Boar Hunter^3^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Talin Keeneye^Talin Keeneye^^^^Talin Keeneye would like you to kill 8 Small Crag Boars.^Nothing like a day of boar hunting, eh? Though, here in Coldridge Valley, there are so many boars it almost takes the fun out of it. No need to get them charging. They're all angry and ready without any help. In fact, recently, there've been so many boars in the area, it's become dangerous for me to do my daily hunting.

They haven't been delivered, and with the trolls attacking, I'll need someone to do it. Doren's camp lies northwest of the road at the entrance to Stranglethorn from Duskwood. Give the supplies to Private Thorsen, if he's not in the camp, then he'll be patrolling south of it. He'll take care of them. Mind you, if you fail, you'll owe me restitution.A Dark Threat Looms^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Suspicious Barrel^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^A Dark Threat Looms^^^Return to Chief Engineer Hinderweir and show him the clue that you discovered.^You take a sample of the strange smelling powder.Bookie Herod^35^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Lieutenant Doren^Bookie Herod's Records^Jungle Secrets^^^Find Bookie Herod's Records.^If Kurzen knows Thorsen's secret, then we have a spy in our midst. We must determine how the secret was leaked! Thorsen's contact within Kurzen's camp was Bookie Herod. Herod is Kurzen's logistics officer and knows everything about the running of Kurzen's Compound. If you can get Herod's notes or records, maybe we can find out how Thorsen was discovered. When we were still with Kurzen, Bookie's office was on the top floor of the camp's only two-story house. His records are probably still there.Investigate the Camp^32^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Krazek^Krazek^^^^Find the hunters' camp and report its location to Krazek in Booty Bay.^I've gotten reports of a group of hunters that have set up camp upriver of the Venture Company mining camp on Lake Nazferiti. Now, normally I wouldn't care, but improbably, I heard that Hemet Nesingwary Jr. was one of the hunters there. He's certainly well-connected, if you catch my meaning, and you never can be too safe. Why don't you go check out the camp, <name>, see what they're about?Colonel Kurzen^40^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Lieutenant Doren^Lieutenant Doren^Special Forces^^Kurzen's Mystery^Kill 6 Kurzen Elite, 4 Kurzen Subchiefs, and bring Kurzen's Head to Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp.^You have proven yourself time and again, and your resourcefulness seems to rival even that of Kurzen himself. You may be the salvation of our band of rebels...if you can pit yourself against Kurzen and prevail! He commands his men from deep within the Stockpile. You must enter that cave, brave through his defenders, and face Kurzen and his leaders. Farewell, <name>. My hope, and the fate of my men, go with you.The Second Rebellion^33^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Sergeant Yohwa^Sergeant Yohwa^^^Special Forces^Kill 15 Kurzen Jungle Fighters.^We're fighting a losing battle with Colonel Kurzen. Not only is he a brilliant tactician, he outnumbers us at least 10 to 1! To survive, we need to use his own, covert tactics against him. Enter his camp to the east and kill his men. Lots of them. And get out before reinforcements can close on you.Bad Medicine^34^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Sergeant Yohwa^Sergeant Yohwa^^^Special Forces^Bring 7 Jungle Remedies and 1 Venom Fern Extract to Sergeant Yohwa at the Rebel Camp.^To have a chance against Kurzen, we need his healing support neutralized. He has gathered a large number of medicine men who heal his forces with jungle remedies and poison our fighters with venom fern extracts. We need those remedies and extracts for our own. Search the Kurzen Compound - his medicine men and jungle fighters will have the remedies, and the extracts are probably stowed in some of the camp's supply boxes.Troll Witchery^40^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Brother Nimetz^Brother Nimetz^Kurzen's Mystery^^Mai'Zoth^Bring 4 Skullsplitter Fetishes to Brother Nimetz at the Rebel Camp.^While I study those legends you acquired, gather for me implements of evil troll magic. Enter the territory of the Skullsplitter trolls, a second tribe to the distant south, and acquire Skullsplitter Fetishes from their Witchdoctors and Mystics.Mai'Zoth^46^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Brother Nimetz^Brother Nimetz^^Troll Witchery^^Bring the Mind's Eye to Brother Nimetz at the Rebel Camp.^Kurzen may be dead, but...that which drove him to evil still lives! Through my studies I have discovered this: An Ogre Mage - Mai'Zoth - dwells in an Ogre Mound within the eastern mountains of Stranglethorn. He is rumored to employ mind-controlling magic, and I am positive that he corrupted Kurzen. If Mai'Zoth is allowed to live, then his evil may influence others, and may even cause another Kurzen to surface. Kill him, and bring me his Mind's Eye, the artifact he uses to corrupt others.Kurzen's Mystery^38^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Brother Nimetz^Brother Nimetz^Kurzen's Mystery^Colonel Kurzen^^Find the 4 tablets and bring their legends back to Brother Nimetz.^Colonel Kurzen was once a great, noble man - I must find what caused his fall into depravity! He may be under the sway of troll magic. To confirm this, I must study some of their legends. There are 4 tablets hidden within the troll ruins of Stranglethorn. I must see what is written on these tablets! Transcribe their markings and bring the transcriptions back to me. The first tablet is in the Bal'lal Ruins, the second is in the Vile Reef, and the third and fourth are in the Ruins of Zul'Kunda.Big Game Hunter^43^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^^Tiger Mastery, Panther Mastery, Raptor Mastery^^Hemet Nesingwary Jr. wants you to bring him the head of King Bangalash, the great white tiger.^<name>, you are a hunter worthy of our company. From the battlefields of Lordaeron to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated. You have killed the ferocious Sin'Dall, the elusive Bag'thera and the treacherous Tethis. But the true prize is the head of King Bangalash. That white tiger is the reason I am here. I've had my sights on him for quite some time now. Kill King Bangalash and your hunting prowess is proven to be second to none.Skullsplitter Tusks^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Kebok^Kebok^^Bloodscalp Ears^^Acquire 18 Skullsplitter Tusks and return them to Kebok.^It's expensive and hard to kill enough tigers to support the export of tiger fangs to the islands in the South Seas. Luckily, we've developed a technique that allows us to take mundane horn-like objects and turn them into undetectable forgeries. The closest match we've found, amazingly, are the tusks of the Skullsplitter trolls. Hey, before you say anything, what the buyer doesn't know doesn't hurt them, am I right? Bring me a large number of them so we can get to work on the monthly shipment!Krazek's Cookery^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Corporal Kaleb^Krazek^Krazek's Cookery^^^Bring Krazek's Crock Pot to Krazek the goblin.^I do most of the cooking at the camp. And it used to be a lot of work, until I bought a mechanical cooking pot from a goblin merchant in Booty Bay. The pot is a wonder! It saved me countless hours...until it broke! Can you take the pot back to the goblin for me so he can fix it? His name is Krazek.Alas, Andorhal^60^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^^All Along the Watchtowers^^Bring Araj's Phylactery Shard to Commander Ashlam Valorfist at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^Alas, the time to attack Andorhal and drive out the lich that controls it is upon us! Inside the ruins of the city is where the lich - Araj the Summoner - holds dominion. He is guarded by numerous Scourge surrounding the remains of city's center, and his personal retinue of guardians attached to him directly is formidable. You will need numerous allies to even stand a chance of facing him successfully. Destroy Araj, <name>, and bring me a shard from his phylactery as proof!A Meal Served Cold^40^Alliance^Stormwind City^Angus Stern^Angus Stern^^^^Kill a Cold Eye Basilisk, get a Chilled Basilisk Haunch, and return it to Angus Stern in the Blue Recluse.^One of my most famous dishes is Chilled Basilisk in Lime Vinaigrette. But the problem is... the meat is impossible to keep fresh, and I must serve the dish tonight for a noble's birthday! So if you can bring me a Chilled Basilisk Haunch from a freshly-killed Cold Eye Basilisk, quickly, then I will owe you a king's feast! Cold Eye Basilisks are known to roam along the beach dunes of northwestern Stranglethorn, so you have much traveling to do. And be swift!Hostile Takeover^36^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Kebok^Kebok^^^^Retrieve 8 Tumbled Crystals and return them to Kebok in Booty Bay.^He's done it this time! Bad enough that Gelriz's muscling out the moguls who were appointed by the trade princes, now he tries to cut in on the most notorious pirate! Revilgaz won't have it, and he's told me to take care of the problem in my own way. My way? Theft. The Venture Co. geologists near Lake Nazferiti are deeply interested in those strange blue crystals they have been finding in the mines. Bring me samples of the stone from their geologists, I don't care what you have to do to get them.Red Silk Bandanas^17^Alliance^The Deadmines^Scout Riell^Scout Riell^^The Defias Brotherhood^^Scout Riell at the Sentinel Hill Tower wants you to bring her 10 Red Silk Bandanas.^It's no secret that the trademark of the Defias Gang is their Red Bandanas. But we've learned that the material from which these bandanas are made signifies the member's rank. That being said, I want you to eliminate as many high ranking Defias members as you can. The highest ranking members will undoubtedly be found in VanCleef's secret hideout. When you're done bring me 10 Red Silk Bandanas as proof of their deaths and I will reward you. Good luck, <name>.Jungle Secrets^33^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Private Thorsen^Lieutenant Doren^Jungle Secrets^^^Speak with Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp.^Thank you for saving me, <name>. I know how this looks, but...allow me to explain. I was charged by Lieutenant Doren to re-enlist with Kurzen's men, so that I might spy on them and bring sorely needed intelligence to the rebels. You saw here what I had thought would be my chance to infiltrate Kurzen's Compound. I was wrong, and again, thanks for saving me. This was a top secret mission, so you must tell no one. But if you speak with Doren he will explain.Between a Rock and a Thistlefur^24^Horde^Ashenvale^Karang Amakkar^Karang Amakkar^^^King of the Foulweald^Take down 8 Thistlefur Avengers and 8 Thistlefur Shaman; most are located east of Zoram Strand in Thistlefur Village. Once completed, return to Karang Amakkar at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale.^The Thistlefur furbolgs are threatening our expansion! Thistlefur Village to our east blocks the way between us here and the Splintertree Post. It's a path that would circumvent the village of Astranaar; without it, we give the Alliance an extra expansion path. <name>, we must not allow... an expansion path gap! Proceed to Thistlefur Village and thin out the furbolgs. You will be given compensation for this task, but more importantly you will be doing your duty for the Horde!In Defense of the King's Lands^17^Alliance^Loch Modan^Captain Rugelfuss^Captain Rugelfuss^^In Defense of the King's Lands^^Kill the Trogg leader, Grawmug, and his two guards, Gnasher and Brawler then report back to Captain Rugelfuss in the southern guard tower.^<name>, our scouts have identified the leader of this recent Trogg incursion. It appears that these beasts in Loch Modan are following the lead of a chieftain named Grawmug. Grawmug is heavily guarded, however. Two of his most elite guards, Gnasher and Brawler, never leave his side. If you feel yourself worthy, <name>, I want you to lead the assassination mission on Grawmug and his two thugs. With the Trogg leadership dead, we just might stand a chance at pushing these beasts back into the ground.The Stolen Journal^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Grelin Whitebeard^Grelin Whitebeard^The Troll Cave^^^Grelin Whitebeard wants you to kill Grik'nir the Cold, and retrieve his journal.^My journal! They took it away to the cave. The one that had it... It was a big brute with some odd markings on his skin and face. I didn't get a much better look than that. You've had some luck with the trolls, maybe you could go get it back for me?Missing In Action^25^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Corporal Keeshan^Marshal Marris^^^^Protect Corporal Keeshan on the journey back to Redridge.^At last, friends of the Alliance! Help... please... The last thing I remember these foul Orcs overpowered our regiment. Most the men were killed. I took a strong blow to the head and everything went black. Now I am held captive in this cave. Help me, I am hurt badly. I'll need help getting back to town... please... you're my last hope...Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Brine^Islen Waterseer^Call of Water^^Call of Water, Water Sapta^Bring the Vial of Purest Water to Islen Waterseer at the Tidus Stair in the Barrens.^Islen will have one more task for you before rewarding you with your next totem. The vial of water I've given you is necessary for whatever that task is. Go now and find her. We shall meet again some day.Worgen in the Woods^29^Alliance^Duskwood^Calor^Calor^Worgen in the Woods^^^Kill 12 Nightbane Dark Runner worgen for Calor in Darkshire.^You might have noticed some larger worgen wandering around with the Shadow Weavers in the woods? From what we can tell, these Dark Runners make up the bulk of the worgen numbers. On my rangings, I've also noticed that they have overrun the Rotting Orchard southwest of town. These worgen are a bit tougher than the last you faced. Be on your guard.Worgen in the Woods^31^Alliance^Duskwood^Calor^Calor^Worgen in the Woods^^^Kill 8 Nightbane Vile Fang and 8 Nightbane Tainted One worgen for Calor in Darkshire.^Your previous accomplishments have convinced me that you are ready to take on the toughest worgen infesting the woods. Of the worgen that have made their new home here, the Vile Fangs and the Tainted Ones have proven the most dangerous. They've settled down near some of the caves and in the mine to the south. From far away you can even see the light from their bonfires...Worgen in the Woods^31^All^Duskwood^Calor^Jonathan Carevin^Worgen in the Woods^^^Bring Calor's note to Jonathan Carevin.^Here you go, <name>. Bring this message to Master Carevin. <He quickly removes a piece of faded parchment and offers it to you.> A few more like you, and we will outnumber the Night Watch! Perhaps then we could complete the work that we few carry on today.In Defense of the King's Lands^12^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Cobbleflint^Mountaineer Cobbleflint^^^In Defense of the King's Lands^Mountaineer Cobbleflint of the southern guard tower wants you to kill 10 Stonesplinter Troggs and 10 Stonesplinter Scouts.^We need to protect the Loch, <name>! With so many of the King's soldiers fighting valiantly on remote battlefields, we've become overwhelmed on the home front. Troggs are tunneling up from every crevice! The Trogg infestation poses the largest threat to Ironforge. These disgusting mutants must be destroyed. We need you, brave adventurer, to venture forth and lay waste to the Trogg threat. Slay 10 Stonesplinter Troggs and 10 Stonesplinter Scouts and report back.The Weathered Grave^30^Alliance^Duskwood^A Weathered Grave^Sirra Von'Indi^The Weathered Grave^^^Speak with Sirra Von'Indi in Darkshire.^The weathered grave marker reads simply: MORGAN LADIMORE <Upon further examination, you notice that dirt over the grave has been recently disturbed, and that a good amount of the dirt seems to have been displaced...>Wolves at Our Heels^21^Alliance^Duskwood^Lars^Lars^^^^Kill 12 Starving Dire Wolves and 8 Rabid Dire Wolves, then return to Lars at Sven's Camp on the western border of Duskwood.^Sven and I have dangerous days ahead of us, what with the Necromancer to the east and all. And out here alone as we are, we have to hunt for our own food. It seems every time I'm heading back to camp with some meat on me, starving or rabid dire wolves come out of the forest wanting a bite. It goes without saying, living out here is dangerous work! But if you can rid us of some of those wolves, we'd have an easier time of it. They mostly prowl north and east of here, near the river.Morgan Ladimore^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Sirra Von'Indi^Commander Althea Ebonlocke^The Weathered Grave^^^Speak with Commander Althea Ebonlocke in Darkshire.^<He searches through the shelves and comes up with a leatherbound book.> If you would like to know more, you might ask Althea, she's been the one to handle the... trouble... with him of late.Mor'Ladim^30^All^Duskwood^Commander Althea Ebonlocke^Commander Althea Ebonlocke^The Weathered Grave^^^Kill Mor'Ladim, then return his skull to Commander Althea Ebonlocke in Darkshire.^From what my scouts tell me, Mor'Ladim wanders throughout Duskwood, following a strange and meandering path through the cemetery. We buried him out past the house on the hill, you know where that is? There isn't anything I can do to help you, but I wish you good luck.The Daughter Who Lived^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Commander Althea Ebonlocke^Watcher Ladimore^The Weathered Grave^^^Speak with Watcher Sarah Ladimore in Darkshire.^I should have told you this earlier... How do I put this... Morgan may have believed that his family was all dead, but, in fact, his daughter Sarah Ladimore is now a Watcher. She's always been troubled by the... circumstances... surrounding her father's death. Perhaps you could go to bring the news to her.Sven's Camp^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Mound of loose dirt^Sven Yorgen^Sven's Revenge^^^Bring the Book from Sven's Farm to Sven.^Digging through the mound, you find a small, dirt-stained book. The book has no title, but...it has information Sven would like to know.A Daughter's Love^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Watcher Ladimore^A Weathered Grave^The Weathered Grave^^^Take Sarah Ladimore's ring to Morgan Ladimore's grave.^Here, take this and lay it on his grave. Maybe... somehow, he'll know that I'm okay, and that none of us hold him responsible for what happened. <There are tears in her eyes now, as she slides a ring from her right hand, and presses it into your hands.> And... thank you, <name>.Errand for Apothecary Zinge^45^Horde^Undercity^Apothecary Zinge^Alessandro Luca^Errand for Apothecary Zinge^^^Take the purchase order to Alessandro Luca in the Undercity.^The Royal Apothecary Society needs your assistance. Listen closely, and both of us may profit from my plan. Apothecary Keever in the next room may be... touched... but his research does potentially bear fruit if it were pursued by a clever researcher. Fortunately, I am such a researcher. I want you to take this purchase order to Alessandro Luca, the proprietor of Blue Moon Odds and Ends; he'll give you a testing kit. When you have it, bring it back to me and I'll outline your task in detail.Coldridge Valley Mail Delivery^3^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Sten Stoutarm^Talin Keeneye^^Dwarven Outfitters^Coldridge Valley Mail Delivery^Deliver the stack of letters to Talin Keeneye in Coldridge Valley.^Hm, I don't suppose you'd be willing to do a favor for me, <lad /lass>? A stack of letters came through the pass today, but I don't have the time to send them along. They're all addressed to Talin Keeneye. You can find him to the west down the road. He's set up camp next to the frozen lake. What do you say?Coldridge Valley Mail Delivery^4^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Talin Keeneye^Grelin Whitebeard^^Coldridge Valley Mail Delivery^^Deliver the letter to Grelin Whitebeard in Coldridge Valley.^If I remember correctly, Grelin's camp is down the road to the southeast. No doubt he'll be eager to get his mail.The Ashenvale Hunt^20^Horde^Orgrimmar^Warcaller Gorlach^Senani Thunderheart^^^^Speak with Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.^Attention, young adventurers! The wilds of Ashenvale await you! The Horde has established a strong presence in the lands north of the Barrens. Our two outposts - Splintertree Post and the Zoram Strand Outpost - strive to bring glory to the Horde! Those who would prove themselves should seek out guidance there. Of note: Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post, directly north of the Barrens, seeks adventurers willing to take part in a great hunt of Ashenvale!Fueling the Demolishers^80^All^Wintergrasp^Siege Master Stouthandle^Commander Zanneth^^^^Siege Master Stouthandle at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Eternal Embers from Horde players at the Cauldron of Flames.^<name>! About time you showed up. While the battle may be over, we still need to prepare for the next battle. Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in south eastern Wintergrasp and retrieve several eternal embers. The embers are mixed in with coal to fuel the Demolisher and Siege Engines. Oh, and if you happen to see some of the Horde in the Cauldron, don't hesitate to slay them and take their embers. We can't let them have the advantage in the next battle.In Defense of the King's Lands^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Gravelgaw^Mountaineer Gravelgaw^^In Defense of the King's Lands^In Defense of the King's Lands^Mountaineer Gravelgaw in the southern guard tower wants you to kill 10 Stonesplinter Skullthumpers and 10 Stonesplinter Seers and report back to him.^Mountaineer Cobbleflint had nothing but good things to say about you, <race>. For that reason I am going to entrust upon you a mission of utmost importance. We need to keep pressure on the invading Trogg forces until our Dwarven brethren return from the Alliance front. Set forth into the southern hills and kill 10 Stonesplinter Skullthumpers and 10 Stonesplinter Seers. Your attacks will buy us some time. Report back when your mission is complete.Errand for Apothecary Zinge^45^Horde^Undercity^Alessandro Luca^Apothecary Zinge^Errand for Apothecary Zinge^^^Bring the Field Sampling Kit to Apothecary Zinge in the Undercity.^The kit is ready, <name>. No doubt that Apothecary Zinge will want this as soon as possible. Take it to her without delay, and let her know that I will add the cost of the kit to the Society's tab. Also, please extend to her my warmest salutations. Well, don't just stand there. Such is the life of a simple courier, yes?Westbrook Garrison Needs Help!^10^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Marshal Dughan^Deputy Rainer^Westbrook Garrison Needs Help!^^^Go to the Westbrook Garrison and speak with Deputy Rainer.^The Garrison on our western border sends word of increasing gnoll and thief activity. They're requesting we send more Stormwind soldiers... but we just don't have any to spare! If you can help, we could use it. Go and speak with Deputy Rainer at the Westbrook Garrison and see what he needs done. The Garrison is down the road to the west. After you cross the bridge over the small brook it will be to the right.Return to Jitters^20^Alliance^Duskwood^Chef Grual^Jitters^Jitters' Growling Gut^^^Return to Jitters with the Dusky Crab Cakes.^And here we are - "Crab" Cakes ala Grual!Into the Field^46^Horde^Tanaris^Apothecary Zinge^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Errand for Apothecary Zinge^^^Speak to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle in Gadgetzan about getting a power source for the testing kit.^You will be headed to the Tanaris desert, testing the tissue consistency of the basilisks, scorpids, and hyena native there. Obtain tissue samples and use them with the testing kit in tow; expect a chunk of the samples to fail. I need eight acceptable samples of each creature type. In addition, the goblins of Gadgetzan have a power source that must be used with this kind of modified kit. Speak to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle and acquire one for the kit. Return to me only when you are successful.Encroaching Gnolls^16^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Guard Parker^Deputy Feldon^Encroaching Gnolls^^^Report to Deputy Feldon at the bridge south of Lakeshire in Redridge Mountains.^Hail, <class>. I am charged to patrol this stretch of road. Although the road is safe for now, I've seen gnoll encampments to the north and east of here. Lakeshire must know of the gathering gnoll force! Report to Deputy Feldon in Lakeshire and tell him of the gnolls. Do this, and I'm sure Feldon will offer you a scout's wage. Feldon's usually inspecting the area south of the bridge to Lakeshire.Eight-Legged Menaces^21^Alliance^Duskwood^Watcher Dodds^Watcher Dodds^^^^Kill 15 Pygmy Venom Web Spiders, and then report back to Watcher Dodds in Duskwood.^Hail, <class>. Perhaps you've seen those spiders that have taken over the western border? The eight-legged menaces are too much for us to handle, and the Commander hasn't enough manpower to spare so far from Darkshire. I hate to ask this of you, but you seem like you might be able to handle them. I can't promise you anything of great value, but I can reward you if you can help root out the filthy bugs. Oh, and a word of advice, you'll want to avoid their venom if you can.Assessing the Threat^17^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Deputy Feldon^Deputy Feldon^Encroaching Gnolls^^^Kill 10 Redridge Mongrels and 6 Redridge Poachers, then report back to Deputy Feldon in Lakeshire.^We don't have men to spare, but something must be done about those gnolls you reported to me. Scout southern Redridge for gnolls. Harry them, kill those you can and report back to me with a count of their numbers and an assessment of the threat they present. You may find those gnolls camped all along the southern road of Redridge. Do this for the Stormwind Army, <name>, and you will be rewarded.Looking Further^22^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Old Lion Statue^An Empty Jar^A Watchful Eye^^Morganth^Climb the intact watch tower beside Stonewatch Keep in Redridge Mountains.^I have been watching the Tower of Ilgalar, and can detect that Morganth is in conflict with the Orcs in Stonewatch Keep. I do not know the reason behind their contention, but you may aid me in unraveling this mystery. Take another Glyph of Azora, then go to the top of the intact watch tower beside Stonewatch Keep. Find a suitable object on which to place the Glyph. A chest or a jar -- some place where the glyph will not be noticed -- will suit my purpose.Morganth^26^Alliance^Redridge Mountains^Theocritus^Theocritus^^Looking Further^^Defeat Morganth.^After much observation, I have discovered Morganth's plans. He searches for the Scythe of Elune...and he may have found it! If he has, then the Redridge Mountains, and the kingdom of Stormwind, will soon feel his dark might. I am not prepared to pit myself against Morganth, but I fear he must be dealt with now. So you must enter the Tower of Ilgalar and face Morganth. Defeat him, and bring me his Pendant of Shadow. Do this, and the kingdom will owe you much.A Dark Threat Looms^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^Suspicious Barrel^A Dark Threat Looms^^^Investigate the area near the eastern ramp of the Dam and bring Chief Engineer Hinderweir a clue that might reveal what the Dark Iron Dwarves are up to.^Thank the stars someone is concerned about the well-being of the Dam. First the destruction of the Thandol Span and then the pillaging of Dun Modr! I have no doubt that the Dam will be the target of the next Dark Iron threat. Most of the security detail here was reassigned to the Alliance Front, including my top inspector. That's why I need you, <name>. I spotted some Dark Iron Sappers milling about the eastern ramp of the Dam. Investigate the area and bring back a clue.Translate Abercrombie's Note^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Lord Ello Ebonlocke^Sirra Von'Indi^Supplies from Darkshire^^Wait for Sirra to Finish^Bring the Letter to Ello to Sirra Von'Indi.^Take the note you gave me to Sirra Von'Indi. He's very learned in languages and ancient arts - if anyone here can translate this message, it's he.Translation to Ello^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Sirra Von'Indi^Lord Ello Ebonlocke^Wait for Sirra to Finish^^Bride of the Embalmer^Bring the Translated Letter to Lord Ello Ebonlocke^Oh my! If what is written on this note is true, then Abercrombie's done something...unspeakable. You better bring the translated note back to Ello. And do so quickly, for I fear a doom already lumbers toward our town...Bride of the Embalmer^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Lord Ello Ebonlocke^Lord Ello Ebonlocke^^Translation to Ello^^Find Eliza's grave. Retrieve the Embalmer's Heart from her, then return to Ello Ebonlocke.^The Embalmer is a name told in one of our children's stories. He was a kindly alchemist, driven mad by the death of his wife, Eliza. To restore her, he used dark magic to place his own heart within the bosom of his dead spouse. This revived Eliza...but it cursed her with a hunger for human flesh, forcing the Embalmer to keep her buried. His heart is his power. Find his wife's grave, retrieve his heart, and bring it to me while it still beats. Do this and his power will be broken.Mercenaries^19^Alliance^Loch Modan^Magistrate Bluntnose^Magistrate Bluntnose^^^^Magistrate Bluntnose of Thelsamar has hired you to kill 4 Mo'grosh Ogres, 4 Mo'grosh Brutes and 4 Mo'grosh Enforcers.^Two months just to hear from Ironforge that we'll be spared a handful of soldiers for our own defense, and another two months until they arrive! Bad enough that our town goes unprotected, but the excavation and the dam--the dam!--are open to attacks as well. I've no choice then, it seems. I'll need hired arms. How about you? You seem a likely sort, <class>. A group of ogres has set up camp on the northeast of the lake. Perhaps you will be the one to remove the threat to our town?WANTED: Chok'sul^22^Alliance^Loch Modan^WANTED^Magistrate Bluntnose^^^^Kill Chok'sul and bring his head to Magistrate Bluntnose of Thelsamar.^By order of the Magistrate of Thelsamar: Chok'sul, the ogre presumed to be the leader and coordinator of attacks against the town of Thelsamar, Stonewrought Dam, and the excavation site, is wanted dead through any means necessary. Monetary compensation will be provided when proof is brought to the Magistrate of Chok'sul's death. Chok'sul was last seen at the ogre encampment in the northeastern part of Loch Modan.A Hunter's Boast^16^Alliance^Loch Modan^Daryl the Youngling^Daryl the Youngling^A Hunter's Boast^^^Kill 6 Mountain Buzzards and return to Daryl the Youngling in the Farstrider Lodge within 15 minutes.^Think you can match wits with Daryl the Bold, huh? I should think not! Of course, you're more than welcome to try. Here's a challenge that should prove to be above your abilities, so don't feel too bad if you can't face up to it. A flock of buzzards has nested here in Loch Modan. Why don't you try to take down some of the beasts? Tell you what, if you meet my challenge in fifteen minutes, I'll give you my bow or gun. <He looks you over dismissively.> It seems you haven't much to lose, anyways.A Hunter's Challenge^17^Alliance^Loch Modan^Daryl the Youngling^Daryl the Youngling^A Hunter's Boast^^Vyrin's Revenge^Kill 5 Elder Mountain Boars and return to Daryl the Youngling in the Farstrider Lodge within 12 minutes.^<name>ath, is it? I can tell you're bursting with pride over completing the first test, hm? As I told you before, it's no large feat. You should try your hand at boar hunting. Trust me, this is no Coldridge Valley boar hunt, so you'd best have a care with them. I'll give you just twelve minutes this time. Don't feel bad if you fail. I'd give you the shirt off my back if you succeeded! Have I ever related to you the story of how I received my famous scar? No? It was two years ago...Down the Scarlet Path^39^Alliance^Desolace^Brother Anton^Brother Anton^Brother Anton^^^Destroy 30 Undead Ravagers, then return to Brother Anton at Nijel's Point.^I will be frank. We are at war with the Scourge. It is an evil that corrupts our people and infects our land. It must be stopped before it overwhelms us and drags our world into shadow. We of the Scarlet Crusade have sworn to fight the Scourge with body and soul. If you are with us, then gather your courage and prove your allegiance--destroy the undead ravagers of Desolace, in the Valley of Bones to the south. Do this, and the Crusade will embrace you.The Shadowy Figure^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Sven Yorgen^Madame Eva^Sven's Revenge^^^Take the book you found at Sven's farm and show it to townsfolk in Darkshire.^I must know who was that skulker in the shadows I saw the night my family was killed! Please, <name>, you have shown your resourcefulness. Please find that shadowy figure. I must learn what secrets he holds! I do not have clues that you do not already know, but here - take the book you found at my farm. Perhaps some of the townsfolk can link this book with its owner.In Defense of the King's Lands^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Wallbang^Mountaineer Wallbang^^In Defense of the King's Lands^In Defense of the King's Lands^Mountaineer Wallbang in the southern guard tower wants you to kill 10 Stonesplinter Shaman and 10 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers.^The Mountaineers tell me you are quite brave and capable, <name>. We need a <race> like you around here. The Trogg problem isn't getting any better. The reserves have been called to the front and we're all alone out here. But now that we have a seasoned <class> here, let's see what you can do. Go out and kill 10 Stonesplinter Shaman and 10 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers. Let's see if you live up to your reputation, Trogg-Slayer.Until Death Do Us Part^15^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Clarice Foster^Yuriv's Tombstone^^^^Place Clarice's Pendant on Yuriv's Tomb in Silverpine.^Filthy scum! Leaves me for his damn crusade. Because "the Light is the most important thing we have against the threats the undead pose." Well, what about his children?! What about ME?! Night after night I sat patiently waiting for him... always second to his blasted duty! Well, witness what "justice" brings you, <name>! He's dead and I'm bearing the very thing he was trying to stop! Take this piece of junk and put it on his tomb at the Sepulcher. I want nothing to do with it anymore... or him!The Shadowy Search Continues^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Madame Eva^Clerk Daltry^Sven's Revenge^^^See if other townsfolk have clues about the shadowy figure.^Here is your book back, <name>, and I bid you fortune with your search. If you ask others in town, perhaps they can offer you more clues. And here is one more for you - although the author of this book is a stranger to Darkshire, the book itself was purchased here.Inquire at the Inn^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Clerk Daltry^Tavernkeep Smitts^Sven's Revenge^^^Search the inn for clues about the shadowy figure.^Here is your book, and good luck with your inquiries. You might want to expand your search to the inn. If the person whom you seek spent time in town, then chances are someone saw him there.The Trogg Threat^12^Alliance^Loch Modan^Captain Rugelfuss^Captain Rugelfuss^^^^Bring 8 Trogg Stone Teeth to Captain Rugelfuss in the southern guard tower.^<class>, you may or may not be aware of the Trogg threat looming over Dwarven lands. With the Ironforge Reserve called up to the Alliance Front, we are left with a fraction of the defense forces needed to keep these lands safe. My regiment is assigned to watch over the Gate here and we cannot leave our post for fear of invasion. But we need some pressure put on those damned Troggs lurking in the hills. If you're up to the task, wage an assault on the Troggs. Bring me back 8 Trogg Stone Teeth as proof.Return to Sven^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Jitters^Sven Yorgen^Sven's Revenge^^^Return to Sven with Jitters' completed journal.^The book you found was only half finished. I had to leave it at Sven's farm when I fled there... Here. Take my completed journal to Sven. It describes more fully what happened at his farm. Although this journal has been my only company these past weeks, if giving it up keeps me from having to face Sven and his wrath, then I do it willingly!Seeking Wisdom^29^Alliance^Duskwood^Sven Yorgen^Bishop Farthing^Sven's Revenge^^^Give Jitters' Completed Journal to Bishop Farthing in Stormwind.^Go to the city of Stormwind and speak with Bishop Farthing in the Cathedral of Light. Give him Jitters' journal and tell him you mean to face Morbent Fel. Although Stormwind has forsaken Darkshire, Farthing is a kind soul and very wise. He may help you on your quest to save us. Your mission is perilous, but hurry, <name>. With each passing hour, the shadows of Duskwood grow ever darker.The Doomed Fleet^29^Alliance^Duskwood^Bishop Farthing^Glorin Steelbrow^Sven's Revenge^^^Go to Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands, and speak with Glorin Steelbrow.^Years ago, the Third Fleet of Kul Tiras sunk along the coasts of The Wetlands, an expanse of marsh north of the dwarven kingdom of Ironforge. Aboard one ship was a load of Lightforge Iron. This metal is precious to us, for items crafted from it strike with holy truth. If you are to face Morbent Fel, then you will need such a weapon. Go to Menethil Harbor and speak with my dwarven colleague Glorin Steelbrow. If that lost metal can be found, he'll know where to look.Vyrin's Revenge^20^Alliance^Loch Modan^Vyrin Swiftwind^Daryl the Youngling^Vyrin's Revenge^A Hunter's Challenge^^Kill Ol' Sooty then show your handiwork to Daryl the Youngling at the Farstrider Lodge.^I don't suppose you'd be interested in a little payback for His Boldness? Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say. A year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye. Kill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once. The bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the hills over Thelsamar.Trial of the Sea Lion^16^Night Elf^Druid^Tajarri^Dendrite Starblaze^A Lesson to Learn^^^Find the Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility and the Half Pendant of Aquatic Endurance. Speak with the residents of Moonglade to learn clues as to where these items may be located.^For the second trial, you'll need the two halves that make the Pendant of the Sea Lion. One half draws power from the agility of the sea lion aspect, gliding through water; the other draws power from the incredible endurance of the sea lion aspect. Druids draw on both these traits equally to embody the aspect of their aquatic form. Speak with the locals of Moonglade to learn where the parts may lie, and bring both here to join them together. Once formed, take the pendant to Dendrite Starblaze.Resupplying the Excavation^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Jern Hornhelm^Huldar^Excavation Progress Report^^^Speak with Huldar.^It's not too late though, you're welcome to go look for Huldar. He can't have made it very far, strong as they are, Miran and Saean can only move so fast laden down with those barrels. They're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch. Shouldn't have a problem finding them unless they've already gotten there.A Dark Threat Looms^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Ashlan Stonesmirk^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^A Dark Threat Looms^^^Ashlan Stonesmirk wants you to return to Chief Engineer Hinderweir in Loch Modan and inform him of the new discovery.^This ain't no ordinary blast powder. Look at the tiny silver crystals. And the distinct smell! Why it's clear as daylight that this is Seaforium Powder. Seaforium is harmless enough. But once it's wet it could blow Ironforge out of the mountain. The chemical reaction can be defused by mixing four components: lurker venom, crushed Mo'Grosh crystal, a crocolisk tear and this disarming colloid. Now tell Hinderweir before it's too late!Blisters on The Land^26^Alliance^Wetlands^Rethiel the Greenwarden^Rethiel the Greenwarden^The Greenwarden^^^Kill 8 Fen Creepers, then return to Rethiel the Greenwarden in the Wetlands.^I do not know why, but a festering grows within the Wetlands. Fen Creepers have risen. They are diseased, fevered blisters on the land, and for the fever to break they must be dispatched and allowed to settle back into the marshes. The Fen Creepers shamble amidst the waterways of the Wetlands.Tramping Paws^21^Alliance^Wetlands^Rethiel the Greenwarden^Rethiel the Greenwarden^The Greenwarden^^^Kill 15 Mosshide Gnolls and 10 Mosshide Mongrels, then return to Rethiel the Greenwarden in the Wetlands.^The Mosshide Gnolls have lived in the Wetlands peacefully for many years, but now grow in numbers. Their feet stamp flat the fen's bushes and flowers, and their foul axes cut too much wood to fuel their fires. They are no longer in balance with the land. For the Wetlands to survive, the Gnolls must be reduced. Kill 15 Mosshide Gnolls and 10 Mosshide Mongrels. Hunt them to the south, near the Dwarven gate of Algaz. After you do this, return to me.Fire Taboo^23^Alliance^Wetlands^Rethiel the Greenwarden^Rethiel the Greenwarden^The Greenwarden^^^Bring Rethiel the Greenwarden 9 Crude Flints.^The Mosshides are cutting the trees of the Wetlands, using the trees' flesh to warm themselves with fire. I will suffer this pain no longer! Rid the Mosshides of their crude flints, the tools they use to make fire. The flints are borne by all Mosshides except the smaller Mosshide gnolls and Mosshide mongrels.A Dark Threat Looms^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^A Dark Threat Looms^^^Chief Engineer Hinderweir wants you to gather Lurker Venom, a Mo'grosh Crystal, and a Crocolisk Tear.^Begin collecting the disarming materials immediately, <name>. Lurker Venom can be found on the indigenous spiders in Loch Modan. Crocolisk tears are found here in the Loch as well. But a Mo'Grosh crystal will be very difficult to procure. The ogres to the northeast mine them but the crystals are a very rare commodity. We need to be prepared to defuse a Dark Iron attack! Return to me once you've collected the needed items and I will prepare the mixture.Claws from the Deep^22^Alliance^Wetlands^Karl Boran^Karl Boran^Claws from the Deep^^^Kill 12 Bluegill Murlocs.^Murlocs are crawling out from the deep waters and building their villages on the coastline. They are harassing our fishers and merchants and must be stopped. One of these murlocs, Gobbler, skulks with other bluegill murlocs and harries merchants along the road, always then retreating to the safety of the nearby murloc hovels. Our merchants are in jeopardy, and we will pay to secure them. Gobbler prowls the river inlet north of here. Find him, slay his kin, and bring me his head.A Dark Threat Looms^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^Explosive Charge^A Dark Threat Looms^^^Chief Engineer Hinderweir wants you to swim down to the base of the dam, locate the powder keg and stir in the Disarming Mixture to prevent an explosion.^Earlier today I spotted some Dark Iron Insurgents swimming toward the Dam with a large keg. No Mountaineers were on hand to stop them! I'm afraid they've planted the Seaforium at the base of the Dam and it could blow at any minute! Let me combine all these ingredients into the Disarming Mixture. There we go. Now I need you to take this mixture and stir it into the keg before it's too late! Hurry!Reclaiming Goods^25^Alliance^Wetlands^Karl Boran^Damaged Crate^Claws from the Deep^^^Search the crates and barrels at the coastal Murloc camps.^Not long ago a merchant vessel, the Blind Princess, was raided by Murlocs. Although the ship escaped intact, much of its cargo was dragged overboard by the creatures, including a very valuable statuette of Terenas Menethil. We want that statuette recovered. Search the coastal Murloc hovels for crates, barrels and other evidence of lost cargo. Find the Menethil Statuette and return it to me.Senir's Observations^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Grelin Whitebeard^Mountaineer Thalos^The Troll Cave^^Senir's Observations^Speak with Mountaineer Thalos.^I was planning on sending my apprentice to my brother Senir with my report, but I would feel much better were it placed in more... reliable hands. That is, of course, if you wouldn't mind? Hmm... you'll have to take the tunnel to get to Kharanos. Speak with Mountaineer Thalos before going through the tunnel. It's completely infested with troggs now. Follow the road back to Anvilmar, then keep heading east to the tunnel, Thalos is stationed nearby.A Dark Threat Looms^20^Alliance^Loch Modan^Explosive Charge^Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII^A Dark Threat Looms^^^The Disarming Mixture seemed to take effect. Return to Chief Engineer Hinderweir to report the good news.^The keg fizzles slightly.The Search Continues^25^Alliance^Wetlands^Damaged Crate^Sealed Barrel^Claws from the Deep^^^Search for the Menethil Statuette.^You thoroughly search this cluster of Murloc hovels, and find no trace of the Menethil Statuette. Perhaps one of the two nearby hovels to the north and northeast will have more clues.Search More Hovels^25^Alliance^Wetlands^Sealed Barrel^Half-buried Barrel^Claws from the Deep^^^Continue searching the Murloc hovels for the Menethil Statuette.^This grouping of Murloc hovels, after a thorough inspection, reveals nothing. ...but you're certain that the next clue you find will be fruitful. One of the hovels to the north must have the Menethil Statuette!Return the Statuette^25^Alliance^Wetlands^Half-buried Barrel^Karl Boran^Claws from the Deep^^^Bring Karl Boran at Menethil Harbor in Wetlands the Menethil Statuette.^After pulling the barrel free from the muck and opening it, a silvery figurine is found packed in fine straw. It depicts a young, long-haired Paladin with hammer upraised. This must be the Menethil Statuette! You must now return it to Karl Boran in Menethil Harbor.Frostmane Hold^9^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Senir Whitebeard^Senir Whitebeard^Frostmane Hold^Senir's Observations^^Explore Frostmane Hold, and kill 5 Frostmane Headhunters for Senir Whitebeard in Kharanos.^I'm behind on my report, and could use your help, <name>. I just managed to find where the trolls are holed up, but I saw so many trolls, I was afraid to go in. Here's what I need... Go down to the cave, poke around inside, kill a few of the trolls, then come back here. Take the road north out of Kharanos, when you get to the bridge, follow the frozen river west until you reach Iceflow Lake. You'll find Brewnall Village on the west bank. The Hold is southwest of the village.The Third Fleet^27^Alliance^Wetlands^First Mate Fitzsimmons^First Mate Fitzsimmons^The Third Fleet^^^Buy First Mate Fitzsimmons a Flagon of Mead.^I was once First Mate on the Wave Mistress, ship-of-the-line in the Kul Tiras Third Fleet. The Doomed Fleet. Doomed, for on its last voyage the fleet was attacked by Red Dragons. Dragons controlled by Orcs! We didn't stand a chance against that dragonfire...and our fleet was burned and sunk off this here coast. I'm the sole survivor of those poor vessels... ...Oh, my head hammers and pounds! I'll need a fresh drink if I'm to get a handle on this hangover and continue my tale.The Cursed Crew^29^Alliance^Wetlands^First Mate Fitzsimmons^First Mate Fitzsimmons^The Third Fleet^^^Kill 13 Cursed Sailors, 5 Cursed Marines and First Mate Snellig. Bring Snellig's Snuffbox to First Mate Fitzsimmons in Menethil Harbor.^<Bolstered, Fitzsimmons continues his tale...> I am the sole survivor of the ill-fated Third Fleet of Kul Tiras, wrecked off the coast to the north. But although I'm the only member of the fleet still breathing, I'm not the only one still walking about! For on one of our ships was hidden a great, and terrible treasure, and the eerie power of it keeps the souls of my brothers trapped within the ships' rotting hulls. But if you can free some of my brothers, then perhaps you can break their curse.Lifting the Curse^30^Alliance^Wetlands^First Mate Fitzsimmons^Intrepid's Locked Strongbox^The Third Fleet^^^Get the Intrepid Strongbox Key from Captain Halyndor.^To break the curse and free all of my brethren, the...thing...stowed on my ship must be retrieved and cleansed! I don't know what it was, but I do know that it was stored securely in the ship's strongbox, which Captain Halyndor lorded over. My old captain is still in my dreams. I know he walks my doomed ship, the Intrepid. Get the key from him, and use it to open the Intrepid's strongbox. Then, after you have the cursed thing, bring it to the priest Glorin Steelbrow in town.The Reports^10^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Senir Whitebeard^Senator Barin Redstone^Frostmane Hold^^^Deliver Senir's report to Senator Barin Redstone in Ironforge.^Excellent! Take my report to Senator Barin Redstone. He's a sour type, so don't let his less-than-sunny disposition get to you. He's in Ironforge, in the chamber where King Magni holds court. Don't know the way to Ironforge? Take the road out of Kharanos north, cross the bridge, then follow the road east--there are large banners flanking the road--up the mountainside. By the way, if you might avoid mentioning how you assisted me? Can't let them think I'm not working hard out here, you know?The Eye of Paleth^30^Alliance^Wetlands^Intrepid's Locked Strongbox^Glorin Steelbrow^The Third Fleet^^^Bring the Cursed Eye of Paleth to Glorin Steelbrow at Menethil Harbor in Wetlands.^Opening the chest reveals a blackened orb, pulsing with an eerie light. It is the treasure of which Fitzsimmons spoke: a Cursed Eye of Paleth. Take the Cursed Eye of Paleth to the dwarven priest Glorin Steelbrow, in Menethil Harbor. Ask him how to remove the Eye's curse.Cleansing the Eye^30^Alliance^Wetlands^Glorin Steelbrow^Archbishop Benedictus^The Third Fleet^^^Bring Archbishop Benedictus the Cursed Eye of Paleth. Benedictus is in the Cathedral of Light, in the city of Stormwind.^I can't lift the curse from the Eye of Paleth. The Eyes were crafted by Human Priests, so you'll have to go to Stormwind to find someone who can help you. Speak with Archbishop Benedictus. He is head of the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind. He can help. I hope, for your sake.Ormer's Revenge^24^Alliance^Wetlands^Ormer Ironbraid^Ormer Ironbraid^Ormer's Revenge^^^Ormer Ironbraid at the Whelgar Excavation Site wants you to kill 10 Mottled Screechers and 10 Mottled Raptors.^The situation is severe, that much is for sure. When we uncovered these bones it attracted the Raptors. These filthy beasts killed my brethren and trapped me, Merrin and the poor Prospector up here. Help clear the Wetlands of these Raptors, <name>. Mottled Raptors and Mottled Screechers are just West of the bluff there. Kill 10 of each, if you can. That will be a good start to the vengeance I have planned for them.Ormer's Revenge^27^Alliance^Wetlands^Ormer Ironbraid^Ormer Ironbraid^Ormer's Revenge^^^Ormer Ironbraid wants you to kill 10 Mottled Scytheclaw raptors and 10 Mottled Razormaw raptors then return to him at the Whelgar Excavation Site.^Now it's time to really make those dreaded Raptors regret their blood-thirst. Just down below there are scores of Mottled Scytheclaws and Mottled Razormaws. Make those rotten creatures pay by slaying 10 of each!Ormer's Revenge^29^Alliance^Wetlands^Ormer Ironbraid^Ormer Ironbraid^Ormer's Revenge^^^Ormer Ironbraid at the Whelgar Excavation Site wants you to kill Sarltooth and return to him with one of his talons once the task is fulfilled.^While you were down there I happened to notice that one of those beasts stood out from the rest. He was bigger and more menacing. I bet he's the one who led the others here to cause the disruption to the dig site. I ask of you now one final task, <name>. See to it that Sarltooth is brought to justice. And considering the gravity of his crimes, justice in this case means death! Bring me one of his talons as proof of his death.Gathering Idols^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Magmar Fellhew^Magmar Fellhew^Ironband's Excavation^^^Bring Magmar Fellhew 8 Carved Stone Idols.^Recently, just before the Troggs surfaced within the site, we had uncovered a large number of strange, carved idols. But we didn't have the chance to study them, for soon after their discovery the Troggs chased us away from the ruins! And those idols have a strange effect on the Troggs. It makes them go berserk! Bring me 8 idols - I want to study them, and I want them out of Trogg hands! You can find the idols on the Troggs infesting the site.Excavation Progress Report^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Prospector Ironband^Jern Hornhelm^Excavation Progress Report^^^Bring Ironband's Progress Report to Jern Hornhelm in Thelsamar.^I need a progress report sent to Thelsamar - a progress report, and a restatement of my request for more blastpowder! Here's the report. Take it to Jern Hornhelm. He's our local contact in Thelsamar. It's not a difficult task, but it must be done.Uncovering the Past^28^Alliance^Wetlands^Prospector Whelgar^Prospector Whelgar^^^^Prospector Whelgar wants you to scour the excavation site in search of the 4 missing tablet fragments: Ados, Modr, Golm and Neru.^Just before the invasion I uncovered a large tablet called the Goaz Stone. The translated text breaks off in 4 places. The text speaks of a "divine plan" and a "doomed prophecy." I fear we are running out of time. I am too old to go down and brave those beasts. But you are strong. Scour the excavation site and uncover the 4 missing tablet fragments: Ados, Modr, Golm and Neru. Search for them in ancient artifacts or where the soil is loose. Bring them to me so I can begin unlocking the mystery!Report to Ironforge^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Jern Hornhelm^Prospector Stormpike^Excavation Progress Report^^^Take Ironband's Progress Report to Prospector Stormpike.^We'll need approval to get Ironband more blastpowder. You'll have to take his report to the Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge. Here's the report. Give it to Prospector Stormpike, and don't forget to duck after you deliver it. Stormpike is hotheaded, and he won't be happy to hear of Ironband's slow progress at the site. You'll find Stormpike in the Assembly of Explorers.Powder to Ironband^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Prospector Stormpike^Jern Hornhelm^Excavation Progress Report^^^Speak with Jern Hornhelm at Thelsamar in Loch Modan.^If Ironband still needs blastpowder, then by Magni he'll have it! I sent the approval on ahead with a messenger to Jern Hornhelm in Thelsamar. He'll prepare the powder and other supplies to take to Ironband. And one more thing: I want you to personally see that the shipment of powder reaches its destination. The last one didn't, so keep your mind sharp and your eyes open.The Dark Iron War^30^Alliance^Wetlands^Motley Garmason^Motley Garmason^^^The Fury Runs Deep^Motley Garmason at Dun Modr wants you to kill 10 Dark Iron Dwarves, 5 Dark Iron Tunnelers, 5 Dark Iron Saboteurs and 5 Dark Iron Demolitionists.^War rages both home and abroad. While mighty Dwarven soldiers give their lives in far off territories in the name of the Alliance, our own lands fall prey to the evil deeds of the Dark Iron Dwarves. They laid waste to the Thandol Span. Dun Modr fell soon after. We need you to gather force and push the front back. If you can kill 10 Dark Iron Dwarves, 5 Tunnelers, 5 Saboteurs and 5 Demolitionists, the reserve might arrive in time to finish the drive. Now make haste!A Grim Task^31^Alliance^Wetlands^Longbraid the Grim^Longbraid the Grim^^^^Kill Balgaras the Foul and bring his ear to Longbraid the Grim outside of Dun Modr.^Many of my soldiers died in the battle of Dun Modr. My own brother perished when the West Bridge over the Thandol Span was destroyed. Aye, the Dark Iron dwarves are a devilish breed. From what Roggo was able to gather, the leader of the thugs in the Wetlands is a warlock named Balgaras the Foul. He is quite a coward, sending his soldiers to do his bidding but hides in his camp on Direforge Hill, to the southeast. If you can find the spineless scum, slay him and bring me his ear. I will reward you, <class>.In Search of The Excavation Team^24^Alliance^Wetlands^Tarrel Rockweaver^Merrin Rockweaver^In Search of The Excavation Team^^^Tarrel Rockweaver wants you to travel to the Excavation Site and contact Merrin Rockweaver.^Oh my, you must be the scout Longbraid said he would send! You cannot imagine how worried I have been. My wife, Merrin, has been sending me letters each week for the past month. She is part of the Whelgar Excavation team. But it has been nearly two weeks since her last correspondence. Surely something is wrong! Longbraid said that he would send a scout to check up on things if we did not hear from the team soon. I assume that scout is you, <name>. Find Merrin at the excavation site to the east!In Search of The Excavation Team^24^Alliance^Wetlands^Merrin Rockweaver^Tarrel Rockweaver^In Search of The Excavation Team^^^Return to Tarrel Rockweaver at Menethil Harbor in Wetlands with Merrin's note.^It was horrible! We were uncovering some rare artifacts and we began to discover these large bones. Before we knew what was happening, these Mottled Raptors overwhelmed the dig site. Many lives were lost. Ormer here -- so brave -- saved the Prospector and me. He defended us as we ran for shelter. Now we are trapped. And our hard work lies in ruin. Here, take this note back to my sweet Tarrel. It will explain the situation to him.Filthy Paws^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Stormpike^Mountaineer Stormpike^^^^Go to the Silver Stream Mine and collect 4 loads of Miners' Gear.^The Silver Stream Mine to the east ran dry long ago. It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now Kobolds have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, Dwarven tools! We'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things. It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side. The gear is stored in Miners' League Crates throughout the mine. Good luck.Protecting the Shipment^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Miran^Prospector Ironband^^After the Ambush^^Ensure Miran and the shipment arrive at the excavation site, then inform Prospector Ironband.^Ready to go, <name>? First, we need to get this powder to Ironband. It'll be a lot for me to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for me. I'll feel a lot better with you coming along.Bitter Rivals^6^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Marleth Barleybrew^Unguarded Thunder Ale Barrel^Bitter Rivals^^^In the basement of the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos, replace a barrel of Thunder Ale with a Barrel of Barleybrew Scalder.^I have to admit, those Thunderbrews make some good drinks. But they need to learn that theirs isn't the only decent brew! Maybe you can help me teach them that lesson... Here, take this barrel of Barleybrew Scalder. Sneak into the basement of the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos and switch it with one of their barrels of Thunder Ale. Then we'll see how their patrons like my brew over theirs! And if the barrels are guarded, then you might have to distract the guard ...Return to Marleth^7^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Unguarded Thunder Ale Barrel^Marleth Barleybrew^Bitter Rivals^^^Bring the barrel of Thunder Ale to Marleth Barleybrew at the Brewnall Village.^Having inserted a barrel of Marleth's Scalder in the Kharanos Distillery's cellar, you grab a barrel of Thunder Ale as proof of the deed...Tundra MacGrann's Stolen Stash^12^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Tundra MacGrann^Tundra MacGrann^^^^Retrieve Tundra MacGrann's dried meats from the stolen meat locker in Old Icebeard's cave.^I had a month's worth of dried meats salted and locked away for the cold season. Kept it locked so the bears wouldn't get it! But while I was off hunting deer, that beast, Old Icebeard, made off with the meat locker. He won't be able to smash through that Thorium though. But I'll starve if I can't get my meats back. You seem a bit more stealthy than me. Perhaps you can retrieve my stash? I'll never make it in and out of that cave fast enough with this bum leg of mine.The Grizzled Den^7^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Pilot Stonegear^Pilot Stonegear^^^^Gather 8 Wendigo Manes and bring them to Pilot Stonegear.^Driving a Siege Engine isn't for everyone. It takes an iron grip and nerves of steel...lucky I have both! How about you? How's your mettle? Want to prove it to me? Well...I'm looking to make my engine, Trollplow, a little more cozy. How about you get me a heap of Wendigo Manes from the Grizzled Den, west of Kharanos. Those manes would make a great rug for Trollplow's inside deck!Protecting the Herd^12^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Rudra Amberstill^Rudra Amberstill^^^^Rudra Amberstill wants you to slay Vagash and bring his fang to her at the Ram ranch.^We heard the cries in the middle of the night. Then this morning, sure enough, the herd was missing two rams. That dastardly beast known as Vagash has been preying on our livelihood. With most of King Magni's army off in distant lands fighting with the Alliance, there is no one to keep Vagash at bay. Perhaps you are brave enough to seek out the beast and slay him. Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you. Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly.The Perfect Stout^9^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Rejold Barleybrew^Rejold Barleybrew^^^Rejold's New Brew^Bring 6 Shimmerweeds to Rejold Barleybrew in the Brewnall Village.^I'm on a quest, a quest to make the perfect stout. I know I can do it -- brewing's in my blood. I just need to find the right recipe... The Frostmane trolls grow a plant, shimmerweed, high up in the hills to the east. They use it in their strange, tribal rituals. We dwarves haven't found much use for it, but it has a unique taste...and I want to experiment with it in my brews! Get me some shimmerweed from Frostmane seers, or swipe it from the trolls' shimmerweed baskets.Stocking Jetsteam^6^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Pilot Bellowfiz^Pilot Bellowfiz^Stocking Jetsteam^^^Gather 4 Chunks of Boar Meat and 2 Thick Bear Furs, and deliver them to Pilot Bellowfiz at Steelgrill's Depot.^I'm preparing to start a mission for the Siege Brigade. It's a long one, and I need to stock Jetsteam with a month's worth of supplies. So while Steelgrill is working on my tank, can you do some hunting for me? I'll need some fur for bedding, and boar meat for food. You can get meat from boars and fur from the bears... you can find them both in the snow fields south of the Grizzled Den.Evershine^7^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Pilot Bellowfiz^Rejold Barleybrew^Stocking Jetsteam^^^Get a cask of Evershine from Rejold Barleybrew in Brewnall Village.^Rejold Barleybrew experiments with his brews. Some of them taste good, some bad, and some...well, some will lay all but the stoutest dwarf flat. He lives at Brewnall Village, west of Kharanos, and one of his drinks, Evershine, is what I want. It'll help keep me warm while I'm on the cold road. And...the blessed stuff burns so hot I can throw it in Jetsteam's furnace for a burst of power! That little tactic has gotten me out of more than one tight spot.A Favor for Evershine^8^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Rejold Barleybrew^Rejold Barleybrew^Stocking Jetsteam^^^Kill 6 Ice Claw Bears, 8 Elder Crag Boars, and 8 Snow Leopards, and then return to Rejold Barleybrew in Brewnall Village.^I have a cask of Evershine handy, but...can you do me a favor? Brewnall village could use a hand against the wild animals that wander the nearby snows. Sometimes they wander close. We're not afraid of these bears and cats and boars - no self respecting dwarf would be - but if you can take care of those animals for us, then we'd have more time for our crafting and brewing.Return to Bellowfiz^8^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Rejold Barleybrew^Pilot Bellowfiz^Stocking Jetsteam^^^Give the cask of Evershine to Pilot Bellowfiz at Steelgrill's Depot.^Here's your cask of Evershine, <name>. And again, thank you for the hunting earlier.Lightforge Iron^29^All^Duskwood^Glorin Steelbrow^Waterlogged Chest^Sven's Revenge^^^Search the wreckage of The Flying Osprey in the Wetlands.^The shipwrecks off the shore here are the doomed Third Fleet of Kul'Tiras, burned and sunk by Red Dragons during the last Great War. The Fleet hailed from Lordaeron, but one ship, an Elvish Destroyer: Flying Osprey, was with it. It was shipping a load of Lightforge Iron and joined the Third Fleet for protection. Ironic that it sunk to the same dragons... Enough history. The Flying Osprey is wrecked to the south of Menethil Harbor. If you find the Lightforge Iron there, bring it to me.Blessed Arm^29^Alliance^Duskwood^Glorin Steelbrow^Grimand Elmore^Sven's Revenge^^^Take the Crate of Lightforge Ingots to Grimand Elmore in Stormwind.^There is a dwarven weaponsmith in the Dwarven District of Stormwind who can craft with lightforge iron. His name is Grimand Elmore. I've packed the iron you found into a crate. Take it to Grimand and tell him your tale. I'm sure he'll oblige someone on a quest such as yours, and craft for you a weapon - a weapon to give even Morbent Fel worry!Proving Your Worth^28^Alliance^Duskwood^Sven Yorgen^Sven Yorgen^Sven's Revenge^^^Kill 15 Skeletal Raiders, 3 Skeletal Healers and 3 Skeletal Warders, and then return to Sven.^Morbent Fel is a necromancer, and an ally to the dark riders. I would pit you against the power of Morbent Fel, but I will not send you against that vile fiend without first knowing your strength. You have already proven your bravery to me, but if you truly wish to face the necromancer, then you must now prove your skill against his minions.The Lost Ingots^29^Alliance^Duskwood^Waterlogged Chest^Glorin Steelbrow^Sven's Revenge^^Lightforge Ingots^Gather 5 Lightforge Ingots, then return to Glorin Steelbrow in the Wetlands.^Having grabbed the single lightforge ingot from the waterlogged chest, it is clear that murlocs have stolen the rest. Hunt the murloc raiders near the Flying Osprey wreckage for the lost lightforge iron.Armed and Ready^29^All^Duskwood^Grimand Elmore^Sven Yorgen^Sven's Revenge^^^Bring Morbent's Bane to Sven in Duskwood.^Here is the weapon against the fiend of which you spoke. You're all ready, <name>. Best of luck to you, and I look forward to your tale of glory!The Hidden Key^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Bookie Herod's Records^Bookie Herod's Strongbox^Jungle Secrets^^^Use the Small Brass Key to open Bookie Herod's Strongbox.^Although no mention of Private Thorsen is found in these records, hidden within the binding of one of Herod's ledger books is a small, brass key. And after further study of his notes, a few references to a "secure strongbox" are contained among various papers. The box is somewhere within the Stockpile - the cavern complex at the back of Kurzen's Compound. If this secure strongbox is found, and the small brass key can open it, then perhaps the mystery behind Thorsen's detection will be revealed.The Spy Revealed!^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Bookie Herod's Strongbox^Lieutenant Doren^Jungle Secrets^^^Take the Muddy Note to Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp.^Among the valuables of the strongbox is a muddy, scribbled note. Although barely legible, it looks to be an itinerary for Private Thorsen. It details his patrol routes, who he speaks with and how he spends his time with the rebels. It's signed with only one letter: -M. But whoever wrote this note must have stayed very close to Thorsen. Whoever wrote this note is the traitor within the rebel camp.Patrol Schedules^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Lieutenant Doren^Corporal Sethman^Jungle Secrets^^^Speak with Corporal Sethman.^The note you gave me is signed with an "-M"...I don't know what that could mean. But...the note also says this person shared patrol routes with Thorsen last week. So whoever shared patrol with Thorsen last week must be the traitor! Go to Corporal Sethman. He handles the patrol schedules and can tell you who was with Thorsen.Report to Doren^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Corporal Sethman^Lieutenant Doren^Jungle Secrets^^^Speak with Lieutenant Doren.^Did Lieutenant Doren want you to report back to him with that patrol information?Wine Shop Advert^2^Alliance^Stormwind City^Renato Gallina^Suzetta Gallina^^^^Go to the Gallina Winery, and bring Suzetta Gallina the Wine Ticket for a free bottle of wine.^If you talk to anyone about wine, then you know we Gallinas sell the best wine in Stormwind. And we're not far, still in the Trade District along the city's lovely canals. Here, take this pamphlet. Bring it to my sister Suzetta at our shop for a complimentary bottle of our famous pinot noir. You won't regret it!Harlan Needs a Resupply^2^Alliance^Stormwind City^Harlan Bagley^Rema Schneider^^^^Go to the Canal Tailor Shop and bring Rema Schneider the Cloth Request from Harlan Bagley.^We've been doing a lot of business lately. It seems like everyone is buying armor and sturdy clothes. Almost like they expect a cold, harsh season ahead... But those are future worries. My worry today is that I'm running out of knitted clothing to sell. I need another load from our supplier. If you can take this request to Rema Schneider at the Canal Tailor and Fit Shop, I'd be most grateful.Package for Thurman^2^Alliance^Stormwind City^Rema Schneider^Thurman Schneider^^^^Go to the Larson Clothiers in the Stormwind Mage Quarter, and give Thurman Schneider his Sewing Kit.^My son Thurman is an apprentice at the Larson Clothiers, in the Mage's Quarter. He was in a hurry today and forgot his shears and needles. I know a great <class> like you must have important tasks at hand, but without his tools Thurman can't do his apprentice work! Please, <name>. Can you take my son's sewing kit to him? Larson Clothiers is one of two clothing shops in the Mage's Quarter - it's the one deeper in, near the Mage's Tower.A Noble Brew^30^Alliance^Stormwind City^Zardeth of the Black Claw^Zardeth of the Black Claw^A Noble Brew^^^Zardeth the Black Claw wants you to bring him a Tear of Tilloa from Darkshire and a Musquash Root from the Wetlands.^Lord Wishock is causing quite a stir amongst the House of Nobles. He was made aware of our little "establishment" down here and is lobbying for a full investigation. I have a plan to keep Wishock "preoccupied," but I'll need your help. There is a flower growing in the Garden of Stalvan on the outskirts of Darkshire. This small white flower is known as the Tear of Tilloa. I will also need a Musquash Root, found only at the very base of the falls far beneath the Stonewrought Dam in the Wetlands.A Noble Brew^30^Alliance^Stormwind City^Zardeth of the Black Claw^Lord Baurles K. Wishock^A Noble Brew^^You Have Served Us Well^Take the Black Claw Stout to Lord Wishock in the Hall of Petitioners.^Lord Wishock, like all men, has his weaknesses. His happens to be a fondness for liquor. The hypocrisy is astounding. The trite fool spends his days trying to shut down our little "tavern" while his nights are spent upstairs, running up a bill he never pays. Well, let's see how Wishock likes this special brew I have prepared for him: Black Claw stout. It's got quite a kick, <name>. Take it to him and see how he likes it. Most likely the old fool is milling about the Hall of Petitioners.An Old History Book^25^Alliance^Duskwood^An Old History Book^Milton Sheaf^An Old History Book^^^Return the book: The History of Stormwind, to the Stormwind Library.^Although the cover of this book is marred by scratches and caked with mud, the words "The History of Stormwind" can still be read along its spine. Upon opening the book, the seal of the Stormwind Library is clearly stamped on the book's first page. It looks like someone checked out this book, and never returned it...The Green Hills of Stranglethorn^40^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Barnil Stonepot^Barnil Stonepot^^Welcome to the Jungle^^Collect the missing pages from The Green Hills of Stranglethorn manuscript. Once all four chapters are complete, return them to Barnil.^Master Nesingwary will be so upset if he finds out! He trusted me to proofread the manuscript of his novel, The Green Hills of Stranglethorn. Everything was going well, but a large gust of wind blew through the camp and scattered the pages everywhere! I was able to gather most of the pages but many are still strewn about the jungle. Collect the pages to complete each of the four chapters. I will help you organize them. Return the chapters to me once you have all four.Chapter I^40^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Barnil Stonepot^Barnil Stonepot^^^^Bring pages 1, 4, 6, and 8 of Nesingwary's The Green Hills of Stranglethorn to Barnil Stonepot in order to complete Chapter I.^Chapter I was quite riveting! Master Nesingwary sets the backdrop for the story and makes mention of his hunting companions, including me! But that's besides the point. Let me see which pages are still missing. It seems pages 1, 4, 6 and 8 are still out there somewhere in the jungle!Chapter II^40^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Barnil Stonepot^Barnil Stonepot^^^^Bring pages 10, 11, 14 and 16 of Nesingwary's The Green Hills of Stranglethorn to Barnil Stonepot in order to complete Chapter II.^Chapter II was chock full of exciting tales of panther and tiger hunting. I could just kick myself for letting the pages blow away!  It seems I was able to recover all of the pages with the exception of pages 10, 11, 14, and 16.Chapter III^40^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Barnil Stonepot^Barnil Stonepot^^^^Bring pages 18, 20, 21and 24 of Nesingwary's The Green Hills of Stranglethorn to Barnil Stonepot in order to complete Chapter III.^Chapter III was my favorite. It tells of Sir Erlgadin and Lady Rouack's first kill with a dwarven rifle. And the end of Chapter III, why, such a cliffhanger! Looks to me as though we still need pages 18, 20, 21 and 24 to finish the chapter. Those pages are out there somewhere. . .Chapter IV^40^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Barnil Stonepot^Barnil Stonepot^^^^Bring pages 25, 26, and 27 of Nesingwary's The Green Hills of Stranglethorn to Barnil Stonepot in order to complete Chapter IV.^Ah Chapter IV; the big finale! And what an ending it was! We are only missing three pages for this chapter. We need pages 25, 26 and 27 to put Chapter IV back together.Speaking of Fortitude^24^Alliance^Stormwind City^Brother Kristoff^Milton Sheaf^Speaking of Fortitude^^^Go to the Royal Library in Stormwind Keep and speak with Milton Sheaf. He can find for you the book on metallurgy that Brother Kristoff needs for his speech.^I'm giving a speech on the Fortitude of the Spirit, and I'd like to recite passages from a particular book on metallurgy - "The Stresses of Iron." A copy of this book should be in the Royal Library, within Stormwind Keep. Can you retrieve it for me? If so, then may the blessings of the Light be with you! The Royal Library is very large, but the head librarian, Milton Sheaf, knows each shelf like it was his own son. Speak to him, he'll retrieve the book for you.Brother Paxton^24^Alliance^Stormwind City^Milton Sheaf^Brother Paxton^Speaking of Fortitude^^^Speak with Brother Paxton in the Northshire Abbey.^The Stresses of Iron? Yes, I know the book. Quite a good one, written by the Dwarven miner Margulf Blaggon a few decades ago. He spent most his time deep in the mountains of Khaz Modan, digging ore. Smart fellow! But where was I? Oh yes, the Stresses of Iron! I'm afraid the book was moved to the Northshire Abbey. The caretaker of the Abbey's library, Brother Paxton, wanted to make a copy of the book for his own shelves. But that was months ago. I wonder why it's taking him so long...Ink Supplies^24^Alliance^Stormwind City^Brother Paxton^Foreman Oslow^Speaking of Fortitude^^^Speak with Foreman Oslow in Lakeshire and ask him for Rethban Iron Ore.^I've been meaning to finish my copy of The Stresses of Iron, but... Well you see, I make my own ink for books I copy. It's my own recipe; it doesn't run or smear, and it dries very quickly. Unfortunately, it dries too quickly! My last batch dried up before I could finish the copying job, and I haven't had the chance to make more ink! To make more I need Rethban Iron Ore from the Redridge Mountains. Foreman Oslow in Lakeshire is my usual supplier.Return to Kristoff^24^Alliance^Stormwind City^Brother Paxton^Brother Kristoff^Speaking of Fortitude^^^Return to Brother Kristoff in the Cathedral Square. Give him the book The Stresses of Iron.^Now that I've finished copying the book, here's the original Stresses of Iron. Thank you for your patience, and if you see Milton please tell him I'm sorry for the long delay.Rethban Ore^24^Alliance^Stormwind City^Foreman Oslow^Brother Paxton^Speaking of Fortitude^^^Gather 5 loads of Rethban Ore and bring it to Brother Paxton in the Northshire Library.^Rethban Ore is named after the man who first found it, Bart Rethban. When smelted it's not as strong as iron, but its ore has a dark, flat color that some scribes use in their dyes. It can be found in the Rethban Caverns, north of here. We usually have some in stock, but we're too busy preparing for Orc attacks to gather any. And besides...Redridge Gnolls are now living in the Rethban Caverns and their Drudgers are gathering the ore themselves. So if you need some, you'll have to get it yourself.Stranglethorn Fever^45^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Fin Fizracket^Fin Fizracket^^^^Seek out Witch Doctor Unbagwa and have him summon Mokk the Savage. Bring the Heart of Mokk to Fin Fizracket.^Sick...so...very s-s-sick.... ...have contracted Stranglethorn Fever...deadly v-v-virus... ...only cure...is...is...to eat the heart of M-m-m-m-mokk the Savage...elusive white beast... ...Witch doctor Unbagwa...only one who can s-s-summon.... ...seek Unbagwa in hidden cave on southern cape... ...hurry...dying...dying....Look to an Old Friend^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Master Mathias Shaw^Elling Trias^The Unsent Letter^^^Speak to Elling Trias in Stormwind.^That Marzon would be contacting a member of the Defias and have ties to Lescovar... Having killed VanCleef and Thredd, it would be hard to see Lescovar brought to proper justice, as your evidence is nothing without their testimonies. That is not even considering the fact that Lescovar is a noble and well connected. It effectively makes him above the law. You'll need other help. I loathe to do so, but there is someone I know that will aid us. You'll find Trias in the Trade District of the city.Find OOX-17/TN!^48^All^Tanaris^OOX-17/TN Distress Beacon^Homing Robot OOX-17/TN^Find OOX-17/TN!^^^Bring the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot.^You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal. Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption! A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life. "The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing! I will reward you for its recovery! Please take this beacon to the robot. Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you! It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!"Stormpike's Delivery^15^Alliance^Stormwind City^Grimand Elmore^Mountaineer Stormpike^Elmore's Task^^^Deliver the Package for Stormpike to Mountaineer Stormpike in Loch Modan.^The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes. So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon. The weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan. If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him? My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan.Deaths in the Family^11^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Coleman Farthing^Coleman Farthing^^^Speak with Sevren^Bring Gregor's Remains, Nissa's Remains and Thurman's Remains to Coleman Farthing in Brill.^The Agamand family was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades. I used to work their mills...before the Plague. When the Scourge first came, the Agamands fortified their home and convinced those in their employ to remain and help them defend. We were fools, but at least we were loyal fools. The Agamands, in their pride, doomed us to undeath. And now they are minions of the Scourge! Serve the Forsaken by defeating the Agamands who fell to the Plague. Serve me by bringing me their remains.Speak with Sevren^10^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Coleman Farthing^Magistrate Sevren^Speak with Sevren^Deaths in the Family^^Speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill.^You have given me the remains of the Agamands, and satisfied my desire for revenge. But the Agamand Mills hold a threat to all the Forsaken, not just to me. I have spoken to Magistrate Sevren of your exploits against the Agamands, and he wishes to speak with you.Rear Guard Patrol^11^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Linnea^Deathguard Linnea^^^^Kill 8 Bleeding Horrors and 8 Wandering Spirits, then report back to Linnea at her camp.^The defenders on The Bulwark protecting Tirisfal from the Plaguelands are on constant alert. But sometimes Scourge will slip past them. Our success at the Bulwark depends on a one-front battle - we cannot allow an attack from the rear, nor can we allow our defenders' supply line to be cut. Assist the Bulwark. Patrol east and slay any Scourge you find. Spend particular effort at the Balnir Farmstead to the east. It has become a haven for interloping Scourge.The Lich's Identity^8^Horde^Undercity^Bethor Iceshard^Bethor Iceshard^The Prodigal Lich^^^Bring the Lich's Spellbook to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity.^There is a lich who dwells on the island in Brightwater Lake to the north. Although he is a free-willed Forsaken, he believes all other Undead are Scourge slaves and has his minions attack anyone who approaches him. But because he is Forsaken, the Queen will want him. And if he is skilled in Necromancy, then his knowledge would be...quite useful to us. To discover his identity and his talents, I must see his spellbook. Steal into his camp and acquire it, then return to me.Graverobbers^8^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Magistrate Sevren^Magistrate Sevren^^^Forsaken Duties, The Prodigal Lich^Kill Rot Hide Graverobbers and Rot Hide Mongrels.^The Mass Graves, southwest of Garren's Haunt to the north, were made to accommodate the...impressive...number of deaths Tirisfal suffered when the Plague first came. The bodies in these graves have so far been spared an undeath, but the Scourge now send Rot Hide Gnolls to gather the corpses and use them to bolster their armies. This cannot be allowed! Your task is twofold: slay the Rot Hides at the Mass Grave and Garren's Haunt, and gather from them the Embalming Ichor that gives them life.Forsaken Duties^9^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Magistrate Sevren^Deathguard Linnea^Forsaken Duties^Graverobbers^^Speak with Deathguard Linnea.^I need a fresh report from our Deathguard waystation to the east. I must know if more Scourge forces have slipped past The Bulwark and into Tirisfal. Our vigilance on the border to the Plaguelands must be maintained - we can't let the Scourge get a stronger foothold here! Travel south along the road, then east at the fork to the waystation. Speak with Deathguard Linnea. She has the information I need.Return to the Magistrate^9^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Linnea^Magistrate Sevren^Forsaken Duties^^^Return to Magistrate Sevren in Brill.^Now return to Magistrate Sevren with the information I gave you. He'll want it as soon as possible, so be swift. And if you see any Scourge on your way back, take them down - we can't let them wander our lands unchallenged.A Letter Undelivered^7^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^A Letter to Yvette^Yvette Farthing^^^^Find Yvette Farthing, and deliver to her the letter from Thurman Agamand.^This is a letter written by Thurman, the eldest son of Gregor Agamand. It is addressed to an Yvette Farthing, though it does not appear to have reached her...The Haunted Mills^10^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Coleman Farthing^Coleman Farthing^^^^Slay Devlin Agamand, and bring Devlin's Remains to Coleman Farthing in Brill.^Devlin Agamand was the younger of two sons in the Agamand family, and in life the two could not be more different. Thurman was tall and gentle while his younger brother was weak and sharp tongued. When Agamand Mills fell to the Plague, I was not surprised to hear that Devlin was quick to succumb. His mad chattering can still be heard near the road leading to the Agamand Mills. I'm collecting the remains of the Agamands, and I want poor Devlin. Find him, destroy him, and bring me his bones.Rude Awakening^1^Undead^Tirisfal Glades^Undertaker Mordo^Shadow Priest Sarvis^Rude Awakening^^^Speak with Shadow Priest Sarvis.^About time you woke up. We were ready to toss you into the fire with the others, but it looks like you made it. I am Mordo, the caretaker of the crypt of Deathknell. And you are the Lich King's slave no more. Speak with Shadow Priest Sarvis in the chapel at the base of the hill, he will tell you more of what you must know. To get out of this crypt, take the steps up to the surface. Follow the road down to the chapel to find Sarvis.The Mindless Ones^2^All^Tirisfal Glades^Shadow Priest Sarvis^Shadow Priest Sarvis^Rude Awakening^^Simple Scroll, Tainted Scroll, Rattling the Rattlecages^Shadow Priest Sarvis wants you to kill 5 Mindless Zombies and 5 Wretched Ghouls.^We Forsaken are at war with the Lich King's army of the Scourge: necromantically raised armies of the undead, foul beasts of the north, and tormented spectres. The northern part of the village has become overrun with the Mindless Ones, and they must be destroyed. Destroy them, show them no mercy, our former brothers and sisters as they might be. The Fallen are nothing but The Lich King's slaves.Fields of Grief^7^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Simmer^Apothecary Johaan^Fields of Grief^^^Steal 10 pumpkins from the farm to the west, just north of Deathknell and take them to Apothecary Johaan in Brill.^What have we here? You look like a fledgling <class>. If you hope to prove yourself to The Dark Lady, you need to learn the ways of The Forsaken. To the west you'll find a farm. Humans infest the land like mold on a rotting corpse. And worse yet, the Scarlet Crusade patrols nearby from their tower. Teach those scum a lesson and steal 10 of their precious pumpkins. Once you have 10, take them to Apothecary Johaan in Brill.Return the Book^8^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Bethor Iceshard^Gunther Arcanus^The Prodigal Lich^^^Return Gunther's Spellbook to him, on the island of Gunther's Retreat.^Long ago Gunther and I, along with the now Scourge Necromancer Thule Ravenclaw, were friends and students within the Kirin Tor - a society of mages in Dalaran. Gunther and I both fell to the Plague, but I thought he either remained dead, or was raised into the ranks of the Lich King. It is good to know he is free. We must have him. I have placed a spell on his book that, when he sees it, will show him that I too am free of the Lich King. After knowing this, it is my hope that he will join us.A New Plague^6^All^Tirisfal Glades^Apothecary Johaan^Apothecary Johaan^A New Plague^^^Apothecary Johaan in the town of Brill wants you to collect 5 Vials of Darkhound Blood.^Lady Sylvanas has called upon the Royal Apothecary Society. The Dark Lady believes our knowledge coupled with the newfound magic will provide the key to Arthas's demise. She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on Azeroth. This new disease will bring Arthas's Scourge Army to ruin. My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Bring to me 5 vials of darkhound blood so I can test my theory.A New Plague^9^All^Tirisfal Glades^Apothecary Johaan^Apothecary Johaan^A New Plague^^^Apothecary Johaan of the town of Brill needs 5 Vile Fin Scales from Murlocs in Tirisfal Glades.^While you were collecting samples for me, my experiments led me to realize that more reagents will be required for this new disease to spread properly. Poisoning some hapless victim is child's play. Plaguing an entire world proves to be a bit more complicated. I will need 5 Vile Fin Scales from Murlocs in the vicinity. You will find the creatures along the coast to the north or to the west.A New Plague^11^All^Tirisfal Glades^Apothecary Johaan^Apothecary Johaan^A New Plague^^Hallowed Scroll, Glyphic Scroll^Apothecary Johaan in the town of Brill wants you to bring him 4 samples of venom from a Vicious Night Web Spider.^While you were out gathering, I uncovered some old text in one of my tomes that indicates that an ancient plague wiped out thousands of innocent victims. Later it was discovered that the deadly agent in the plague was preserved through the venom of Night Web Spiders. Bring me some venom from a Vicious Night Web Spider to complete this experiment. I want to see if the contagious element from the venom will work with my new concoction. Rumor has it the spiders can be found in Eastern Tirisfal Glades.At War With The Scarlet Crusade^9^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Zygand^Executor Zygand^At War With The Scarlet Crusade^^^Executor Zygand in Brill wants you to kill Captain Perrine, 3 Scarlet Zealots and 3 Scarlet Missionaries.^The strategic documents from Executor Arren contain all the details we need to wipe the human infestation from the lands. According to the information, The Scarlet Crusade has assigned Captain Perrine and a brigade to the ruined tower southwest of Brill. Kill Perrine along with 3 Zealots and 3 Missionaries and report back to me.At War With The Scarlet Crusade^10^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Zygand^Executor Zygand^At War With The Scarlet Crusade^^^Executor Zygand in Brill has commissioned you to slay Captain Vachon and 5 Scarlet Friars.^We are still at war and the Scarlet Crusade grows in strength. The report Executor Arren sent me indicates Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in southeastern Tirisfal near the Balnir Farmstead under the command of Captain Vachon. Kill Vachon along with 5 Scarlet Friars. It should prove to be a devastating blow to the Crusade!At War With The Scarlet Crusade^12^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Zygand^Executor Zygand^At War With The Scarlet Crusade^^^Executor Zygand in the town of Brill wants you to assassinate Captain Melrache and his two bodyguards.^Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in northern Tirisfal, past Faol's Rest. According to the information we have, a ruthless commander named Captain Melrache is in charge of this evil crew. I am entrusting you now with a special and dangerous mission. Slay Melrache and his two bodyguards, in the name of The Dark Lady.The Unsent Letter^22^Alliance^Stormwind City^An Unsent Letter^Baros Alexston^The Unsent Letter^^^Deliver the Letter to the City Architect to Baros Alexston in Stormwind.^Searching Edwin VanCleef's person, you discover, among other things, an unsent letter. It is addressed to Baros Alexston, the City Architect of Stormwind, City Hall, Cathedral Square. It appears to be recently written and sealed.Proof of Demise^7^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Burgess^Deathguard Burgess^^^^Bring 10 Scarlet Insignia Rings to Deathguard Burgess in Brill.^Executor Zygand tells me you've been out killing Scarlet Crusaders. Tirisfal Glades is crawling with them. Varimathras, lieutenant to The Dark Lady, is seeing to it personally that the scum of Azeroth, the Human race, gets wiped into oblivion. Here in Tirisfal Glades we face a particularly annoying breed of humans: The Scarlet Crusade. Venture forth and wage an offensive on the Scarlet Crusade, <class>. Bring me back 10 Scarlet Insignia Rings as proof of your loyalty to Varimathras and The Dark Lady.The Chill of Death^8^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Gretchen Dedmar^Gretchen Dedmar^^^^Bring five Duskbat Pelts and some Coarse Thread to Gretchen Dedmar in Brill.^It's so cold, now. The Plague of Undeath crawls through my veins like an icy serpent. The Mindless State will be upon me soon. But no doomed destiny will prevent me from serving our Dark Lady. When the call arose I sewed body bags for the fallen soldiers of Sylvanas's mighty army. Now my hands shake from the chill. If you would bring me five Duskbat Pelts and some Coarse Thread I could sew myself a blanket. Help me, <name>, so that I can continue to serve the cause.The Damned^2^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Novice Elreth^Novice Elreth^^^Night Web's Hollow, Scavenging Deathknell, Marla's Last Wish^Novice Elreth requires 6 Scavenger Paws and 6 Duskbat Wings.^My duties include tending to our wounded warriors, tailoring armor and clothes, and assisting Shadow Priest Sarvis with whatever else he might need. From the look of it, you'll be enlisted in his service also... hunting the Mindless Ones, if I know his mind. Well, if you'd like to stay in one piece--and I've no doubt you do--perhaps I can help. I'm running out of paws and wings, and if you bring me some, I'll find some armor for you. You'll find a good number of wolves and bats to the south.Crime and Punishment^26^Alliance^The Stockade^Councilman Millstipe^Councilman Millstipe^^^^Councilman Millstipe of Darkshire wants you to bring him the hand of Dextren Ward.^As if the neglect for the residents of Duskwood was not bad enough, now the House of Nobles spits in the eye of the Darkshire Council with their decision to imprison Dextren Ward in Stormwind rather than behead the villain as per Lord Ebonlocke's sentence. Ward was caught selling bodies from the cemetery to Morbent Fel, a crime punishable by death. Yet Stormwind claims Ward as their prisoner. Assassinate Ward in The Stormwind Stockade - bring me his hand - and I shall reward you.The Fury Runs Deep^27^Alliance^The Stockade^Motley Garmason^Motley Garmason^^The Dark Iron War^^Motley Garmason wants Kam Deepfury's head brought to him at Dun Modr.^You have proven your loyalty to King Magni, <class>. And your hatred for the Dark Iron scum is as great as my own. There is a task I wish to complete myself but I am bound by honor to stay with Longbraid. But Roggo has gathered intelligence that proves Kam Deepfury was a conspirator in the attack on the Thandol Span. It was by Deepfury's planning that Longbraid lost his kin. Deepfury is being held for political reasons in the Stormwind Stockade. I want him dead, <name>. For Longbraid! Bring me his head!Slake That Thirst^46^Horde^Tanaris^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Errand for Apothecary Zinge^^Tanaris Field Sampling, Another Power Source?^Bring 5 Wastewander Water Pouches to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle in Gadgetzan.^You want a power source. I can help you with that. Know what I want? I want something to drink! Bring me five Wastewander Water Pouches, and I'll give you the 4711-FTZ. Now... guess where you can find Wastewander Water Pouches! Why don't you walk up to one of the Wastewander nomads to the east of here and ask them for one. Let me know how that works out for you.Night Web's Hollow^4^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Arren^Executor Arren^Night Web's Hollow^The Damned^^Executor Arren wants you to kill 8 Young Night Web Spiders and 5 Night Web Spiders.^One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive. Gold was scarce even in the height of the Alliance's power. There is a gold mine to the northwest that has been overrun with spiders. We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there. I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little. Get up there and see what you can do for us, <name>.The Scarlet Crusade^4^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Arren^Executor Arren^Night Web's Hollow^^^Bring Executor Arren 12 Scarlet Armbands from Scarlet Converts and Scarlet Initiates.^You'll be happy to know we appear to be making progress in the mine, thanks in no small part to your efforts. We can now turn our eyes to other concerns. My scouts have reported that a detachment of the Scarlet Crusade is setting up a camp southeast of here. The Scarlet Crusade is a despicable organization that hunts us, and they will not rest until every undead--Lich King's Scourge or no--is destroyed. We must strike first! Be careful, their unholy zeal makes them dangerous adversaries.The Red Messenger^5^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Arren^Executor Arren^Night Web's Hollow^^Vital Intelligence^Kill Meven Korgal, the messenger, at the Crusader camp, then return any information you find to Executor Arren.^Reports from my superiors in Brill indicate that an agent of the Scarlet Crusade was dispatched from the Scarlet Monastery and sent here to Deathknell. According to the reports, the messenger possesses important information on his person. I do not have further details, but whatever it is, we must have it! You're the most qualified person I have to send, <name>. Find that messenger and bring me whatever information you can find.Vital Intelligence^5^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Arren^Executor Zygand^^The Red Messenger^At War With The Scarlet Crusade^Deliver the Scarlet Crusade Documents to Executor Zygand in Brill.^These will need to be taken to my superior, Executor Zygand, in Brill. With this information, we'll be able to deal a decisive blow to the Scarlet Crusade. Your services have been useful here in Deathknell, but I need someone to deliver this to Zygand, and I believe he'll be able to find you more appropriate work. Take the road north out of Deathknell. Soon after entering Tirisfal proper, you'll hit a crossroads. Take the eastern fork, and keep going east. You'll pass Cold Hearth Manor along the way.Beer Basted Boar Ribs^7^Alliance^Cooking^Ragnar Thunderbrew^Ragnar Thunderbrew^^^^Ragnar Thunderbrew in Kharanos wants 6 Crag Boar Ribs and a mug of Rhapsody Malt.^Nothing my tavern patrons enjoy more than some Beer Basted Boar Ribs! Only problem is, the local trapper who used to bring me supplies enlisted in the King's Army to help with the war on the Alliance front. Maybe you can help me out? If you bring me six crag boar ribs and a Rhapsody Malt from the tavern here, I'll give you the family recipe for my famous Beer Basted Boar Ribs, not to mention a free sample! The secret's in the Malt!Crocolisk Hunting^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Marek Ironheart^Marek Ironheart^^^^Get 5 pieces of Crocolisk Meat and 6 Crocolisk Skins for Marek Ironheart at the Farstrider Lodge.^Many a hunter is attracted to Loch Modan to hunt our famous crocs. There are always merchants who seek out crocolisk skins for clothing items or armor, and there are also some who enjoy the taste of their meat. We do some trade in this, but not a huge amount, as the crocolisks are ferocious and have entrenched themselves on the islands in the Loch. But don't let me dissuade you, it's quite an experience, wrestling with the jaws of the beasts. Why, this one time...What Comes Around...^25^Alliance^The Stockade^Guard Berton^Guard Berton^^^^Bring the head of Targorr the Dread to Guard Berton in Lakeshire.^Targorr the Dread served under Gath'Ilzogg as supreme Executioner. His methods were ruthless, even by filthy orc standards. Men who fought bravely to defend the Kingdom were tortured on his whim. Now he is being held in the Stormwind Stockade, sentenced to die. Yet something is amiss. One of the bureaucratic nobles put a hold on his execution. I am sure foul play is in the works. Put an end to Targorr the Dread, <name>. Travel to The Stockade and behead him before trickery is upon us.Quell The Uprising^26^Alliance^The Stockade^Warden Thelwater^Warden Thelwater^^^^Warden Thelwater of Stormwind wants you to kill 10 Defias Prisoners, 8 Defias Convicts, and 8 Defias Insurgents in The Stockade.^The uprising must be quelled! I need your assistance. If word gets out that the prison is overrun I will lose my job! This is a case of foul play if I've ever seen one. But what's important now is forcing these prisoners into submission for the safety of Stormwind. The punishment for insurgency is death. Kill some of these deviants! That ought to get things under control.The Color of Blood^26^Alliance^The Stockade^Nikova Raskol^Nikova Raskol^^^^Nikova Raskol of Stormwind wants you to collect 10 Red Wool Bandanas.^Bitterness flows through my veins like a cold river. My grandson, Mac, was such a good boy. A mere 14 years old. When the army was sent off to the front, Mac took up arms to defend the city. He was a guard in The Stockade, where the Defias gang is locked up. Mac reprimanded some of the prisoners for tearing their wool blankets to make scarves, a symbol of their gang. For that Mac was stabbed in the back. I want revenge. Bring me 10 of their precious Wool Bandanas. They are the color of blood.Bazil Thredd^22^Alliance^Stormwind City^Baros Alexston^Warden Thelwater^The Unsent Letter^^^Speak with Warden Thelwater in the Stockade.^VanCleef and I were members of the Stonemasons Guild. Our main project was to rebuild Stormwind after the War. When we had finished our duties, we were cheated. The nobles refused to pay us for our work. Some of the more senior of the Stonemasons were offered governmental jobs, but VanCleef refused it out of loyalty to all the Stonemasons. He led a riot and left the city, swearing revenge. His lieutenant, Bazil Thredd, might know more about VanCleef's plans. He's being held prisoner in the Stockade.The Stockade Riots^29^Alliance^The Stockade^Warden Thelwater^Warden Thelwater^The Unsent Letter^^^Kill Bazil Thredd and bring his head back to Warden Thelwater at the Stockade.^Let's get one thing straight, <name>: I don't trust you. But, with the situation as it is, you probably won't make a difference. So here's how it's going to be: go down there and have your talk with Thredd. If you're really on our side, then kill him and bring me his head when the job's done. And if it turns out you're on his side, and don't come out... when we find you, you'll die along with the rest of the maggots."The Curious Visitor^29^Alliance^Stormwind City^Warden Thelwater^Baros Alexston^The Unsent Letter^^^Bring the Sealed Description of Thredd's Visitor to Baros Alexston in Stormwind.^of Thredd's Visitor to Baros Alexston in Stormwind.

I figured that he was no longer of use to the Brotherhood, so they abandoned him. Anyway, a few months ago, that all changed; he started to get regular visits... once, maybe twice a week. It was a strange man--the quiet type. I had my suspicions, but all his papers checked out. His documents claimed his name was Maelik; here's his description. I don't think he'll be coming to visit Thredd anymore.""Shadow of the Past^29^Alliance^Stormwind City^Baros Alexston^Master Mathias Shaw^The Unsent Letter^^^Bring the Sealed Description of Thredd's Visitor to Master Mathias Shaw in Stormwind.^of Thredd's Visitor to Master Mathias Shaw in Stormwind.

There is someone else who might be able to help you, and it so happens that he owes me a favor for--well, let's not get into that. Master Mathias Shaw of SI:7 can be found in the barracks in Old Town. Shaw has his thumb on most of the shady, or underhanded dealings of the city. If anyone knows, it'd be him."The Head of the Beast^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Elling Trias^Master Mathias Shaw^The Attack!^^^Speak to Mathias Shaw in Stormwind.^Find Shaw in Old Town. Let him know that the Lescovar threat has been dealt with and about your involvement in the Lord's plots against the city. I'm sure he'll be proud to have another hero among Stormwind's citizens. He'll more than likely send you off to meet with the Prince or some other noble. Don't let it get to your head, <name>. The nobles can think they rule the city all they want, but some things remain out of their hands.Brotherhood's End^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Master Mathias Shaw^Baros Alexston^The Attack!^^^Speak with Baros Alexston in Stormwind.^Ah, I almost forgot. Alexston came while you were away, he wished to speak with you. No doubt he wishes to report the goings-on of the Defias Brotherhood to the nobles. A bit of advice, <name>: if anyone should ask, I would provide all details but that it was your hand that slew Lescovar. Trust me. I am... acquainted... with the ways of such things. And as far as Trias goes, well, speak to no one of him... ever... if you can help it.An Audience with the King^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Baros Alexston^King Varian Wrynn^The Attack!^^^Deliver Baros Alexston's report on the Defias Brotherhood to King Varian Wrynn in Stormwind Keep.^I have prepared a report for the King. I believe you should be the one to deliver it to him, along with an account of your findings. Do not worry, there is no doubt that he will commend you for doing your duty to the people of Stormwind. Your audience is scheduled soon, so you'd best hurry, it's a bit of a ways to Stormwind Keep.You Have Served Us Well^30^Alliance^Warlock^Zardeth of the Black Claw^Zggi^^A Noble Brew^^Speak with Zggi, the servant of Zardeth the Blackclaw, to claim your reward.^I hear Lord Wishock enjoyed his beverage. You have served us well, <name>. The Warlocks of Stormwind will be able to practice our ways without disturbance, thanks to you. For your efforts, I have prepared a special gift for you. Speak with my servant, Zggi, and claim your reward.Wanted: Maggot Eye^10^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Wanted!^Executor Zygand^^^^Kill Maggot Eye and return to Executor Zygand in Brill with his paw for a reward.^Wanted: Maggot Eye! A foul beast, even by Gnoll standards, Maggot Eye has been sentenced to death for his crimes against The Forsaken. This despicable villain has been stealing corpses for use by the Lich King's army. Maggot Eye was last seen pillaging the lands near Garren's Haunt to the north of Brill. The town of Brill hereby offers a reward to the capable soul who can carry out the execution. Show Executor Zygand the villain's paw once the deed is done. Mercy is for the weak.Humble Beginnings^15^Alliance^Stormwind City^Baros Alexston^Baros Alexston^^^^Go to Baros Alexston's house in Westfall and search for his compass, then return it to him in Cathedral Square of Stormwind.^It seems an eternity since I was a boy working the farm in Westfall. They say you can never go back, and it's true. Doubly true in my case, my family's home has been burned down and taken over by thieves. I have spoken with my father about the fate of some of my possessions, including my first compass. He was unable to save them. However, he also says that they should be hidden away on the farm. You'll find the Alexston Farmstead west of Sentinel Hill. Perhaps you could go and retrieve it for me?Tools for Steelgrill^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Tharek Blackstone^Beldin Steelgrill^^^^Deliver Steelgrill's Tools to Beldin Steelgrill.^Beldin Steelgrill owns the local mechanic shop, and he's the best siege engine tech there is! But he's not forgiving to his tools. I swear he almost breaks more arclight spanners than we can supply him with! We just filled his last order for tools. If you deliver it to him I'm sure he'll make it worth the effort. His shop, Steelgrill's Depot, is just northeast of Kharanos. And it's a local haunt for veteran siege engine pilots, so keep your ears open for opportunities while you're there.Wait for Sirra to Finish^30^Alliance^Duskwood^Sirra Von'Indi^Sirra Von'Indi^Wait for Sirra to Finish^Translate Abercrombie's Note^^Wait a moment, then speak with Sirra Von'Indi again.^I'm almost finished translating that note. If you come back in a few moments I should be done.A Putrid Task^6^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Dillinger^Deathguard Dillinger^^^The Mills Overrun^Bring 7 Putrid Claws to Deathguard Dillinger in Brill.^Scourge have trickled into Tirisfal Glades and have infested the area west of Brill, near the old bridge. Go there and beat back the rotting dead and ravaged corpses you find. Scatter their bones and bring back their putrid claws, and the Deathguards will reward you.The Prodigal Lich^8^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Magistrate Sevren^Bethor Iceshard^The Prodigal Lich^Graverobbers^^Present Sevren's Orders to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity.^Bethor Iceshard, a high-ranking and powerful mage in the Undercity to the south, commands me to send him an agent with proven worth against the Scourge. You, <name>, will be that agent. Present these orders to Bethor. He will then instruct you on your mission. I don't know its details, but it deals with recruiting a wayward Lich. And it will be dangerous. So ready yourself, <class>. You must not fail. You may find Bethor in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity.Fields of Grief^7^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Apothecary Johaan^Captured Scarlet Zealot^Fields of Grief^^^Take the Laced Pumpkin to the Captured Scarlet Zealot who is being held in the cellar of the Gallow's End Tavern.^Harmless pumpkins, right? Or so it would seem. If we are to defeat Arthas's advances from the North and the Human infestation from the South we need to start realizing the full potential of our gift of undeath. With a little ingenuity a simple pumpkin becomes an agent for our Dark Lady. This pumpkin, laced with my latest formula, will prove to be quite a treat. Yet another Scarlet Zealot has been captured and is being kept in the cellar of the Gallow's End Tavern. Take this pumpkin to the fool.The Family Crypt^13^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Magistrate Sevren^Magistrate Sevren^Speak with Sevren^^^Kill 8 Wailing Ancestors and 8 Rotting Ancestors.^The Agamand Mills area has become a foothold for the Scourge. Their strongest point is the Agamand Family Crypt where their local military leader, a skeleton named Captain Dargol, has headquartered. With Necromancy he has raised the ancestors of the Agamands and plans to use them against us. This cannot pass, and you must stop it. Travel to the Agamand Family Crypt and defeat the raised Agamand ancestors. And, bring me the skull of Captain Dargol.Proving Allegiance^12^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Gunther Arcanus^Gunther Arcanus^The Prodigal Lich^^^Obtain a Candle of Beckoning.^You say you are not bound by the will of the Lich King, and the enchantment Bethor placed upon my book corroborates this. But before I believe you I must have proof that you are enemy to the Scourge. There is an old, bloody altar just off the southern coast of this island. it is used by a powerful Scourge agent, Lillith Nefara. Take a Candle of Beckoning from this crate here. Light it on the altar and Lillith will awake. Destroy Lillith, and I will believe you are the Lich King's foe.The Prodigal Lich Returns^12^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Gunther Arcanus^Bethor Iceshard^The Prodigal Lich^^^Bring the Nether Gem to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity.^Take this Nether Gem to my old comrade Bethor. It will let us communicate ... and I have much to tell him.Operation Recombobulation^10^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Razzle Sprysprocket^Razzle Sprysprocket^^^^Bring Razzle Sprysprocket in Kharanos 8 Restabilization Cogs and 8 Gyromechanic Gears.^Upon further analysis of the Gnomeregan situation, it would appear as though we not only failed to eradicate the troggs but we also happened to turn most of the gnomish race into horrific, mindless, evil-doing leper gnomes. Ozzie and I plan to reverse the horrible leper effect with our latest invention: The Recombobulator. The machine is almost complete but we are in dire need of some Restabilization Cogs and Gyromechanic Gears. Retrieve some from the leper gnomes out front of Gnomeregan for us.Shimmer Stout^10^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Rejold Barleybrew^Mountaineer Barleybrew^Rejold's New Brew^^^Take the Barrel of Shimmer Stout to Mountaineer Barleybrew.^I'd like my brother Wellart to try my new Shimmer Stout. He's a Mountaineer stationed in the southern guard tower, one of two towers on the border to Loch Modan. He may not be a brewer like the rest of us Barleybrews, but he loves his drinks and I know he'll like this one. Can you bring him this Barrel of Shimmer Stout for me?Stout to Kadrell^10^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Mountaineer Barleybrew^Mountaineer Kadrell^Rejold's New Brew^^^Take the Cask of Shimmer Stout to Mountaineer Kadrell in Loch Modan.^I've been drinking more of that Shimmer Stout my brother made - it's great stuff! I want a fellow Mountaineer to try it. His name's Kadrell, and he's usually patrolling the road through Thelsamar in Loch Modan. To get to Thelsamar, go southeast through the tunnel, then turn northeast when the path forks into a road. Follow that road straight into Thelsamar. Give Mountaineer Kadrell this cask of Shimmer Stout and see what he thinks!Rejold's New Brew^10^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Tharek Blackstone^Rejold Barleybrew^Rejold's New Brew^The Perfect Stout^^Speak with Rejold Barleybrew.^Rejold Barleybrew at Brewnall Village has been asking for you. He wants to talk to you about a new drink he's been brewing...said something about you helping him with it. You might want to head back to Brewnall Village and see what he has to say. There could be some free booze in it for you...Rat Catching^11^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Kadrell^Mountaineer Kadrell^^^^Bring 12 Tunnel Rat Ears to Mountaineer Kadrell in Thelsamar.^We have a real infestation problem to the west. Tunnel rat kobolds have moved into the foothills, setting up dens and fouling our land with their filth! We want them eliminated. Hunt them, bring me their ears and earn their bounty. You can find tunnel rat kobolds and their dens west of Thelsamar, littered along the mountainside.A Pilot's Revenge^11^Alliance^Dun Morogh^A Dwarven Corpse^Pilot Hammerfoot^The Lost Pilot^^^Kill Mangeclaw.^Hildelve wrote in his journal that he was attacked by Mangeclaw, a "huge Ice Claw Bear." He drove off the beast, but not before it mauled him savagely. Judging from the state of Hildelve's body, Mangeclaw must have later returned and killed him. However, Hildelve wrote in his journal his one, final wish: Revenge against Mangeclaw.Thelsamar Blood Sausages^11^Alliance^Loch Modan^Vidra Hearthstove^Vidra Hearthstove^^^^Bring 3 pieces of Bear Meat, 3 Boar Intestines, and 3 Spider Ichor to Vidra Hearthstove in Thelsamar.^There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in Thelsamar, kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them? No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy <class>, you'll be any exception. I'll need bear meat, boar intestines for the casings, and spider ichor for spice. You get me some of those, and leave the cooking to Vidra!The Lost Pilot^10^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Pilot Hammerfoot^A Dwarven Corpse^The Lost Pilot^^^Find Pilot Hildelve.^My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, Mori Hildelve, is lost in the hills. We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it! Still convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot, searching. It's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls in the hills at night. Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried. Please, <name>. Find him.Senir's Observations^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Mountaineer Thalos^Senir Whitebeard^^Senir's Observations^Frostmane Hold^Deliver Grelin's report to Senir Whitebeard in Kharanos.^The troggs in the tunnel are extremely hostile, and haven't shown any hesitation in attacking travelers through the tunnel. You seem tough enough, though, so you should probably be safe. Directions? If you're going to speak with Senir, you'll find him in Kharanos. Make your way through the tunnel, and after you come out on the other side, just keep following the road, it'll run right into Kharanos.Prove Your Worth^10^All^Silverpine Forest^Dalar Dawnweaver^Dalar Dawnweaver^Prove Your Worth^^^Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher wants you to kill 5 Moonrage Whitescalps.^Lady Sylvanas has charged Varimathras with the conquering of the human and dwarven lands to the south. But that fool, Arugal -- charlatan of Dalaran and now cursed beast of Shadowfang Keep -- let his reckless magic wreak havoc with the strategic stronghold of Silverpine Forest. I need someone skilled in the ways of combat to help clean up Arugal's mess. Prove yourself to me by killing 5 Moonrage Whitescalps. The wretched beasts can often be found just off the road, down the hill below.Arugal's Folly^11^All^Silverpine Forest^Dalar Dawnweaver^Dalar Dawnweaver^Prove Your Worth^^^Retrieve the Remedy of Arugal for Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.^How Arugal gained acceptance within the Kirin Tor is beyond me. His spell-casting knowledge seemed as transparent as a blown glass bauble. What's important now is learning exactly what magic Arugal used so that I can turn it against him and secure Silverpine Forest for the Dark Lady. Arugal first stayed at the wheat farm just north of the bridge. One of the Deathstalkers reported seeing some spellbooks but could not secure them. Retrieve for me the spell labeled Remedy of Arugal from those books.Arugal's Folly^14^All^Silverpine Forest^Dalar Dawnweaver^Dalar Dawnweaver^Prove Your Worth^^^Bring 6 Glutton Shackles and 3 Darksoul Shackles to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.^After examining Arugal's work my worst suspicions were confirmed. The old hack was not qualified to clean chamber pots in Dalaran let alone represent the Kirin Tor in its most dire hour. Fools! Arugal used enchanted items to reinforce his weak magic. I need to examine these items first hand. Travel forth and slay Moonrage Gluttons and Moonrage Darksouls until you have collected enough of their enchanted shackles for my research. The foul creatures have been seen to the north and east.Arugal's Folly^15^All^Silverpine Forest^Dalar Dawnweaver^Dalar Dawnweaver^Prove Your Worth^^^Kill Grimson the Pale and bring his head to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.^It will indeed take me longer than I had thought to uncover the dark secrets behind the enchantments Arugal was using. But in the meantime I need you to take care of a slight problem our Darkstalkers have discovered. It seems that Arugal let his magic spread to the Deep Elem Mine in the hills to the southeast. The mine would prove to be quite a resource for Varimathras's advance. I want you to behead the tainted foreman of the mine, Grimson the Pale. With his death, the mine shall be ours.Ivar the Foul^12^All^Silverpine Forest^Rane Yorick^Rane Yorick^^Return to Quinn^^Kill Ivar the Foul, and bring Ivar's Head to Rane Yorick at the Ivar Patch.^My brother Quinn and I were tasked to recon Silverpine Forest and report to High Executor Hadrec. But we didn't get far -- when moving through this farm we were attacked by the ghoul Ivar the Foul. We escaped from Ivar, but he seriously mauled Quinn. He's healing from the potion you gave him, but Ivar may return before Quinn recovers. Kill Ivar so Quinn will have time to heal. Ivar is usually in the barn yonder, waiting for my guard to drop.The Mills Overrun^8^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Dillinger^Deathguard Dillinger^^A Putrid Task^^Gather 5 Notched Ribs and 3 Blackened Skulls, then return to Deathguard Dillinger in Brill.^The Scourge are trying to form a base at the Agamand Mills. If they do, then they can stage further attacks within Tirisfal. The orders have been given. The Scourge in the Mills must be destroyed. Go to the Mills. Collect Notched Ribs from Rattlecage and Cracked Skull Soldiers, and Blackened Skulls from Darkeye Bonecasters. To get to the Mills, follow the road west. After crossing the bridge, take the next fork north then keep going north. When you see windmills, the battle will begin.At War With The Scarlet Crusade^8^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Executor Zygand^Executor Zygand^At War With The Scarlet Crusade^Vital Intelligence^^Executor Zygand of Brill wants you to kill 10 Scarlet Warriors.^The documents Executor Arren provided are just the break we needed in our battle with the wretched Scarlet Crusade. We now know their exact locations throughout Tirisfal Glades. But the Deathguard has larger concerns. The Lich King's army grows in number each night. We need someone with "initiative" like yourself to drive the Scarlet Crusade to the grave. Prove to me you are capable of serving The Dark Lady by travelling west to the tower past the Solliden Farmstead and slay 10 Scarlet Warriors.Lost Deathstalkers^12^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^Rane Yorick^Lost Deathstalkers^^^Find the Deathstalkers Quinn and Rane Yorick.^A couple weeks ago two of our Deathstalkers, Rane and Quinn Yorick, were sent on a reconnaissance mission through northern Silverpine. We have not heard from them. They may have become victim to the Scourge, though if that is true then I want it confirmed. Find these Deathstalkers. Their first objective was to scout the farms in northern Silverpine. You should begin your search there.Wild Hearts^11^All^Silverpine Forest^Rane Yorick^Apothecary Renferrel^Lost Deathstalkers^^^Gather 6 discolored worg hearts and bring them to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher.^My brother Quinn was badly hurt by the ghoul, Ivar the Foul, and I don't know if he will heal properly without magical aid. Although I am not an apothecary, I do know that our apothecaries can make healing potions from the discolored hearts of worgs. Gather such hearts and take them to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher to the south. Then return here with the potion. You can find plenty of worgs between here and Malden's Orchard to the east.Return to Quinn^11^All^Silverpine Forest^Apothecary Renferrel^Quinn Yorick^Lost Deathstalkers^^Ivar the Foul^Bring Quinn's potion to Quinn Yorick at the Ivar Patch, north of the Sepulcher.^Here is the potion to aid in Quinn Yorick's recovery. Now if you will excuse me, I have very important work to continue...Those Blasted Troggs!^9^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Foreman Stonebrow^Foreman Stonebrow^^^^Kill 6 Rockjaw Skullthumpers for Foreman Stonebrow at the Gol'Bolar quarry.^Those Light-blasted troggs, turning my work site into a wreck! Look at that, there goes another barrel of powder! Ohhh, I wish I could go down there and wring every one of their scrawny little necks! I want to kill them all! This can't be good for my health, all this stress and anger... What have they left me with? Nothing! I'd kill them myself, but my aim's no good anymore! You go into the quarry and kill some of the filthy buggers! I'll pay you! Just hurt them, kill them!The Public Servant^11^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Senator Mehr Stonehallow^Senator Mehr Stonehallow^^^^Kill 10 Rockjaw Bonesnappers for Senator Mehr Stonehallow at the Gol'Bolar quarry.^As a member of the Senate and the Explorers' League, I've taken it upon myself to take care of this part of the trogg infestation that has gripped our lands. They've certainly made a mess of Gol'Bolar quarry, and for no reason. As we dug deep into the earth, they poured out, destroying our equipment and driving the miners out. There's not much for us to do but to exterminate the lot of them, rebuild, then get back to work. If you help me with the troggs, I'll gladly recompense you for your time.The Attack!^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Tyrion^Elling Trias^The Attack!^Items of Some Consequence^^Remain in the garden until Lord Gregor Lescovar and Marzon the Silent Blade have had their conversation. Afterwards, kill them both before returning to Elling Trias in Stormwind.^After I put on Spybot's disguise, he'll head in to talk to Lescovar. The guards should let him pass no problem. While you were getting materials for me, I took care of informing Marzon that it was time for him and Lescovar to meet again. I even dropped some false information. Lescovar will dismiss his guards and wait for Marzon out here in the garden. After you catch wind of talk about the Defias, make your move. You need to kill them both before the guards return! When you're done, speak to Trias.Escorting Erland^11^All^Silverpine Forest^Deathstalker Erland^Rane Yorick^Escorting Erland^^^Escort Erland through the wolves, to Rane Yorick.^The wolves outside won't leave, and they eye me evilly every time I step foot out that door. They must be incredibly hungry to think I'm worth eating. I have to report to my teammate, the Deathstalker Rane Yorick. And to get to Rane, I'll need help against those wolves. Please escort me! And there are a lot of wolves out there, so we'll have a better chance if you have friends who can help...Ironband's Excavation^18^Alliance^Loch Modan^Jern Hornhelm^Magmar Fellhew^Ironband's Excavation^^^Speak with Explorer Fellhew.^Prospector Ironband is heading an excavation of ancient ruins east of the lake. His progress has been slow lately, especially considering all the supplies we've sent him. Ironband's a stout, honest dwarf who values results, which has me worried that forces are at work against him. Go to Ironband's Excavation and speak with Magmar Fellhew. He manages the details of the site and will know why there's a slowdown. To get to the excavation site, go around the southern tip of the lake, then head east.The Dead Fields^14^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^High Executor Hadrec^The Dead Fields^^^Kill rot hide gnolls at the Dead Fields.^Our initial scouting reports of Silverpine show the rot hides have a base at an old farm to the north, the Dead Fields. We have sent small assaults against them, but each time they are reinforced by the banshee Nightlash, who uses her magic to rout our forces. We want Nightlash destroyed. Go to the Dead Fields and assault the rot hides. If you don't see Nightlash then kill the rot hides until she appears, then defeat her. Her essence will turn to dust. Bring me that dust as proof.The Decrepit Ferry^16^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^Corpse Laden Boat^The Dead Fields^^Rot Hide Ichor^Go to the Decrepit Ferry.^<name>, we've discovered a new hive for the Scourge: the Decrepit Ferry. The ferry lies east of the Sepulcher, and is heavily patrolled by rot hides and other undead. There must be a reason for the Scourge's occupation of the area. Go to the Decrepit Ferry and find out why the Scourge are there.Rot Hide Clues^16^Horde^Silverpine Forest^Corpse Laden Boat^High Executor Hadrec^The Dead Fields^^The Engraved Ring^Bring Deliah's Ring to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher.^Among the corpses a hand protrudes, unwrapped. It is the hand of a woman, pockmarked from the plague but relatively fresh. On the hand is a ring. Removing the ring and inspecting it reveals an engraving: "For Deliah"The Engraved Ring^16^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^Magistrate Sevren^The Engraved Ring^Rot Hide Clues^^Bring Deliah's Ring to Magistrate Sevren in Brill.^If you want to find the husband or beloved who gave Deliah her ring... then speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill. He should have records of recent deaths and, with luck, can discover who Deliah is. But I wouldn't hope. Whoever gave her the ring is probably dead. Or if he's undead he probably no longer cares about Deliah.Raleigh and the Undercity^16^All^Silverpine Forest^Magistrate Sevren^Raleigh Andrean^The Engraved Ring^^^Bring Deliah's Ring to Raleigh.^Deliah had a husband, Raleigh, who now dwells in the Undercity. If the Deliah who lived in Brill is the one who owned this ring, then Raleigh will know. Raleigh is in the Trade Quarter of the Undercity.Assault on Fenris Isle^20^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^High Executor Hadrec^Thule Ravenclaw^^^Bring Thule's Head to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher.^Now is the time to assault the Scourge's place of strength in Silverpine: Fenris Isle. You must again go to the Isle and destroy Thule Ravenclaw. I want his head! This mission is as dangerous as it is vital, <name>. You must not fail.Rot Hide Ichor^17^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^Apothecary Renferrel^The Dead Fields^The Decrepit Ferry^^Bring 8 bottles of rot hide ichor to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher.^Before we launch an assault on Fenris Isle, we must determine who is behind the rot hide gnolls. Our apothecaries believe their origin lies within the strange fluid that flows through their bodies. Go to Fenris Isle, east of the Decrepit Ferry, and collect rot hide ichor from the gnolls you find there. Bring it to Apothecary Renferrel, stationed outside the Sepulcher.Rot Hide Origins^17^All^Silverpine Forest^Apothecary Renferrel^Bethor Iceshard^The Dead Fields^^Thule Ravenclaw^Bring the Sample Ichor to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity.^I have reduced the ichor you brought me and separated it into its base components. My findings are not conclusive, but I have determined that warlock and necromantic magics were used in the ichor's creation. While I continue to study the ichor, I want you to take a sample to Bethor Iceshard in the Undercity. Bethor is not an apothecary, but his knowledge of magic may help to unravel the mystery of the rot hides. Go. You will find Bethor in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity.Delivery to Silverpine Forest^10^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Apothecary Johaan^Apothecary Renferrel^^^^Take Apothecary Johaan's findings to Apothecary Renferrel in Silverpine Forest.^Time is a luxury that is not afforded to those of us under the employ of Lady Sylvanas. Surely you know this by now. As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society it is my duty to share my knowledge with my colleagues so that our collective efforts might one day provide The Dark Lady with the New Plague she so badly desires. Take these findings to Apothecary Renferrel who is stationed at The Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest. Follow the roads to the south from Brill. From the Undercity go southwest.Thule Ravenclaw^16^All^Silverpine Forest^Bethor Iceshard^Apothecary Renferrel^Thule Ravenclaw^Rot Hide Origins^^Bring Bethor's Scroll to Apothecary Renferrel at the Silverpine Sepulcher.^This Ichor was crafted by an old colleague of mine: Thule Ravenclaw. He was a young, promising mage before the great war, but when the Lich King rose to power, he betrayed his brethren and allied with the Scourge. I did not realize he still lives, nor that he leads the Rot Hides in their forays against us! I know many of his spells, and can help concoct a potion to counter them. Take this scroll back to Apothecary Renferrel. It has the incantations needed for the potion.A Recipe For Death^12^All^Silverpine Forest^Apothecary Renferrel^Master Apothecary Faranell^A Recipe For Death^^^Collect 6 Grizzled Bear Hearts and 6 samples of Skittering Blood and deliver them to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.^Arthas's numbers are overwhelming. But with a New Plague we could eradicate both the Scourge Army and the Human infestation once and for all. My studies have proven that spider blood combined with a toxin derived from a grizzled bear heart results in a deadly elixir. Collect samples from the spiders in the Skittering Dark to the northwest and from the bears wandering throughout Silverpine Forest. Deliver the reagents to Master Apothecary Faranell of the Royal Apothecary Society in the Undercity.Report to Hadrec^16^All^Silverpine Forest^Apothecary Renferrel^High Executor Hadrec^Thule Ravenclaw^^^Report to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher.^Before you launch an assault on Fenris Isle, report to High Executor Hadrec. He may have additional information or equipment you'll need.The Deathstalkers' Report^11^All^Silverpine Forest^Rane Yorick^High Executor Hadrec^Escorting Erland^^^Bring the Deathstalker Report to High Executor Hadrec at the Sepulcher.^Although Quinn's wounds are mending, I want to get our report to High Executor Hadrec as quickly as possible. It has information that is vital to the Forsaken's occupation of Silverpine.A Recipe For Death^15^All^Silverpine Forest^Master Apothecary Faranell^Apothecary Renferrel^A Recipe For Death^^^Retrieve Apothecary Berard's journal from Pyrewood Village and take it to Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher.^You can be of further service to the Royal Apothecary Society, <name>. When Arugal cast his wretched magic on the forest, he cursed one of our most promising members, Apothecary Berard. Now a mindless servant of Arugal, Berard is useless to us. But his findings might prove to be of worth. He was studying an ancient plague that killed off all the aquatic life in Lake Lordamere ages ago. Retrieve Berard's Journal from his study in the Pyrewood Village Inn and take it to Apothecary Renferrel.A Recipe For Death^18^All^Silverpine Forest^Apothecary Renferrel^Master Apothecary Faranell^A Recipe For Death^^^Bring 6 samples of Lake Creeper Moss, 6 samples of Lake Skulker Moss and a Hardened Tumor to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.^According to Berard's Journal the moss from Lake Skulkers and Creepers might prove useful for our quest to brew a new plague. Those beasts dwell on the islands in Lake Lordamere to the east. He also mentions a very rare Hardened Tumor that he discovered on a Vile Fin murloc. Apparently the tumor is so rare Berard was only able to obtain one. Collect samples of the moss as well as the rare hardened tumor and take them to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.Pyrewood Ambush^15^All^Silverpine Forest^Deathstalker Faerleia^Deathstalker Faerleia^^^^Help Deathstalker Faerleia kill the Pyrewood Council.^You got here just in the nick of time, <name>! The Pyrewood Council will be returning any moment. Arugal has other matters to tend to in the keep. He uses the Council as mere puppets to keep the mindless minions of Pyrewood under his control. But I believe that without the guidance of the Pyrewood Council, the sons of Arugal will turn against their master. I cannot handle them all by myself. I need you to help me. Together we can lay waste to the Council for Lady Sylvanas.Finding the Shadowy Figure^25^Alliance^Duskwood^Tavernkeep Smitts^Jitters^Sven's Revenge^^^Find the Shadowy Figure. Your clues:^Good luck, <name>. I hope you find the chap, and I hope you find him alive. If he's left the safety of Darkshire then he could be prey to the beasts of the wilds.After the Ambush^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Huldar^Miran^Excavation Progress Report^^Protecting the Shipment^Speak with Miran.^We'd been hauling the barrels of powder back and forth in trips before this... business. Now we have to split up the work, Miran's taking the barrels and I'm watching over the other ones. I don't feel safe letting Miran haul the rest of the shipment by himself. When he's ready to go, maybe you could escort him on his next trip?The Algaz Gauntlet^21^Alliance^Wetlands^Mountaineer Rockgar^Valstag Ironjaw^Report to Mountaineer Rockgar^^^Traverse Dun Algaz.^Orcs of the Dragonmaw clan have a haven in the Wetlands. And now they have expanded into Dun Algaz! We can't let them keep their foothold here or Loch Modan will be cut off from Menethil Harbor, our port and stronghold in the Wetlands. Break through Dun Algaz to the Wetlands beyond, and kill some orcs for good measure! Report to Valstag Ironjaw in Menethil Harbor. Menethil is through Dun Algaz, then north along the road, then west at the fork. We're counting on you, <name>. Do not fail.The Balance of Nature^2^All^Teldrassil^Conservator Ilthalaine^Conservator Ilthalaine^^^The Balance of Nature, Simple Sigil, Etched Sigil, Encrypted Sigil, Hallowed Sigil, Verdant Sigil^Kill 4 Young Nightsabers and 4 Young Thistle Boars and return to Conservator Ilthalaine.^Greetings, <name>. I am Conservator Ilthalaine. My purpose in Shadowglen is to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained. The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber and thistle boar populations grew too large. Shadowglen can only produce so much food for the beasts. Journey forth, young <class>, and thin the boar and saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved.The Balance of Nature^3^All^Teldrassil^Conservator Ilthalaine^Conservator Ilthalaine^^The Balance of Nature^^Conservator Ilthalaine needs you to kill 5 Mangy Nightsabers and 5 Thistle Boars.^Thinning the younger population of creatures here in Shadowglen was a good start, <name>, but there is still work to be done. The resources of the forest will be depleted too quickly if the problem is not addressed. Killing nature's beasts is a necessary evil for the good of all who share the land. Venture into the forest and slay mangy nightsabers and thistle boars in the name of balance.The Woodland Protector^1^All^Teldrassil^Melithar Staghelm^Tarindrella^The Woodland Protector^^^Seek out the dryad known as Tarindrella.^Thank goodness you are here, <class>. Strange news has traveled to me through the whisperings of the forest spirits. The mysterious woodland protector, Tarindrella, has returned to Shadowglen. The dryad's presence has not been felt in the forests of Kalimdor in years. Something is surely amiss if she has journeyed back to this land. Seek out Tarindrella and see what business she tends to in our grove. One of the Sentinels reported seeing her to the southwest of Aldrassil.The Woodland Protector^3^All^Teldrassil^Tarindrella^Tarindrella^The Woodland Protector^^^Collect 8 Fel Moss and bring them to Tarindrella.^Something evil is brewing in the forests of Teldrassil. Look long the hills to where the peaceful furbolgs used to dwell. They have deserted their homes and are amassing under the name of the Gnarlpine tribe. Only the corruption of wicked Fel Moss could cause such a transformation. The grells and grellkin have infested the area and are threatening the residents of Shadowglen. Engage these grells and grellkin, <name>, and see if they are indeed caught under the enchantment of the wicked Fel Moss.Resting in Pieces^17^All^Silverpine Forest^A Talking Head^Shallow Grave^Resting in Pieces^^^Bring Alaric's Head to his grave.^You don't look like a rot hide. Good. I had lost hope... My name is Alaric, and I was once Thule's head servant and bodyguard. He used his magic to "protect" me from the Plague of Undeath, but instead his spell gave me an unlife from which I cannot escape. And after creating the cursed rot hide gnolls, Thule beheaded me... and gave my head to the gnolls as a plaything! Please, take me to my body. I believe the gnolls buried it here in Fenris Keep, near the stable, in an unmarked grave.The Hidden Niche^18^All^Silverpine Forest^Shallow Grave^Dusty Shelf^Resting in Pieces^^^Take Alaric to the hidden alcove.^I know of a hidden niche within the keep that holds an item dear to Thule, and his old colleagues. It also holds something you might find useful. Take me there! The alcove is in the southwestern tower of the keep, behind a dusty shelf. Take my body, but leave my boots. They never fit me anyway...The Greenwarden^21^Alliance^Wetlands^First Mate Fitzsimmons^Rethiel the Greenwarden^The Greenwarden^^^Find the Greenwarden.^You've heard of the Greenwarden? You're not looking for him, are you? Well I say you're crazy if you are, but who am I to keep a fool from <his/her> death? If you are seeking that beast, then I hear he is in the marsh, east of the road where it forks to Dun Modr. He's lurking there among the crocs...and worse! And leave your money here. You won't need it where you're going...and you don't want to chip ol' Greenie's tooth on your gold when he bites you in half, do you?War Banners^26^Alliance^Wetlands^Captain Stoutfist^Captain Stoutfist^Report to Captain Stoutfist^^^Bring 8 Dragonmaw War Banners to Captain Stoutfist.^The Dragonmaw orc clan was all but destroyed by the end of the Second War, after they lost control of their red dragon pets. The dragons were not very happy with their old masters, and fiercely hunted the Dragonmaws. What few remained fled from Grim Batol and into the Mountains east of Whelgar's Excavation. Now they've gained strength, and have an encampment northeast of Menethil. We want you to attack that encampment. Gather and bring me their war banners as proof.Nek'rosh's Gambit^26^Alliance^Wetlands^Captain Stoutfist^Dragonmaw Catapult^Report to Captain Stoutfist^^^Destroy the Dragonmaw catapults.^While you were fighting the Dragonmaws, we discovered more of their plans. Nek'rosh has built catapults and aims to lay siege to Menethil! And with the fighting in Dun Algaz, we're effectively blocked from reinforcements! You need to take out those catapults. They're in the Dragonmaw encampment. Here, take this tinder. Fight your way to the catapults and light them with the tinder. And after you've done that, find and kill Nek'rosh. We need to cut this Dragonmaw beast down...at its neck.Search for Incendicite^22^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Pilot Stonegear^Pilot Stonegear^Stonegear's Search^^^Bring 6 loads of Incendicite Ore to Pilot Stonegear in Dun Morogh.^I heard that a rare ore, incendicite, was found in the Wetlands, in a cave northwest of Algaz Gate. Incendicite is volatile stuff and hard to use without blowing yourself up, but I'm sure if it's smelted the right way it could make cannon shells that pack a mighty punch! Get me incendicite ore and I'll find someone brave enough to experiment with it. Oh, and to extract that ore from a vein you'll need skill in mining. If you don't have it, then ... bring a friend who does to that cave!Stonegear's Search^23^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Mountaineer Kadrell^Pilot Stonegear^Stonegear's Search^^^Speak with Pilot Stonegear.^Pilot Stonegear loves his siege engine, as every pilot should! And he's always eager to find new ways to improve his tank's firepower! He heard rumors of a rare ore and is looking for someone to hunt it down for him. If your boots are starting to itch, then find Stonegear at Steelgrill's Depot in Dun Morogh and see what he wants.Report to Mountaineer Rockgar^21^Alliance^Wetlands^Mountaineer Kadrell^Mountaineer Rockgar^Report to Mountaineer Rockgar^^^Speak with Mountaineer Rockgar.^Mountaineer Rockgar is looking for volunteers for a mission through Dun Algaz and into the Wetlands. If you want to get your boots wet in that soggy county to the north, then speak with Rockgar at Dun Algaz. Dun Algaz is north up the road, beyond the guard tower.Daily Delivery^21^Alliance^Wetlands^Einar Stonegrip^James Halloran^^^^Deliver the Bundle of Crocolisk Skins to James Halloran, the tanner, in Menethil Harbor.^Greetings, traveler! Don't suppose you might be heading in the direction of Menethil, would you? If you're not, I'd suggest you stop there, it's a good place to purchase goods and even have a pint and relax. Now, if it just so happens that you're heading in that direction, I don't suppose you'd mind taking this bundle of crocolisk skins to James Halloran, the tanner? I'd do it myself, but my wife's been in quite a mood lately, and I'd like to put off facing her as long as possible.Digging Through the Ooze^24^Alliance^Wetlands^Sida^Sida^^^^One of the oozes at Ironbeard's Tomb has Sida's bag, retrieve it and bring it back to her in Menethil Harbor.^On my weekly visit to Ironbeard's Tomb I was attacked by dreadful, dripping oozes! Naturally, I panicked. I threw my bag at one, but it didn't do anything! The ooze just sucked it right up... Luckily, it did give me enough time to get away. The bad news is that I really need to get the contents of my bag! I don't know which ooze I threw my bag at; they all looked the same! Ironbeard's Tomb is northeast of here, near Dun Modr. Thank you so much!Apprentice's Duties^26^Alliance^Wetlands^James Halloran^James Halloran^Young Crocolisk Skins^^^Collect 6 Giant Crocolisk Skins and bring them to James Halloran in Menethil Harbor.^I sent my apprentice out into the marshes to skin some of our famous giant Wetlands crocolisks. When he didn't return, I went out to look for him... Let's just say it wasn't a pretty sight. Midwife says he might pull through, but in the meantime I still need my skins! ...If you'd like to kill a few more of the brutes, I wouldn't be opposed, after what they did. You'll find the crocs north up the coast, beyond the murloc hovels.Fall of Dun Modr^25^Alliance^Wetlands^Harlo Barnaby^Longbraid the Grim^^^^Search for Longbraid near the town of Dun Modr.^Dun Modr has fallen to the Dark Iron Dwarves! My wounds are grave, <class>. Most of the regiment was killed! The Dark Iron thugs attacked us before we could regroup from the Thandol Span ambush. Our leader, Longbraid, sounded the retreat horn. As we left the town I was hit by a stray axe in the back. All went black. I awoke here in Menethil but I fear for my fellow soldiers. Hope still burns within me. Perhaps Longbraid is still alive! See if you can find him near Dun Modr, <race>!Report to Captain Stoutfist^26^Alliance^Wetlands^Valstag Ironjaw^Captain Stoutfist^Report to Captain Stoutfist^^^Speak with Captain Stoutfist.^<name>. The Dragonmaw orc clan is showing its strength in more than just Algaz. Captain Stoutfist has asked to speak with those willing to offer aid against these orcs. He is inside the keep, in the war room.Defeat Nek'rosh^26^Alliance^Wetlands^Dragonmaw Catapult^Captain Stoutfist^Report to Captain Stoutfist^^^Kill Chieftain Nek'rosh^Now that the catapults have been burned, find and kill Chieftain Nek'rosh.A Troubling Breeze^6^Alliance^Teldrassil^Athridas Bearmantle^Gaerolas Talvethren^A Troubling Breeze^^^Seek out Gaerolas Talvethren in Starbreeze Village.^A troubling breeze blows through the forest. Gaerolas Talvethren serves as Great Warden to the hibernating Druids of the Talon in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. His duty as the chosen protector of the Sleeping is to ensure their safety so that their pact with Ysera remains fulfilled. But word from Gaerolas is now delayed and I grow nervous. Travel east to Starbreeze Village and bring back a report from Gaerolas so that I can put my worries to rest, knowing my dreaming brethren slumber safely.Gnarlpine Corruption^6^All^Teldrassil^Gaerolas Talvethren^Athridas Bearmantle^A Troubling Breeze^^^Return to Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar.^The Gnarlpine tribe has been corrupted! The once peaceful furbolgs have turned against the protectors of the forest. They ambushed me as I left for the Ban'ethil Barrow Den and proceeded to pillage Starbreeze Village. Ursal the Mauler, their chieftain, is using the evil powers of the Fel Moss to drive them mad. I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news. The task is left to you, young <class>. We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet!Border Crossings^14^All^Silverpine Forest^Shadow Priest Allister^Dalaran Crate^Border Crossings^^^Retrieve the contents of one of the Dalaran wizards' crates. You will find Pyrewood Village to the south.^As you may know, the town of Ambermill remains a source of human opposition, mainly through the support they receive from the wizards of Dalaran. I don't know what their plan is, but for them to show interest in a backwater village like Ambermill indicates that it must have some greater importance. They've been shipping crates by the wagon from Hillsbrad. Many of those supplies end up at a small camp north of Pyrewood Village. Retrieve the contents of a crate and return them to me.Maps and Runes^14^All^Silverpine Forest^Dalaran Crate^Shadow Priest Allister^Border Crossings^^^Bring the strange pendant to Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher.^<You quickly remove the pendant from the crate and replace the lid.>Ambermill Investigations^16^All^Silverpine Forest^Shadow Priest Allister^Shadow Priest Allister^Border Crossings^^^Obtain 8 Dalaran Pendants for Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher.^Dalar is attempting to locate the source of the wizards' spellcasting. For now, we'll have to slow their progress in any way we can... The conjurers, mages and protectors are no doubt carrying the pendants. Remove and retrieve them. Take the main road south and the eastern fork into Ambermill.The Weaver^22^All^Silverpine Forest^Shadow Priest Allister^Shadow Priest Allister^Border Crossings^^^Kill the Dalaran archmage, then retrieve his staff for Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher.^An archmage of great power is overseeing the reactivation of the ley energy node. With the progress they have made, our only hope of stopping them is by killing him. It will be difficult, he is no doubt protected by many other mages and warders. You must go, and you must dispatch him quickly. When he is dead, retrieve his staff for me. Go now.Dalar's Analysis^14^All^Silverpine Forest^Shadow Priest Allister^Dalar Dawnweaver^Border Crossings^^^Take the rune-inscribed pendant to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.^Take the pendant to Dalar Dawnweaver, perhaps he can shed some light on the wizards' plans.Dalaran's Intentions^14^All^Silverpine Forest^Dalar Dawnweaver^Shadow Priest Allister^Border Crossings^^^Speak with Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher.^Of course! How could I have forgotten? Ambermill was one of the sites earmarked by the Kirin Tor, noted because it houses a dormant ley energy node. The wizards must be planning to reactivate the node and use its energies for some greater purpose. We cannot allow this to happen... It will take a great amount of power to activate the area's ley energies, we can stall them by taking the pendants away from the wizards. Relay this information to Allister, he will decide a course of action.The Relics of Wakening^9^All^Teldrassil^Athridas Bearmantle^Athridas Bearmantle^A Troubling Breeze^^^Retrieve the Relics of Wakening and bring them to Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar.^Gnarlpine invaders were seen ravaging the Ban'ethil Barrow Den to the west. The slumbering druids will be trapped in the Emerald Dream for eternity, unaware of their fate, unless we help. The delicate hibernation ritual cannot be broken without the Relics of Wakening. Journey to the Den and retrieve the Raven Claw Talisman, Black Feather Quill, Sapphire of Sky, and Rune of Nesting. The druids store them in sacred chests. Return them to me and I will prepare the awakening ritual.Young Crocolisk Skins^22^Alliance^Wetlands^James Halloran^James Halloran^Young Crocolisk Skins^^^Obtain 4 Young Crocolisk Skins for James Halloran in Menethil Harbor.^I'm James Halloran, the tanner. My cured crocolisk skins are sought after all over, shipments leaving by boat to ports around the world. Met Einar? He's one of the hunters that brings crocolisk skins in for me. I'm a bit short on the softer skins that come off crocolisk young. Being that I'm running low, I'll pay you top coin for a stack of the skins. You can find the young crocs in the marshes right outside of town.Find OOX-09/HL!^48^All^The Hinterlands^OOX-09/HL Distress Beacon^Homing Robot OOX-09/HL^Find OOX-09/HL!^^^Take the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot at the head of the river in the Hinterlands, near Skulk Rock.^You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal. Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption! A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life. "My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed! I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!" "I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it crashed at the head of the river near Skulk Rock!"Ursal the Mauler^12^All^Teldrassil^Athridas Bearmantle^Athridas Bearmantle^A Troubling Breeze^^^Kill Ursal the Mauler and return to Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar.^Now the time has come to save the Druids of the Talon. If we fail now, <name>, they will be forever lost in sleep. I shall prepare the Relics of Wakening and perform the ritual. For my work to take effect, the cursed beast responsible for this horrible situation must be slain. Only then will the ritual be complete. It was Ursal the Mauler who meddled with our brethren's calling and it is Ursal the Mauler who must now pay so they can be freed. Travel to Gnarlpine Hold in the southwest and slay him.The Road to Darnassus^8^All^Teldrassil^Moon Priestess Amara^Moon Priestess Amara^^^^Slay 6 Gnarlpine Ambushers and return to Sentinel Amara Nightwalker outside of Dolanaar.^The road to Darnassus must be kept safe. Travelers heading from Dolanaar to Darnassus have been reporting ruthless attacks by corrupted furbolgs from the Gnarlpine tribe. Important news and commerce travels to and from Darnassus by way of this road daily. We cannot afford to have a rogue band of heathens terrorizing people. Take up arms in the name of the sacred forest, <class>. Their den lies somewhere below this vantage point. Slay 6 of these Gnarlpine ambushers and report back to me.Zenn's Bidding^5^All^Teldrassil^Zenn Foulhoof^Zenn Foulhoof^^^Seek Redemption!^Bring Zenn Foulhoof outside of Dolanaar 3 Nightsaber Fangs, 3 Strigid Owl Feathers and 3 swatches of Webwood Spider Silk.^Eager for work, I see. Lucky for you a day never goes by that I don't wish I had a fledgling <class> to perform my bidding. You see, <name>, I can make you very happy and provide you with things you never dreamed of having. But in order for that to happen you must bring me certain items. My business in the forest often requires certain. . .reagents. Fetch for me 3 Nightsaber Fangs, 3 Strigid Owl Feathers and 3 swatches of Webwood Spider Silk. Let's keep this our little secret, <race>.Seek Redemption!^7^All^Teldrassil^Sentinel Kyra Starsong^Zenn Foulhoof^^Zenn's Bidding^^Collect 3 Fel Cones and give them to Zenn Foulhoof outside of Dolanaar.^The Council of the Forest has news that you aided Zenn Foulhoof. The satyr is an enemy of the forest. As a <race>, you should know better than to defile the forest by killing Nature's creatures. You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of Teldrassil. Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. Fel Cones are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke. Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack.Wand to Bethor^18^All^Silverpine Forest^Dusty Shelf^Bethor Iceshard^Resting in Pieces^^^Take the Woven Wand to Bethor Iceshard in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity.^Thule once told me that, long ago, he and two colleagues created a magic wand, woven together from the apprentice wands each mage possessed. This wand was a symbol of their friendship, and although Thule came to despise it he could not part with it, nor could he let the others have it. So he stole the wand, and hid it in Fenris Keep. Here. Take the wand to Bethor Iceshard, one of Thule's friends from years past. I'm sure he will want it.A New Plague^11^All^Tirisfal Glades^Apothecary Johaan^Captured Mountaineer^A New Plague^^^Bring Johaan's Special Drink to the Captured Mountaineer.^According to the Deathguard, another one of those foolish Dwarven Mountaineers has just been captured. The Deathguard likes to use the cellar of the Gallows End Tavern as a holding cell until prisoners can be "properly" dealt with. Why don't you go see how the Captured Mountaineer enjoys this special drink I made for him? It contains a subtle hint of what The Dark Lady has planned for the rest of Azeroth.Journey to Hillsbrad Foothills^20^All^Silverpine Forest^Apothecary Renferrel^Apothecary Lydon^^^^Deliver Apothecary Renferrel's findings to Apothecary Lydon in the town of Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills.^The Royal Apothecary Society is under extreme pressure from the Dark Lady to develop a New Plague. We are working diligently and have made much progress. It is our belief that the success will be achieved much faster if we share information amongst the Society. For that reason I want you to deliver my latest findings to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill, a small town nestled in the Hillsbrad Foothills. The journey will be a long one. Head south and stick to the roads. Follow the signs closely!Time To Strike^20^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Deathstalker Lesh^High Executor Darthalia^^^^Travel to Tarren Mill to deliver Deathstalker Lesh's message to High Executor Darthalia.^Be silent and pay attention, <class>. I was sent to this position in order to survey the town of Hillsbrad. My mission is one of reconnaissance. It is imperative that you send word to High Executor Darthalia in Tarren Mill at once. Let her know that I, Deathstalker Lesh, send the following message: "The raven's cry from the west doth beckon." Follow the road to the east and pay close attention to the signs. Now, hurry! Off you go to Tarren Mill, and with urgency I might add!The Crown of Will^39^Horde^Undercity^Sharlindra^Melisara^The Crown of Will^^^Report to Melisara at Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills.^Mug'Thol and his ogre warband was sent to Alterac to retrieve the Crown of Will for Lady Sylvanas. Unfortunately, instead of returning it, the idiot decided to try it on... I suppose ogres can't resist anything bright and shiny. His bumbling actions have become something of a problem, however. The Crown of Will enabled him to resist the possession placed upon him to serve Lady Sylvanas. The Dark Lady wants an example made, travel to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad and report to Melisara, my lieutenant.Elixir of Suffering^22^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Lydon^Elixir of Suffering^^^Apothecary Lydon of Tarren Mill wants 10 Gray Bear Tongues and some Creeper Ichor.^Ah, another wretched day in Tarren Mill. All of this clean air puts me in such a foul mood, <name>. The sooner we can plague the humans here, the better. I've been conducting intense studies on possible killing agents to use in my concoctions but I haven't the time to collect them all. If you want to make yourself of use, procure the following items for me: 10 Gray Bear Tongues and the very rare and hard to find, Creeper Ichor. You'll find both bears and creepers just outside of Tarren Mill.The Rescue^22^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Krusk^Krusk^^^^Krusk in Tarren Mill needs you to free Drull and Tog'thar from Durnholde Keep.^Me and some other warriors were sent by the Warchief to retrieve an object from Durnholde and to investigate this so-called Syndicate. We went to Durnholde to take a look around, but we were taken by surprise by a large number of the humans. We fought bravely, but their sheer numbers were enough to defeat us. They took a few of us captive, but I was able to escape. Durnholde is just southeast of here, across the river. Drull and Tog'thar are being held there, you must go and rescue them.Elixir of Suffering^22^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Umpi^Elixir of Suffering^^Elixir of Pain^Give Umpi the Elixir of Suffering.^It will take but a moment for me to mix these components into what I have deemed an Elixir of Suffering. There we go! Ah, nothing brightens a gloomy day in these miserable foothills like bringing a little suffering into the world. Let us see if our little potion has achieved its desired effect. Give my assistant Umpi a taste of what the Dark Lady has planned for both humans and Scourge alike.Crushridge Bounty^36^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Marshal Redpath^Marshal Redpath^Crushridge Bounty^^^Gather 9 Dirty Knucklebones from Crushridge ogres in the Alterac Mountains. Bring them to Marshal Redpath in Southshore.^Crushridge ogres have dug an ogre mound up in the Alterac Mountains near the ruined city of Alterac. And my scouts tell me they've taken over those ruins as well. We can't let them get cozy up there; if they think they're safe where they are, then their next step will be to move down into the foothills, which will put them right at our front door! Go north to the Alterac Mountains and hunt ogres. Bring me the Dirty Knucklebones they carry and you will earn a nice bounty.Elixir of Pain^24^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Lydon^Elixir of Pain^Elixir of Suffering^^Bring 10 vials of Mountain Lion Blood to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^Oh, <name>. . .the flowers are blooming in Hillsbrad and the air is so fresh and brisk. I can't help but to wallow in the misery of it all. I look out my grimy window and long for the day when our New Plague brings this world the death it deserves. As much as I would love to sit and brood all day, my duty to the Dark Lady calls. Help me, would you? My research leads me to believe I can make the most splendid death-brew with the blood of a Mountain Lion. Bring some to me and we'll have a little fun.Elixir of Pain^24^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Stanley^Elixir of Pain^^Elixir of Agony^Feed the Elixir of Pain to Stanley.^Ah, nothing like the smell of fresh blood in the foothills! Now we'll mix in a touch of this and a little of that and let the real fun begin! What I have created with this blood, I like to call an Elixir of Pain. If my calculations are correct this concoction could be the start of something very beautiful for Lady Sylvanas. But what we need is a test. Take this elixir out to the northern farm in Hillsbrad Fields to the southwest. Let's see how Farmer Ray's little dog Stanley likes this "treat."Gol'dir^36^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Krusk^Gol'dir^Infiltration^^^Free Gol'dir then return to Krusk in Tarren Mill.^From what I can tell of the documents you procured, Gol'dir is being held in a large Syndicate base to the north, most likely in the Alterac Mountains. He has been held captive far too long and must be freed.Crushridge Warmongers^40^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Marshal Redpath^Marshal Redpath^Crushridge Bounty^^^Slay 10 Crushridge Warmongers, then return to Marshal Redpath in Southshore.^Now that you've had a taste of the Crushridge ogres, I want you to really bloody their noses... Go into the Ruins of Alterac and seek out the Crushridge Warmongers. I want you to cut down a good number of them - that's the only way those brutes will learn to keep their distance from Alliance territory.Syndicate Assassins^33^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Magistrate Henry Maleb^^^^Kill 12 Syndicate Footpads and 8 Syndicate Thieves, then return to Magistrate Henry Maleb in Southshore.^I am the new magistrate of Southshore, recently assigned after the assassination of the previous magistrate. The assassins were never found, but through our investigations we're almost certain they were hired by the Syndicate - a group of thieves led by villainous nobles of the now fallen kingdom of Alterac. The Syndicate has a camps in Sofera's Naze and Corahn's Dagger, north and west of the Horde-occupied Tarren Mill. Slay the Syndicate members you find in these camps.Blackmoore's Legacy^36^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Gol'dir^Krusk^Infiltration^^^Return the information gathered by Gol'dir to Krusk in Tarren Mill.^A day or two ago, I was visited by the leader of this Syndicate. His name was Aliden Perenolde, and styled himself lord of this land. He confided in me his plans to take the orcs that stood against him as slaves, just as his father and his mentor, the despised Blackmoore, had planned. More important was that he brought his mistress, a wisp of a girl named Elysa. Around her neck was the pendant the Warchief desires. Now go, I will make my own way, after I have settled my business here.Lord Aliden Perenolde^42^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Krusk^Elysa^Infiltration^^^Kill Lord Aliden Perenolde and ask his mistress, Elysa, about Taretha's pendant.^It is clear that Perenolde must be killed, his foulness removed from the world. His manor lies a ways to the north of here, on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Do your duty, <name>, then retrieve the pendant that the Warchief desires, and return here.Taretha's Gift^40^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Elysa^Krusk^Infiltration^^^Return Taretha's pendant to Krusk at Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad Foothills.^The pendant? Of course you can have it... Take it! I want no memory of him... just please, please leave in peace...Elixir of Agony^28^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Lydon^Elixir of Agony^Elixir of Pain^^Bring 6 Mudsnout Blossoms to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^Another day, another elixir to be made. If it were up to me, I'd just let the pathetic humans and Scourge fight it out. They seem bent on killing each other as is. Alas, our Dark Lady wants to help speed up the process a tad so why not pass these morbid days by spreading a little death and disease across the land? Here's the plan, <name>: you go out to Nethander Stead, south of Tarren Mill and east of the river and Southshore. Collect for me 6 Mudsnout Blossoms from the field for my next elixir.Foreboding Plans^34^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Syndicate Documents^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Foreboding Plans^^^Bring the Foreboding Plans to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore.^Among these documents is a list of requested supplies. These include mundane items (food, weapons, clothing) as well as more exotic gear (masks, oil, poison). But what is most notable is the urgency of the request - these supplies were needed soon in order to undertake what is described in the document as an "important mission against Southshore."Encrypted Letter^34^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Syndicate Documents^Loremaster Dibbs^Encrypted Letter^^^Bring the Encrypted Letter to Loremaster Dibbs in Southshore.^One of the letters on this table is encrypted and inscrutable.Noble Deaths^36^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Foreboding Plans^^^Bring 7 Alterac Signet Rings to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore.^I fear the leadership behind the Syndicate is bent on Southshore's ruin. We must strike hard at these leaders before their plans are realized. Enter the ruins of Strahnbrad, in the Alterac Mountains to the north. We think the Syndicate is using the area as a headquarters. We know this gang of cutthroats is run by former Alterac nobles. They may be hiding as normal Syndicate agents, but you'll know you've killed a noble by the signet ring he wears. Bring me those signet rings.Elixir of Agony^28^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Master Apothecary Faranell^Elixir of Agony^^^Take the Mudsnout Composite to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.^Just when I thought another day was going to pass devoid of any joy, you brought me those marvelous Mudsnout Blossoms. First I will mix them down into a fine composite. We'll then need Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity to apply his colloid of decay to it and then we'll be ready for some good fun indeed! Here, take this Mudsnout Composite and run it off to Master Faranell at once, <name>.Letter to Stormpike^34^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Loremaster Dibbs^Prospector Stormpike^Encrypted Letter^^^Take the Cleverly Encrypted Letter to Prospector Stormpike in Ironforge.^I have a colleague in Ironforge who may be able to help decrypt this letter. Go to the Library in the Hall of Explorers in Ironforge and speak with Prospector Stormpike. Tell him I sent you and show him the letter. If there's anyone north of Blackrock Spire who can read this, it is he.Elixir of Agony^30^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Master Apothecary Faranell^Apothecary Lydon^Elixir of Agony^^^Bring the Mudsnout Mixture, a Strong Troll's Blood Potion, 5 Daggerspine Scales and 5 Torn Fin Eyes to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^A mudsnout composite? Absolutely brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? Let me contribute my colloid of decay to this devilish brew. In order to activate the contaminating agents in this mudsnout mixture, Lydon is going to need a strong troll's blood potion, as well as some daggerspine scales and torn fin eyes from the southern coast of Hillsbrad. He'll know what to do once you've gathered him all the reagents. And my, how anxious I am to hear how his experiment goes!Beren's Peril^21^All^Silverpine Forest^Shadow Priest Allister^Shadow Priest Allister^^^^Locate Beren's Peril, then kill 6 Ravenclaw Drudgers and 6 Ravenclaw Guardians, then return to Shadow Priest Allister at the Sepulcher.^I have received reports that a group of undead are holing up to prepare for an attack against us. Armed with this information, we can turn the tables and attack them first, nipping their little plan in the bud. Unfortunately, my information is spotty, at best. They are reported to be hiding in a location known as Beren's Peril. The exact location is unknown, but it appears to be a cave in the hills, near a pocket of Dalaran wizards. I trust your resourcefulness. Find them, and put them down.Elixir of Agony^30^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Lydon^Elixir of Agony^^^Bring a keg of Shindigger Stout to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^This new elixir is finally ready to be tested. But why let a perfectly good, highly contagious plague go to waste on a mere frog or dog? Let's have us some true fun in the name of Lady Sylvanas. Head down to Dun Garok. You know the barracks where those filthy little dwarves skitter about. Steal me a keg of their Shindigger Stout. Once I have that keg, you and I will have quite the party, <name>.The Crown of Will^39^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Melisara^Melisara^The Crown of Will^^^Kill 10 Crushridge Maulers for Melisara in Tarren Mill.^Mug'Thol and his Crushridge ogres have overrun the ruins of Alterac. It will be hard to inflict any serious punishment upon him without thinning out the ogres' numbers. After softening them up, we'll proceed. Understood? Good. Now go.The Crown of Will^41^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Melisara^Melisara^The Crown of Will^^^Kill Targ, Muckrake, and Glommus and bring their heads to Melisara in Tarren Mill.^Targ, Muckrake, and Glommus are Mug'Thol's lieutenants. They are loyal to him, though who can say what drives an ogre to loyalty. Bring me their heads, <name>, and then all that will remain is to remove Mug'Thol's head, crown and all.The Crown of Will^43^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Melisara^Melisara^The Crown of Will^^^Kill Mug'Thol, and return his head with the Crown of Will to Melisara in Tarren Mill.^With Mug'Thol's lieutenants dead, all that remains is to kill Mug'Thol and retrieve the Crown of Will. I have no doubt he'll be reluctant to part with it. Most likely expecting you, too, given the... departure... of his fellows. Find Mug'Thol, and deliver his head and the Crown to me. The Crushridge resistance will be at an end.The Crown of Will^43^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Melisara^Sharlindra^The Crown of Will^^^Deliver the Crown of Will to Sharlindra in the Undercity.^All that remains is to deliver the Crown of Will to Sharlindra in the Undercity. She will see that it is delivered to Lady Sylvanas. I would warn you against thinking to use it for your own purposes, <name>, Mug'Thol's fate should be illustration enough.Assassin's Contract^38^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Assassin's Contract^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Assassin's Contract^^^Bring the Assassin's Contract to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore.^This is a contract for the assassination of Magistrate Henry Maleb. It was sealed and stamped in red wax, using a distinctive signet ring.Baron's Demise^40^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Assassin's Contract^^^Bring the Head of Baron Vardus to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore.^The contract you recovered was signed by Baron Vardus, a noble of the former kingdom of Alterac, and one known for a cold heart and brutal practices. I'm not surprised someone like the Baron was behind this. Find this man. Find him, and bring him to justice. He must be among the Syndicate haunts - perhaps at the ruins of Strahnbrad, or perhaps within the valley north of them.Elixir of Agony^30^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Apothecary Lydon^Dusty Rug^Elixir of Agony^^^Place the Tainted Keg on the rug for the captured farmers.^Next door the Deathguards are holding a few captured farmers hostage. High Executor Darthalia suspected one of the military strategists from Stormwind to be hiding out amongst them. Apparently the military chap was found dead in the Plaguelands last night. Darthalia, always looking out for me, decided the prisoners would be left to my disposal. I think it's time we threw those farmers a party. Sounds like a grand ol' time! Place this tainted keg on the rug in their room. Plagued brew for all!Further Mysteries^34^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Prospector Stormpike^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Encrypted Letter^^^Bring the Decrypted Letter to Magistrate Maleb in Southshore.^I decrypted the letter, but I don't know what to make of it. You found this among thieves in the Alterac foothills? Very strange... You should take this to the magistrate of Southshore. Although this letter is cryptic, his is the closest town to Alterac; if a threat is brewing, then he should know.Lightforge Ingots^29^Alliance^Duskwood^Glorin Steelbrow^Glorin Steelbrow^Lightforge Ingots^The Lost Ingots^^Gather 5 lightforge ingots, then return to Glorin Steelbrow in the Wetlands.^You might have found one lightforge ingot in that chest, but that's not enough to craft anything decent! You should go back there and look for more. Maybe the murlocs around that wrecked ship have lightforge ingots on them.Battle of Hillsbrad^24^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^High Executor Darthalia^Battle of Hillsbrad^^^Kill 6 Hillsbrad Farmhands, 6 Hillsbrad Farmers, Farmer Ray and Farmer Getz and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill.^Stand at attention while addressing me, <class>. I am under direct command of Varimathras. We are to quell the human infestation until our apothecaries can develop the new plague. Our information leads us to believe that the town of Hillsbrad is vulnerable to attack. Your first assignment is aimed at disrupting their food supply and infrastructure. Travel west. Raid the northernmost farms of Hillsbrad Fields. Make sure that the landowners, Farmer Ray and Farmer Getz, are executed as well.Battle of Hillsbrad^25^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^High Executor Darthalia^Battle of Hillsbrad^^^Kill 15 Hillsbrad Peasants and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill.^Word of the attack on the northern farms has the townsfolk panicked. Most excellent. Our Deathstalkers report peasants fleeing to the fields in southern Hillsbrad. The fools think they can hide in the orchards and escape their doom. Prove them wrong, <name>. Return to Hillsbrad Fields and seek out the cowering peasants. Lay waste to them in the name of our Dark Lady. Dismissed!Battle of Hillsbrad^26^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^High Executor Darthalia^Battle of Hillsbrad^^^Kill Blacksmith Verringtan and 4 Hillsbrad Apprentice Blacksmiths.^The humans of Hillsbrad have been putting up unexpected resistance. The problem appears to be that the townsfolk are being armed by the local blacksmith. We need to shut down all supply lines. Your mission will be to execute Blacksmith Verringtan. Slay his apprentices as well. While there, bring back a shipment of iron from their stockpile. The supplies will come in handy when we are done with the conquering of Hillsbrad and begin razing Southshore.A Husband's Revenge^20^All^Silverpine Forest^Raleigh Andrean^Raleigh Andrean^The Engraved Ring^^^Kill Valdred Moray.^Valdred, once my good friend, was my wife's murderer. Although I am incapable of grieving, I do yearn for revenge. If you kill Valdred and bring me his cursed hands, then I will reward you. I last heard he was at the Greymane Wall in southern Silverpine, trying to flee into the kingdom of Gilneas.Vyrin's Revenge^20^Alliance^Loch Modan^Daryl the Youngling^Vyrin Swiftwind^Vyrin's Revenge^^^Bring Ol' Sooty's head to Vyrin Swiftwind at the Farstrider Lodge.^Light! Don't bring things like that into the Lodge... it's unsanitary, unspeakable, un... un... unsanitary! Just get it out of here, will you? No one wants to see your bloody little trophy, really!Battle of Hillsbrad^26^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^High Executor Darthalia^Battle of Hillsbrad^^^Kill Magistrate Burnside and 4 Hillsbrad Councilmen. Destroy the Hillsbrad Proclamation. Steal the Hillsbrad Town Registry. Report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill afterwards.^The town of Hillsbrad is in disarray and we believe it will soon fall. We must, however, persist in our ruthlessness until the human scum are wiped from the foothills for eternity. Despite their overwhelming losses, the humans rally around their leadership and keep fighting. We must eliminate their leader, Magistrate Burnside, as well as the town council. Destroy their revered political document as well, the Hillsbrad Proclamation. And while you're at it, steal the town registry.Infiltration^34^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Krusk^Krusk^Infiltration^^^Retrieve information about Gol'dir's whereabouts for Krusk in Tarren Mill.^At last we begin to hear word and rumor, find evidence of Gol'dir's whereabouts. The humans have been moving him around, but we are narrowing down our search and focusing on the large Syndicate camp just north of here. Go there, <name>, and bring back whatever information you can get your hands on.Valik^34^All^Alterac Mountains^Henchman Valik^Henchman Valik^^^^Bring a mug of Southshore Stout to Valik in the Syndicate camp.^Urrgh... Injured and dying and confronted with the enemy. No doubt you'll kill me anyway, but if you bring me some Southshore stout--your kind does drink, don't they?--I'll tell you what you want to know.Down the Coast^30^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Down the Coast^^^Kill 10 Torn Fin Tidehunters and 10 Torn Fin Oracles for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore.^Transferred from the Stormwind city guard to Southshore, a town that should be abandoned by the looks of it... Smell of the harbor day and night. Not to mention ol' Redpath... Wants me to take care of the murlocs. Ha! I can barely rouse myself to go out to some of the pockets of the overgrown fish down the Western Strand. If you would go in my place and take care of them, I'd appreciate it.Dark Council^40^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Magistrate Henry Maleb^Encrypted Letter^^^Kill 4 Argus Shadow Mages.^The letter you brought me was written by a being who calls himself Nagaz, a member of the Argus Wake. I don't know what this Argus Wake is, but if they're in alliance with the Syndicate then they must be a threat. I want you to find Nagaz and the Argus Shadow Mages mentioned in that letter. I want you to find them, and kill them. Search in the Uplands, where the Syndicate is strongest. It is north of Strahnbrad. With luck, you'll find these envoys of the Argus Wake there.Southshore^38^Alliance^Stormwind City^Milton Sheaf^Loremaster Dibbs^An Old History Book^^^Speak with Loremaster Dibbs in Southshore.^<name>. If you don't mind a long journey then I have a task for you, to again help Stormwind fill its library. The old kingdom of Alterac fell after the great war, and it had a large collection of books. It's a tragedy that the city is ruined, but even more tragic is all of their knowledge lost! We must recover what we can. Southshore is the closest town to the Ruins of Alterac. Go there and speak with Loremaster Dibbs. He can direct you to the ruins, and to what books may be found there.Battle of Hillsbrad^28^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^High Executor Darthalia^Battle of Hillsbrad^^^Kill Foreman Bonds and 10 Hillsbrad Miners and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill.^The Hillsbrad Town Registry indicates that the Azurelode Mine is under Alliance control. Furthermore, the mine is a prime source of iron ore for the Alliance armories. Even though we've struck a decisive blow to the town of Hillsbrad, the Alliance still supports and protects the Azurelode Mine fervently. The mine lies due south of Hillsbrad. Go there and slay the foreman, a human by the name of Bonds. Kill his miners as well. That should send a clear message to the Alliance.Preserving Knowledge^38^Alliance^Stormwind City^Loremaster Dibbs^Loremaster Dibbs^An Old History Book^^^Bring 5 Recovered Tomes and the Worn Leather Book containing The Arm of Gri'lek to Loremaster Dibbs in Southshore.^Those beastly ogres now reside within Alterac's ruins, and I shudder to think what they're doing with the precious books still there. You must recover what you can! Enter the Ruins of Alterac and search for tomes looted by the ogres. Get whatever you can find and bring them to me, but also seek out one book in particular: The Arm of Gri'lek. It contains ancient troll lore that I must learn, and the Ruins of Alterac was the last known location of an intact copy of this book.Battle of Hillsbrad^30^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^High Executor Darthalia^Battle of Hillsbrad^^Battle of Hillsbrad^Travel to Dun Garok and kill 8 Mountaineers, 4 Riflemen, 2 Priests and Captain Ironhill and report back to Darthalia in Tarren Mill.^Dwarves aiding the humans? Damn those filthy little beasts. We shall test the strength of the so-called Alliance. We'll see how anxious those little ankle-bashers are to help the humans once they feel our wrath. We know exactly where their stronghold is in this territory. They have established a barracks in southeastern Hillsbrad along Thoradin's Wall called Dun Garok. The final mission of this battle is to lay siege on Dun Garok, <class>. Captain Ironhill, their leader, must die.Return to Milton^38^Alliance^Stormwind City^Loremaster Dibbs^Milton Sheaf^An Old History Book^^^Bring the Tomes of Alterac to Milton Sheaf in Stormwind.^I need to spend some time studying the Arm of Gri'lek book you brought me, though I'm sure Milton is eager to get the other recovered books into Stormwind's collection. Here are the books you gathered from the Ruins of Alterac, packed and catalogued. Take them back to Milton Sheaf in Stormwind and I'm sure he'll be grateful.The Perenolde Tiara^40^Alliance^Stormwind City^Count Remington Ridgewell^Count Remington Ridgewell^^^^Bring the Perenolde Tiara to Remington Ridgewell in Stormwind.^The Perenolde Tiara is an old heirloom of the Perenolde "nobles" - the ruling family of Alterac before that kingdom fell to ruin. It is said to have been crafted by master jewelers in Ironforge, and fitted with the finest of emeralds. When Alterac was destroyed the Tiara was lost, but there are rumors that an Ogre Mage, Grel'borg the Miser, found the tiara and now wanders the Ruins of Alterac searching for more treasures. We would have you acquire the tiara for us.Prison Break In^34^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Magus Wordeen Voidglare^Magus Wordeen Voidglare^Prison Break In^^^Find the traitors and recover their artifacts, then return to Magus Voidglare in Tarren Mill.^I came to Tarren Mill to research, but now must resolve a crisis. You see, four Forsaken fled the Undercity a few months ago. They turned their backs on their brethren, but what's worse...they stole from the Dark Lady. These thieves broke into a secure vault and stole four artifacts, items our apothecaries required in certain studies. Sylvanas would have these artifacts returned. The thieves fled the Undercity to Dalaran, and those wizards quarantined them in the Lordamere Internment Camp.Dalaran Patrols^35^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Magus Wordeen Voidglare^Magus Wordeen Voidglare^Prison Break In^^^Kill 6 Dalaran Summoners and 12 Elemental Slaves, then return to Magus Voidglare in Tarren Mill.^The wizards of Dalaran constructed a vast, magical dome around the heart of their city. Some believe it was for protection from the violence of these times, while others say they merely wanted solitude, to study and plot. I don't care what the reason was. I do care that the ruined outskirts of their city may hide valuable magical treasures. But the area is patrolled by the wizards and their elemental slaves. So hunt them, and return when their numbers are sufficiently reduced.Souvenirs of Death^25^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Deathguard Samsa^Deathguard Samsa^^^^Deathguard Samsa of Tarren Mill wants 30 Hillsbrad Human Skulls.^I hear you were enlisted by Darthalia to wage war on the humans of Hillsbrad. So jealous I am. . . While you're off having all the fun -- slaying humans, pillaging the town, terrorizing innocent people -- I am stuck standing guard here in Tarren Mill. Perhaps you'll take pity on an old Deathguard like myself? You see I am collecting human skulls. And you will be fighting humans for quite some time. Over the course of your long battle, bring me 30 skulls and I will make it worth your while.Humbert's Sword^30^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Deathguard Humbert^Deathguard Humbert^^^^Retrieve Deathguard Humbert's sword from Dun Garok and return it to him in Tarren Mill.^High Executor Darthalia sent me to keep watch of Dun Garok from a distance. I had set up camp just out of sight. But when morning came and I had to boil water, I left to gather firewood. When I returned to camp, I discovered my gear was missing. Apparently some dwarven scouts from Dun Garok had passed by and made off with it. I need my sword! If you can get it back for me I would be so grateful. So many dwarves there...it will be quite difficult to find the dirty little thief who stole it.WANTED: Syndicate Personnel^22^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^WANTED^High Executor Darthalia^^^^Kill 10 Syndicate Rogues and 10 Syndicate Watchmen. Return to High Executor Darthalia in Tarren Mill for your reward.^By the authority of Lady Sylvanas, all members of the organization known as the Syndicate are wanted dead. Those brought into custody or taken prisoner will be summarily executed. They are currently known to be amassing in the ruins of Durnholde Keep, to the southeast of Tarren Mill. A handsome reward is offered to all who bring proof of their deeds to High Executor Darthalia.The Ensorcelled Parchment^40^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Ensorcelled Parchment^Loremaster Dibbs^The Ensorcelled Parchment^^^Take the Ensorcelled Parchment to Loremaster Dibbs at Southshore in Hillsbrad Foothills.^This parchment is enchanted with a spell, rendering it indecipherable. But one word at the top of the paper can be read:  Nagaz Helcular's Revenge^33^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Novice Thaivand^Novice Thaivand^Helcular's Revenge^^^Retrieve Helcular's Rod from the Yeti and bring it back to Novice Thaivand in Tarren Mill.^Master Helcular was almost complete with his transformation into a Lich when a human lynch mob discovered his ritual lair in the hills and brutally killed him. To make matters worse they buried his corpse in the Southshore cemetery. Such disregard for the great wizard is unacceptable. As his apprentice I shall see to it that the rains of vengeance fall upon the town of Southshore. We will need Helcular's Rod first. Yeti overtook his ritual lair. Undoubtedly one of the beasts has it.Helcular's Revenge^33^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Novice Thaivand^Helcular's Grave^Helcular's Revenge^^^Charge the Rod of Helcular with the powers of the Flame of Azel, Flame of Veraz and the Flame of Uzel.^Here, take the Rod of Helcular. You will need it. Helcular fashioned 3 ceremonial pyres as part of his most powerful spell. The Flame of Azel and the Flame of Veraz lie within the Foothill Caverns. The Flame of Uzel lies in a cave above the caverns, further north in the mountains. The Rod of Helcular must be charged from each of the three flames. Once the ritual is complete, drive the rod into Helcular's grave in Southshore, the heavily guarded human town to the south. Vengeance shall be ours!Stormpike's Deciphering^40^Alliance^Alterac Mountains^Loremaster Dibbs^Prospector Stormpike^The Ensorcelled Parchment^^^Take the Ensorcelled Parchment to Prospector Stormpike in Ironforge.^Prospector Stormpike is a master of decryption and deciphering. If you take the parchment you found to him, then with luck he can make sense of it. Stormpike is currently studying in the Prospector headquarters in Ironforge. And when you see him tell him you spoke with me - I've been sending him quite a lot of business lately.Soothing Turtle Bisque^31^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Chef Jessen^Chef Jessen^^^^Bring 10 pieces of Turtle Meat to Chef Jessen in Southshore.^If there's one thing you'll learn about Southshore it's that we have some of the best cuisine north of Stormwind! Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks to travel from as far as Darkshire just to enjoy a bowl. Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately. I used to head up past Dalaran to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt Snapjaws but it's just too dangerous now. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the Snapjaws up north, I'll whip some up!Stone Tokens^32^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Keeper Bel'varil^Keeper Bel'varil^^^Bracers of Binding^Bring 10 Worn Stone Tokens to Keeper Bel'varil in Tarren Mill.^A notable talent of the wizards of Dalaran is their familiarity with elementals: powerful creatures from other dimensions. The wizards use magical tokens as a means to control these elementals. Magus Voidglare would like some of these tokens to study. Enter the territories of the Dalaran wizards, west of Hillsbrad, and gather the tokens. You might find the tokens on any citizen of Dalaran, but I suggest hunting at the internment camp. It's safer than Dalaran itself.Bracers of Binding^34^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Keeper Bel'varil^Keeper Bel'varil^^Stone Tokens^^Bring 4 Bracers of Earth Binding to Keeper Bel'varil in Tarren Mill.^The Magus will be busy studying those stone tokens you gathered, but I know he'll eventually want examples of their counterpart: bracers of binding. These are set around the wrists of actual elementals, and bind them into the mage's service. Hunt elementals in the ruins of Dalaran and gather their Bracers of Earth Binding, and the Magus will be pleased.Farren's Proof^32^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Down the Coast^^^Collect 10 Murloc Heads from the murlocs on the Western Strand for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore.^Would you believe it, <name>? Redpath wasn't satisfied with all the murlocs we killed--oh now, don't be modest, you had some hand in it. Now he wants me to bring proof of the dead, hacking off cold, slimy murloc heads to submit for his approval.Farren's Proof^32^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Marshal Redpath^Down the Coast^^^Deliver the sack of murloc heads to Marshall Redpath in Southshore.^You know, <name>, I'd really rather not take these heads... Since you've already got a handle on them, would you mind delivering them to Redpath for me?Farren's Proof^32^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Marshal Redpath^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Down the Coast^^^Speak with Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore.^Please inform Lieutenant Orinelle that I would like him to refocus his efforts on the naga infesting the Eastern Strand. When he has results, tell him to report to me in person.Stormwind Ho!^32^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Down the Coast^^^Kill 10 Daggerspine Shorehunters and 10 Daggerspine Sirens for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore.^My former mentor in the Stormwind city guard sent a message to me that Alliance High Command is becoming concerned with the threat posed by the naga. From what he's heard, there's good chances for promotion--or at least reassignment--for anyone who proves valuable in this regard. There's just one small problem... I can't handle the naga, <name>. Oh sure, I could break up a drunken barroom brawl, or haul off a belligerent beggar, but the naga are too much for me. You've got to help me, <name>!Reassignment^32^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Lieutenant Farren Orinelle^Major Samuelson^Down the Coast^^^Deliver Farren's report to Major Samuelson in Stormwind Keep.^It shouldn't be a problem getting my report seen. The new captain of the guard, Major Samuelson, was my mentor while I was stationed in Stormwind. It should give him more than enough excuse to have me transferred back to the city. I'll need you to carry my report to him, though... wouldn't want ol' Redpath to catch on.Costly Menace^34^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Darren Malvew^Darren Malvew^^^^Darren Malvew of Southshore wants you to kill 8 Mountain Lions and 10 Hulking Mountain Lions.^Ain't nothin' that irks me more than losin' these here beautiful horses. And believe me, we've lost quite a few between them pesky undead creeps, the dang Syndicate gang and all the other good-for-nothin' scoundrels pokin' about these parts. But I swear on my ol' grand-daddy's grave there ain't no bigger menace to our horses here than them Mountain Lions up in Alterac. Always comin' down from the hills and makin' my life difficult! You fancy yourself a hero? Go and do somethin' about it then!Bartolo's Yeti Fur Cloak^34^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Bartolo Ginsetti^Bartolo Ginsetti^^^^Bring Bartolo Ginsetti of Southshore a Bolt of Wool, a Hillman's Cloak, Fine Thread and 10 clumps of Yeti Fur.^I, the great Bartolo, shall make for you the world famous, Alliance renowned, Yeti Fur Cloak! Travel the planet and find yourself a better cloak, I dare you. Oh wait, what is that, little <race>? "Bartolo, there is no finer cloak!" Yes, yes! That, I have heard before. Bartolo requires a Bolt of Wool, a Hillman's Cloak made by a skilled leatherworker, Fine Thread and Yeti Fur, of course! Bring to me these items and you shall be a happy customer!WANTED: Baron Vardus^40^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^WANTED^High Executor Darthalia^^^^Kill Baron Vardus and deliver his head to High Executor Darthalia in Tarren Mill.^By order of High Executor Darthalia, the human known as Baron Vardus is wanted for crimes against the Forsaken. Vardus is known to be a high-ranking member of the organization known as the Syndicate. He was last spotted in the Uplands in the Alterac Mountains, north of Tarren Mill. He is wanted dead. Bring evidence of his demise to High Executor Darthalia to claim the reward.Dangerous!^28^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Dangerous!^High Executor Darthalia^^^^High Executor Darthalia of Tarren Mill is offering a bounty on Clerk Horrace Whitesteed, Citizen Wilkes, Miner Hackett and Farmer Kalaba.^Dangerous! The following humans of Hillsbrad have been deemed dangerous and are marked for bounty by High Executor Darthalia: Clerk Horrace Whitesteed. Wanted for the murder of Deathguard Toma. Citizen Wilkes. Wanted for the murder of Apothecary Eli. Miner Hackett. Wanted for the murder of Deathstalker Fry. Farmer Kalaba. Wanted for the ambush of supplies from the Undercity. All of these enemies are hiding and will be hard to find. A reward will be granted upon notice of their death.The Defense of Grom'gol^36^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Commander Aggro'gosh^Commander Aggro'gosh^The Defense of Grom'gol^^^Commander Aggro'gosh of the Grom'gol base camp wants you to kill 15 Lashtail Raptors.^Throm'ka, <class>! Your arrival at Grom'gol is timely, indeed. As commander of the Warchief's base camp here in the jungle I am bound by honor to ensure the safety of all members of the Horde. Our mission to provide a safe chain of supply to Stonard is being hampered by some of the local inhabitants. I am putting you in charge of thinning out the raptor population outside of Grom'gol. Once you have made significant progress, report back to me for reassignment.The Defense of Grom'gol^37^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Commander Aggro'gosh^Commander Aggro'gosh^The Defense of Grom'gol^^^Commander Aggro'gosh of the Grom'gol base camp wants you to kill 10 Ogre Brutes and 5 Ogre Witch Doctors.^When we first arrived in this jungle we did not intend to wage war on the local tribes. Our mission to supply Stonard is of the highest priority. But complications have arisen. A local band of ogres has occupied the Mizjah Ruins to the southeast of Grom'gol. Despite warnings, they continue to ambush our supply caravans. I am putting you in charge of dealing with these uncooperative ogres. Travel to the ruins and attempt to drive them from the area. At the very least it will send a firm message.Mok'thardin's Enchantment^38^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Mok'thardin's Enchantment^^^Far Seer Mok'thardin at the Grom'gol base camp wants 8 Shadowmaw Claws and a Pristine Tigress Fang.^The power of the jungle's magic must be realized and then harnessed by the Horde. My rituals have proven successful so far. I can cast very powerful enchantments. For you, brave <class>, I shall make a special item indeed. Bring to me some Shadowmaw Panther claws along with a Tigress fang. Not just any fang will do. It must be in pristine condition. The beasts lurk throughout the jungle but you will find some close by, just across the river from Mizjah Ruins to the southeast.Mok'thardin's Enchantment^41^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Mok'thardin's Enchantment^^^Bring an Aged Gorilla Sinew to Far Seer Mok'thardin in Grom'gol.^What I need from you now will be very difficult to obtain. To hold all these feathers, claws and the pristine fang in place I require a magical tether. Only an aged gorilla sinew will work. You will only be able to find one on an Elder Mistvale Gorilla. They are known to forage to the east of Booty Bay. The sinew must be perfect. It might take quite a few kills for you to find exactly what I need but it will be well worth the hunt.Mok'thardin's Enchantment^41^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Mok'thardin's Enchantment^^^Bring 10 Jungle Stalker Feathers to Far Seer Mok'thardin at the Grom'gol base camp.^The items you gathered from the feline beasts of the Vale are only the first requirement for a powerful enchanted item. These jungle trinkets combined with my shamanistic ritual will provide you with a very useful tool in assisting the Horde and the Warchief. But now you must gather for me some Jungle Stalker Feathers. The feathers are traditionally worn by the beasts on their armbands. You will find a tribe of the raptors directly south of Grom'gol, not far from the great arena.Mok'thardin's Enchantment^44^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Far Seer Mok'thardin^Mok'thardin's Enchantment^^^Far Seer Mok'thardin of Grom'gol needs Holy Spring Water. He also wants you to kill 10 Naga Explorers.^There is but one final reagent needed to complete the enchantment. In the south, towards the western coast, high above the bluffs, lies a Holy Spring. This spring is the subject of great conflict amongst religious and mystical scholars. Every race in Azeroth claims that the spring waters were made divine for their people. My final request of you: bring to me Holy Spring Water. Be warned. An expedition of naga explorers have advanced upon the spring. They will need to be dealt with as well.Special Forces^38^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Sergeant Yohwa^Lieutenant Doren^Special Forces^The Second Rebellion, Bad Medicine^^Kill 10 Kurzen Commandoes and 6 Kurzen Headshrinkers.^Now that many of his regular troops are reduced, you must face his highly trained forces. When they're not in the wilderness slaughtering our rebel soldiers, they are found deep in the back of the Kurzen Compound, in a cave they call the Stockpile. I know many of Kurzen's troops personally, and I know they are skilled, loyal, and cruel. This is no easy task I set before you, <name>. After you defeat them, report to Lieutenant Doren, my commanding officer. He will want your report firsthand.Supply and Demand^31^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Drizzlik^Drizzlik^^^Some Assembly Required^Bring 2 Large River Crocolisk Skins to Drizzlik in Booty Bay.^"The finest leathercrafter of the South Seas and the worlds old and new." That's what they call me. Me! Drizzlik! The finest lea... Ahem. Well. My leather goods are known far and wide as the most exquisite, a connoisseur's choice! I've just received an order from Director Riddlevox of the Tinkers' Union for a dozen of his favorite Excelsior-line boots. Our best sellers, actually. To start on the basic shape, I'll need crocolisk skins from the crocs along the river in northern Stranglethorn.Keep An Eye Out^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Dizzy One-Eye^Dizzy One-Eye^^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^Dizzy One-Eye in Booty Bay wants you to retrieve his eye from the Bloodsail Buccaneers.^Avast! Who goes there? Argh, I am but useless without me special enchanted eye. Bad enough to have lost me eyes in battle in the first place! But by some stroke o' luck we docked in Menethil and a traveling wizard enchanted a special glass eye that let me see again. Last night I ended up gettin' jumped by some Bloodsail Buccaneers on me way out. Took me eye, they did! Seems those blokes have found their way to Booty Bay. Help an old sea dog out by gettin' me eye back?Some Assembly Required^36^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Drizzlik^Drizzlik^Some Assembly Required^Supply and Demand^^Bring 5 Snapjaw Crocolisks Skins to Drizzlik in Booty Bay.^Well, I've got the basic shape of the boots worked out, and they're coming along fine, but the skins you brought aren't going to be quite enough for the inner layers. "What are we going to do, Drizzlik?" No doubt the question on your lips, and well, isn't it lucky you're talking to Drizzlik, because he's going to tell you what we're going to do! The inner layers will never really be seen, so we'll just get some of the thicker, cheaper skins from the crocs around Lake Nazferiti to fill the boots out.The Stone of the Tides^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Baron Revilgaz^Baron Revilgaz^The Haunted Isle^^^Find the haunted island for Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay.^If there is indeed a goblin mage and water elementals haunting the island, it could mean the Stone of the Tides can be mine! I want you to locate this haunted island... find out what's going on. Oh, and if you perhaps want to find out more about the Stone of the Tides, take this scrip to the Stormwind Library, they should be able to find you a copy of the book I first came across the legend in. Could it be that Gazban actually discovered the Stone...?Whiskey Slim's Lost Grog^50^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Whiskey Slim^Whiskey Slim^^^^Whiskey Slim in Booty Bay wants you to bring him the bottles of Pupellyverbos Port he lost.^We was splicin' the mainbrace somethin' fierce off of the Overlook Cliffs, ol' Hinterlands just in the distance. Thought the seas was goin' to swallow us whole. Ol' Slim knows all about liquid courage! Cap'n had a crate of Pupellyverbos Port we commandeered from a privateer en route to Stormwind. So when that storm off of Hinterlands hit, I busted into the grog. Big wave hit and tossed them bottles overboard. Cap'n is goin' to give me a taste o' the cat if ye don't help me get 'em back though!Hunt for Yenniku^34^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Nimboya^Nimboya^Hunt for Yenniku^^^Bring 9 Bloodscalp Tusks to Nimboya at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^A doom, there is. A doom on my chief's youngest son, Yenniku. As is a custom with our people, he was given to the Gurubashi Trolls of Zul'Gurub, but after my tribe, the Darkspear tribe, left with the orc Thrall, poor Yenniku was lost to us. I was sent from distant Orgrimmar, back to Stranglethorn, to search for my chief's son. And I believe the Bloodscalp tribe has him. If you would help me, then hunt the Bloodscalps. You may find them to the north. Gather their tusks and return to me.Headhunting^37^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Nimboya^Nimboya^Hunt for Yenniku^^Bloodscalp Clan Heads^Bring 20 Shrunken Heads to Nimboya at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^We must find if Yenniku is dead. Slay the Bloodscalp Headhunters and take from them their Shrunken Heads. You must gather many, many heads, and I will inspect them to make sure Yenniku's head is not among them. And if Yenniku was killed by the Bloodscalps, then may a 600-year curse fall on the spirit of their chief, Gan'zulah! Go, <name>. You may find many Headhunters at the ruins of Zuuldaia and Zul'Kunda, along the coast to the north.Welcome to the Jungle^30^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Barnil Stonepot^Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^^^Tiger Mastery, Panther Mastery, Raptor Mastery, The Green Hills of Stranglethorn^Speak with Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^Welcome to Stranglethorn! Perhaps you're not aware of this, but that dwarf over there is the son of the one and only Hemet Nesingwary, renowned war hero of the Alliance and master big game hunter. Like his father, he's not one for welcoming strangers into his camp, but you look like you've seen quite a bit of action in your day, <class>. Go and speak with him. He's a chip off the old block, so perhaps he can give you some hunting pointers.Bloodscalp Clan Heads^41^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Nimboya^Bubbling Cauldron^^Headhunting^Speaking with Nezzliok, Speaking with Gan'zulah^Bring Gan'zulah's Head and Nezzliok's Head to the bubbling cauldron at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^Yenniku was not among the heads, and I thank the Great Serpent for it. But we are no closer to finding him. We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp chief and his witchdoctor know it. They are the enemies of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from their dead lips! Bring me the heads of Gan'zulah and Nezzliok the Dire and place them within this cauldron. They are deep within Zul'Kunda. Bring their heads...we will then make them talk.Speaking with Nezzliok^40^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Bubbling Cauldron^Bubbling Cauldron^^Bloodscalp Clan Heads^The Fate of Yenniku^Bring a Balia'mah Trophy, a Ziata'jai Trophy and a Zul'Mamwe Trophy to the Bubbling Cauldron at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^<The head of Nezzliok speaks.> It is true. I know where the child of the Darkspears was taken. You have bested me and bound my spirit, but I will say nothing without appeasement! The Bloodscalps war with the Skullsplitters. To gain my favor, steal from the Skullsplitters 3 of their trophy skulls and place them here with us, so that my spirit will have slaves in the Nether. One skull must be from their trophy pile in Balia'mah, another from Ziata'jai, and the last from Zul'Mamwe.Speaking with Gan'zulah^46^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Bubbling Cauldron^Bubbling Cauldron^^Bloodscalp Clan Heads^The Fate of Yenniku^Kill 8 Skullsplitter Hunters, 6 Skullsplitter Headhunters, and 4 Skullsplitter Berserkers.^<The head of Gan'zulah speaks.> Curse you! And curse your ancestors!! Only blood and revenge can cool my rage, so if that is your wish, then... do this: Throw yourself into the heart of the Skullsplitters to the east. Slay the fiercest among them, and if you survive...then break yourself against their chief, Ana'thek the Cruel. Hah! Bring me his shattered armor if you can! May he tear off your limbs and leave you to rot and be eaten by carrion.Up to Snuff^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Deeg^Deeg^^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^Deeg in Booty Bay wants you to bring him 15 shares of Snuff.^Ah, the sea life. I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life. When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff. Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right? So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff. Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders. I bet a fearless <class> like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh?The Fate of Yenniku^45^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Bubbling Cauldron^Kin'weelay^The Fate of Yenniku^Speaking with Nezzliok, Speaking with Gan'zulah^^Speak with Kin'weelay.^<Nezzliok speaks.> You have appeased myself and my chief, so I will tell you that which you seek to discover... Young Yenniku is lost to his clan. He was taken by the witchdoctor Zanzil the Outcast. Now Zanzil controls him, body and soul, and only the most potent magic could set him free. A magic that you do not have, <class>. Perhaps your Darkspear allies can offer a hope of Yenniku's salvation. But that, I doubt.The Singing Crystals^45^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Kin'weelay^Kin'weelay^The Fate of Yenniku^^^Bring 3 Pulsing Blue Shards to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^Legends tell of a jewel, hidden deep in the heart of Stranglethorn. We call it the Mind's Eye, and it has great powers. If you gain this Eye then, perhaps, we can use it to bring lost Yenniku back from the darkness. I will consult with the spirits of the jungle to find the Mind's Eye. While I do this, you enter the Crystalvein Mine, southeast of here, and gather Pulsing Blue Shards from Ironjaw Basilisks. The shards are rare, but we will need their magic to bend the Mind's Eye to our will.A Rogue's Deal^5^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Calvin Montague^Calvin Montague^^A Rogue's Deal^^Defeat Calvin Montague in Deathknell.^What? What?! You want money? I don't owe you any money. Letter? What letter? Oh, you wanna fight then? All right, mate... let's do this! Owe you any money...The Mind's Eye^46^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Kin'weelay^Kin'weelay^The Fate of Yenniku^^Saving Yenniku^Bring the Mind's Eye to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, east of here and deep within the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound. His name is Mai'Zoth. I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong. And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still. You must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye. It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku.Saving Yenniku^46^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Kin'weelay^Nimboya^^The Mind's Eye^^Bring the Filled Soul Gem to Nimboya.^I have reshaped the Mind's Eye into a Soul Gem. Its purpose is twofold: you must use it to stun Yenniku, and once stunned place it upon his head to entrap his soul. Then, bring the gem to Nimboya. Yenniku dwells with Zanzil the Outcast, at the Ruins of Aboraz, along the Crystal Shore on the distant Cape of Stranglethorn.Message in a Bottle^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Carefully Folded Note^Princess Poobah^Message in a Bottle^^^Find the author of the message in a bottle.^The note reads, in fairly good handwriting: To any that can aid me- Please, my need for help is dire. A great Skymane holds me captive on an island in the South Seas. The stars at night are foreign to me and obscured by the jungle trees, but on the clearest days I see Wild Shore to the northwest, and what seem to be large sailing ships to the southwest. I beg of you, my would-be savior, please help me.The Bloodsail Buccaneers^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^First Mate Crazz^Bloodsail Correspondence^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^Keep An Eye Out, Up to Snuff^First Mate Crazz wants you to check the cove north of Booty Bay.^You sure seem eager to work, matey. Not sure why some land-loving <race> <class> is offering help to the Blackwater Raiders, but I'm not going to turn you away. Our ship just docked here in Booty Bay and word has it that our rivals--those damned, dirty Bloodsail Buccaneers--have been spotted all over southern Stranglethorn. All the boys are too busy hitting the grog and looking for ladies! What I need is a scout. Check the cove just north of Booty Bay along the Savage Coast and see what you find.Bloody Bone Necklaces^37^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Kin'weelay^Kin'weelay^^^Split Bone Necklace^Bring 25 Bloody Bone Necklaces to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^I was sent to Grom'gol to aid Nimboya on his quest, but... I too have reasons for being here. The Bloodscalp tribe is enemy to our tribe. Collecting trophies of our enemies gives us power over them. You may aid our tribe by hunting our enemies. They dwell to the north. Slay Bloodscalp trolls and take from them their bloody bone necklaces. Collect many, and your reward will be great.The Bloodsail Buccaneers^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Bloodsail Correspondence^First Mate Crazz^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^^Report your findings to First Mate Crazz in Booty Bay.^The map shows Booty Bay with a red "X" drawn precisely at the spot at which you are standing. The scribbled text reads: "You men are to secure a camp at this location and keep quiet. Wait for the signal from the southern command post before attacking. If anyone approaches you, kill them."Split Bone Necklace^42^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Kin'weelay^Kin'weelay^^Bloody Bone Necklaces^^Bring 25 Split Bone Necklaces to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base camp.^Now that you have gathered Bloodscalp trophies, I have another task for you. The Skullsplitter tribe of trolls live to the southeast, and for years we have warred with them. Although the Darkspears no longer dwell in Stranglethorn, we are bound to our conflict with the Skullsplitters. So, hunt them. Gather their Split Bone Necklaces and return to me. Aid us in our war, and you will earn the friendship of the Darkspears.The Bloodsail Buccaneers^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^First Mate Crazz^Fleet Master Seahorn^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^^Report the planned Bloodsail attack to Fleet Master Seahorn.^Shiver me timbers! So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay? Why, the nerve of those scoundrels. Booty Bay will always be run by the Blackwater Raiders! This is bigger than I thought. Report what you have learned to Fleet Master Seahorn at once! The ol' sea dog is around town somewhere....Venture Company Mining^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Crank Fizzlebub^Crank Fizzlebub^Singing Blue Shards^^^Bring 10 Singing Blue Crystals to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay.^The Venture Company has a string of operations through Stranglethorn which keeps hard-working goblins, like me, from making honest gold! Please, you must help me! The Venture Company is mining near the Crystalvein Mine to the north. They can't get into the mine because of all the basilisks, but they're still able to dig up Singing Crystals from the surrounding hills. Take their crystals from them, and show them they don't have the run of the jungle. And... um... bring me those crystals as proof!Water Elementals^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Baron Revilgaz^Baron Revilgaz^The Haunted Isle^^^Acquire 6 Water Elemental Bracers for Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay.^The water elementals were no doubt summoned by Gazban, the goblin wizard rumored to have discovered the Stone of the Tides. As you may know, the Stone of the Tides curses its bearer, causing him to fade in and out of existence... Perhaps we can find a way to counteract the curse. We can have a mage of Dalaran analyze the magical residue of one of the water elemental's bracers. I need you to go back to the island and retrieve a few specimens.Magical Analysis^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Baron Revilgaz^Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver^The Haunted Isle^^Ansirem's Key^Bring the water elemental bracers to Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver in Dalaran Crater.^From what I've heard, the mages of Dalaran have succeeded in rebuilding their magical city and moving it to Northrend, leaving behind a massive crater. Some mages remained here though, who should spare some time to look at the bracers. If there's anything I know about mages, they can't resist a magical puzzle. Take the bag of water elemental bracers and see if they can shed any light on the Stone's curse. Look for the Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver. I've dealt with him before, and his knowledge is vast.Ansirem's Key^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver^Catelyn the Blade^Ansirem's Key^Magical Analysis^^Talk to Catelyn in Booty Bay.^The mage that is in possession of the Stone is amplifying its power through some focal point... an altar of some sort. You should be able to disrupt it by overpowering it. As it happens, I know just the thing: an ancient dagger, another troll relic. There's just one... little problem. You see, I found the dagger while researching in Stranglethorn, but I gave it to my willful daughter, Catelyn, who ran off to Booty Bay to become a pirate.The Bloodsail Buccaneers^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Fleet Master Seahorn^Fleet Master Seahorn^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^^Fleet Master Seahorn in Booty Bay wants you to kill 10 Bloodsail Swashbucklers and bring back the Bloodsail Charts and the Bloodsail Orders.^Crazz speaks highly of your dedication to the Blackwater Raiders. I am going to trust you with a mission of extreme importance to the fleet. Infiltrate the so-called southern command post the Bloodsail Buccaneers have established on the Wild Shore. Raid the encampment. Bring me their charts along with their written orders. We shall see exactly what those scum are up to.Singing Blue Shards^35^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Crank Fizzlebub^Crank Fizzlebub^Singing Blue Shards^^^Bring 10 Singing Crystal Shards to Crank Fizzlebub.^The Singing Crystals are unique to Stranglethorn, and are very valuable to certain parties. I can move those crystals, but the cursed Venture Company makes it hard for an honest entrepreneur like myself to gather any! I'd like to hire you. The basilisks in Stranglethorn eat the crystal. This gives them their hardened skin, and sometimes decent quality crystal can be harvested from it. You can get it from any basilisk, but the less nasty ones are along the shores south of Zul'Kunda, to the north.Scaring Shaky^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^"Shaky" Phillipe^Scaring Shaky^^^Bring 5 Mistvale Giblets to "Shaky" Phillipe in Booty Bay.^If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts! And there are a lot of people who owe me. Think you can help me collect? First, there's "Shaky" Phillipe down by the docks. He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due! But to get it, we'll have to scare him. Go out of town and hunt Elder Mistvale Gorillas. Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky. Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst.Return to MacKinley^41^All^Stranglethorn Vale^"Shaky" Phillipe^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^Scaring Shaky^^^Bring Shaky's Payment to "Sea Wolf" MacKinley.^Here, take this pouch and give it to Sea Wolf. And tell him I meant to pay him back! I swear!! I just got a little drunk and lost my way, and...you know how things are. He'll understand - you don't have to get rough!The Bloodsail Buccaneers^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Fleet Master Seahorn^Fleet Master Seahorn^The Bloodsail Buccaneers^^^Fleet-Master Seahorn in Booty Bay wants you to kill Captain Stillwater, Captain Keelhaul and Fleet Master Firallon.^Blast the nerve of Firallon! He couldn't sail a skiff through Crystal Lake let alone lead an entire fleet against us. The Bloodsail Buccaneers will pay for their carelessness. Now that we know their plan of attack, we can counter before they know what hit them. But why send the entire fleet to do the work of one brave adventuring party? <name>, take some of your most skilled comrades out to Firallon's landing spot and assassinate the Bloodsail leadership. Their fleet will sink soon after....Voodoo Dues^44^All^Stranglethorn Vale^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^Scaring Shaky^^Cracking Maury's Foot^Bring Maury's Clubbed Foot, Jon-Jon's Golden Spyglass, and Chucky's Huge Ring to "Sea Wolf" MacKinley in Booty Bay.^My list is shortening, but there are still people who owe me. Next, we have Maury "Club Foot" Wilkins, Jon-Jon the Crow, and Chucky "Ten Thumbs." These scurvy dogs' debts are months outstanding and I thought they skipped town to avoid paying up! Later, I heard they're cursed and bewitched and now wander the jungle ruins. But I don't care what their fate is - I want what's mine! They're at the Ruins of Aboraz and the Ruins of Jubuwal, northeast of here. Find them, and collect."Pretty Boy" Duncan^39^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Catelyn the Blade^Catelyn the Blade^Ansirem's Key^^^Get Catelyn's dagger from "Pretty Boy" Duncan.^My FATHER sent you? I'd have thought that old codger would have given up on me by now. It wasn't really his fault I ran off, he just shouldn't have expected I'd be willing to live a boring life, reading over musty books and associating with grey-haired, stiff-backed, stuffy mages! If you need my dagger, you'll have to get it back from "Pretty Boy" Duncan, one of the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Put something 'tween his shoulders and I'm sure he'll give it up.The Curse of the Tides^40^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Catelyn the Blade^Baron Revilgaz^Ansirem's Key^^^Destroy the Altar of the Tides with Catelyn's Blade, kill Gazban and bring the Stone of the Tides and Catelyn's Blade back to Baron Revilgaz.^So you're looking for an altar of some sort? Well, I'm no expert on troll ruins like my father, but I have heard about a sunken troll city out near that island you're looking for. Maybe you should try there. You got my knife back for me, so I guess you can borrow it... but I want it back when you're done!Cracking Maury's Foot^44^All^Stranglethorn Vale^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^^Voodoo Dues^^Bring Maury's Key to "Sea Wolf" Mackinley in Booty Bay.^Curses! That swab Maury put a lock on his foot, and I can't open it! His loot's inside the foot, and that's what he owes me! We need to find the key to open the lock. Maury was known to gamble with the Mosh'Ogg ogres, at their mound to the northeast. And he told me, when he was still alive, that the last time he went to the mound he was chased off after winning too much. Maybe the Ogres there have his key. But if they do, you might have to kill a load of them to find the right one...The Captain's Chest^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Captain Hecklebury Smotts^Captain Hecklebury Smotts^^^^Bring Smotts' Chest to Hecklebury Smotts in Booty Bay.^I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor. I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation. Until... Those cursed sea giants ruined me! They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay. And one of the giants, Gorlash, stole my Captain's Chest. He said he wanted it for a snuffbox. The nerve! I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here. Find him and get back my chest! Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude.The Haunted Isle^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Krazek^Baron Revilgaz^The Haunted Isle^^^Speak with Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay.^Baron Revilgaz has had me keep an ear out for rumors of the strange and out-of-place in Booty Bay and Stranglethorn. I don't usually put much stock in ghost stories, but I heard some sailors in the tavern talking about a haunted island off the coast. Water elementals and a raving goblin ghost, they say. If you're going to go talk to Revilgaz, could you relay that story to him?Akiris by the Bundle^43^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Privateer Bloads^Privateer Bloads^^^Akiris by the Bundle^Bring 10 Bundles of Akiris Reed to Privateer Bloads in Booty Bay.^You looking fer work, <name>? I might have some if you're up for a little challenge. I got a friend named Groy who makes a killing selling what the naga call akiris reed: it's some kind of valuable ocean reed. Not too sure what it's for, but he pays well for bundles of the stuff. Ya bring me ten stalks of the stuff, and we'll have business to do. The naga were last seen along the beach to the north of here.Facing Negolash^42^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Sprogger^Captain Hecklebury Smotts^^The Captain's Cutlass^^Bring 10 Barbecued Buzzard Wings and 5 bottles of Junglevine Wine to Captain Smotts' Lifeboat.^Negolash is a hungry giant. When the giants destroyed our ship, Negolash went straight for my kitchen. He wasn't hungry for crew like the other giants. Negolash wanted wine...and my Barbecued Buzzard Wings. They're my specialty, and I had to go all the way to the Badlands for the recipe! If you want to lure the giant, then get some wine and a heap of buzzard wings. Put them in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast. When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come for sure!Zanzil's Secret^44^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Crank Fizzlebub^Crank Fizzlebub^^^Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout^Bring 12 samples of Zanzil's Mixture to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay.^Zanzil the Outcast dwells with his followers in the Jubuwal and Aboraz Ruins, northeast of Booty Bay. He is exiled from his tribe. Why? Well... Zanzil has methods of bending the minds of others, and his leaders fear him. He uses a mixture of jungle plants on his followers to suppress their will and strengthen their bodies. His mixture would be worth much to those who wish to control others. Bring me samples of his mixture, and I will find a use for them.Return to Corporal Kaleb^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Krazek^Corporal Kaleb^Krazek's Cookery^^^Bring Krazek's Fixed Pot to Corporal Kaleb at the Rebel Camp.^While you were gone I fixed the pot you brought me. I even added an extra steam whistle, and look! There's a new chopper at the bottom that'll cut through leg bones! Yes yes, Krazek's Crock Pot is a 100% cook pleaser! I'm sure its owner will be satisfied.Akiris by the Bundle^43^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Privateer Bloads^Privateer Groy^^Akiris by the Bundle^^Bring a Bundle of Akiris Reeds to Privateer Groy in Theramore.^<name>, since I have you here, I got a message from Groy while you were gone. He mentioned bein' satisfied with the last shipment that arrived and has a client that wants some more of the stuff right away. I won't be headin' to Theramore for a week, but if you're willin' to make the journey, there's no reason you can't take the stuff for me. Feeling adventurous? You do know where Dustwallow Marsh is, doncha? I'd be careful though, Theramore can be dangerous if you're the wrong kind of crowd.Cortello's Riddle^43^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Cortello's Riddle^A Soggy Scroll^Cortello's Riddle^^^Solve the riddle!^There is an ornate, well-traveled bridgeEast of Deadwind and south of RedridgeUnderneath there waits something for youSome call it a hint, others a clueThere it will lie for endless tomorrowsBiding its time in the Swamp of SorrowsCortello's Riddle^43^All^Stranglethorn Vale^A Soggy Scroll^Musty Scroll^Cortello's Riddle^^^Solve the riddle!^A far off land in Kalimdor awaitsWhere peril has dashed hopes and fatesEast of Barrens the weather is harshGloom and danger pock Dustwallow MarshBut there lies a clue for those up to the testWaiting to be found in a cave in the southwestCortello's Riddle^51^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Musty Scroll^Cortello's Treasure^Cortello's Riddle^^^Solve the riddle!^To Lordaeron! The great land of turmoilWhere brave soldiers with death do toilFind your way through the great unrestThere you will find the end to this questAlong the coast of the Hinterlands, at the base of the great fallsUnderneath the water there does your treasure call!Favor for Krazek^37^Alliance^Stranglethorn Vale^Krazek^Krazek^Krazek's Cookery^^^Bring 4 loads of Lesser Bloodstone Ore to Krazek in Booty Bay.^There is a mountain cave in Drywhisker Gorge, far to the north in the Arathi Highlands. In that cave is rare ore: bloodstone. The bloodstone in this cave is not of the highest grade, but even low-quality bloodstone is valuable... to those with the knowledge to use it. I would like some. I will fix your crock pot, but while I work on it... bring me samples of bloodstone. Bring me enough, and I'll even give you a bonus. Oh, and if you don't have the skill to mine it... find someone who does!Excelsior^38^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Drizzlik^Drizzlik^Some Assembly Required^^^Bring an Elder Crocolisk Skin to Drizzlik in Booty Bay.^With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line. It's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder saltwater crocolisk. The elders only come out to defend the other saltwater crocs, so you might need to kill a few to draw one out.The Vile Reef^37^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Kin'weelay^Kin'weelay^^^^Bring a Tablet Shard to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.^Long ago, a great shudder of the earth sunk an old troll city beneath the waters of the Savage Coast to the northwest. We call that place the Vile Reef, for murlocs now reside in the ruins of the city, attacking any who draw close. There is an old tablet among those ruins that tells the ancient tale of Gri'lek, a hero of troll legends. The tale is sacred to the Darkspear tribe, and although the tablet is too large to move, I want a shard of it to enshrine in our new home in Orgrimmar.Message in a Bottle^42^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Princess Poobah^Princess Poobah^Message in a Bottle^^^Slay King Mukla and return to Princess Poobah with the Key to free her.^<name>, I put my faith in you and anyone you can muster to help free me. The great Skymane King Mukla is my captor. He commands the beasts of this island, and they keep me here against my will with the aid of this chain. If you can slay him and find the key to this shackle, I shall be indebted to you greatly. I often hear him to the southeast side of the island, but please be careful: he is not to be trifled with.The Thandol Span^31^Alliance^Wetlands^Rhag Garmason^Ebenezer Rustlocke's Corpse^The Thandol Span^^^Rhag Garmason wants you to locate Ol' Rustlocke.^A tremendous explosion roared through the hills. 'Twas horrible, I tell you! Good soldiers died defending the Thandol Span. Longbraid says we'll take revenge on the Dark Irons before all is said and done. We're in a world of hurt though and I don't see any reinforcements in sight. Longbraid sent Ol' Rustlocke to scout the eastern bridge to see if we could secure it. That was days ago. We haven't the manpower to search for him with Dun Modr under siege. Perhaps you can find him...The Thandol Span^31^Alliance^Wetlands^Ebenezer Rustlocke's Corpse^Rhag Garmason^The Thandol Span^^^Report back to Rhag Garmason at Dun Modir in Wetlands and show him the parchment you found on Rustlocke's corpse.^It seems as though poor Ol' Rustlocke ran into a Dark Iron ambush. You notice a parchment next to his clenched fist. Report the grim news to Rhag Garmason and show him what you found.The Thandol Span^31^Alliance^Wetlands^Rhag Garmason^Rhag Garmason^The Thandol Span^^^Destroy the cache of explosives.^Heavens no! Poor Rustlocke. 'Tis quite a tragedy indeed. We must not let his death pass in vain. This parchment you discovered indicates that Kam Deepfury, the mastermind behind the original attack, arranged for a cache of explosives to be stashed just across the Thandol Span, in Arathi Highlands. If those explosives make it to the bridge, our major supply line to the north will be severed! The cache must be destroyed, <name>! Return to me when your mission is complete. You're our only hope.Plea To The Alliance^31^Alliance^Wetlands^Rhag Garmason^Captain Nials^The Thandol Span^^^Seek out Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe in Arathi Highlands.^I ask of you one more small favor, <class>. We await the reserves of Ironforge. However, Roggo has knowledge of an Alliance camp to the north in Arathi Highlands at Refuge Pointe. Travel there and seek out Captain Nials. Ask the good Captain if the Alliance can spare some soldiers to help us reclaim Dun Modr and the Thandol Span.Crystal in the Mountains^35^All^Arathi Highlands^Pendant of Myzrael^Shards of Myzrael^^^^Find the crystal from your vision.^This shard pulses as you hold it... You feel a sense of pleading coming from the shard, as if someone is trying to communicate, someone who desperately needs your help. A vision appears in your mind - of the northern mountains of Arathi, and of a brilliant crystal jutting from the earth there. You feel drawn to that place.Sully Balloo's Letter^30^Alliance^Ironforge^Waterlogged Envelope^Sara Balloo^^^Sara Balloo's Plea^Deliver Sully Balloo's Letter to Sara Balloo.^The waterlogged and war-torn envelope dissolves in your hands, leaving you with a few pages of a letter in your grasp, written with painstaking care. The letter is addressed to a Mrs. Sara Balloo of Ironforge and begins, "My dear Sara...."Trollbane^37^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Nimboya^Zengu^Trollbane^^^Travel to Hammerfall in the Arathi Highlands and speak with Zengu.^With Thoras Trollbane dead and Stromgarde in ruins, Vol'jin has instructed that we make every effort to spirit the legendary sword Trol'kalar from the humans' hands, so that we might use it in our coming battles against the trolls of Zul'Gurub. Zengu, one of our seasoned hunters, was dispatched to Hammerfall in northeastern Arathi Highlands to oversee its procurement.Sigil of Strom^37^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Zengu^Zengu^Trollbane^^^Get the Sigil of Strom for Zengu in Hammerfall.^In ancient times, trolls fought against the Arathorian Empire and our most capable adversary, Lord Ignaeus of Strom, named Trollbane. He rode into battle wielding Trol'kalar--troll slayer, in their ancient tongue. But now the sons of Trollbane are weakened, their stronghold brought to ruin. The sword is protected by several sigils that were divided among the survivors of Stromgarde, and we must retrieve them. The first was taken by the Syndicate, one of their men in Stromgarde should have it.The Broken Sigil^40^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Zengu^Tor'gan^Trollbane^^Sigil of Thoradin^Retrieve the 5 Sigil Fragments from the defenders in Stromgarde, and bring them to Tor'gan in Hammerfall.^Thoras Trollbane's tomb is protected by three sigils--the first of which you retrieved from the Syndicate. The other two will be harder to get, as they're held by the firmly entrenched Stromgarde militia. The sigil of Thoradin was divided into five pieces by Thoras' son, Galen, and dispersed among the Stromgarde defenders. Retrieve the pieces and bring them to Tor'gan, the troll shaman, he will be able to bind them into the complete sigil.Sigil of Thoradin^40^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Zengu^Sigil of Thoradin^The Broken Sigil^^Bring the restored Sigil of Thoradin to Zengu in Hammerfall.^The reconstruction worked flawlessly. The sigil can now be used to unlock the seal on Trollbane's tomb. Return it to Zengu, no doubt he has additional tasks for you to complete.The Princess Trapped^37^All^Arathi Highlands^Shards of Myzrael^Iridescent Shards^The Princess Trapped^^^Gather 12 Motes of Myzrael, then bring them to the Iridescent Shards in Drywhisker Gorge.^My name is Myzrael. I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the giants, have trapped me deep beneath the Arathi Highlands. These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world. Please help me. Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker Kobolds, have a shard like this one in their Drywhisker Gorge, to the east. To power the cluster, you must gather Motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it. I beg you, <name>, aid me!Sigil of Arathor^41^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Zengu^Zengu^Sigil of Thoradin^^^Retrieve the Sigil of Arathor and return it to Zengu in Hammerfall.^Though they can barely be said to control Stromgarde, let alone the whole of Arathi Highlands, the human prince trots the remnants of his cavalry over the countryside. I can't understand why he does it, but who understands the way the humans think, hm? Whatever his reasoning, more importantly, he has given one of the sigils to Lieutenant Valorcall, their cavalry leader. Locate him and bring his sigil back to me.Sigil of Trollbane^42^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Zengu^Zengu^Sigil of Thoradin^^^Kill Prince Galen Trollbane and bring the Sigil of Trollbane to Zengu in Hammerfall.^The final of the sigils needed to unlock the tomb of Thoras Trollbane is held by his son personally. He resides deep within Stromgarde, in a chapel in the militia-held districts. Prince Galen is well protected and no slouch of a warrior himself, so this task could prove most difficult.Trol'kalar^42^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Zengu^Trollbane's Tomb^Sigil of Thoradin^^^Retrieve Trol'kalar from Trollbane's tomb in Stromgarde.^What's this? With the four sigils brought together, they have formed together to create one sigil. There can be no doubt that this will be able to break the wardings placed upon Trollbane's tomb. Trollbane's remains are entombed in the Sanctum behind the chapel in Stromgarde. Retrieve Trol'kalar.Trol'kalar^42^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Trollbane's Tomb^Zengu^Sigil of Thoradin^^^Deliver Trol'kalar to Zengu in Hammerfall.^The light slowly fades, the sword Trol'kalar, held within a stone sheath has been released.MacKreel's Moonshine^30^Alliance^Wetlands^Foggy MacKreel^Brewmeister Bilger^^^^Take MacKreel's Moonshine to Brewmeister Bilger in Southshore.^Had quite a bit of the ol' Moonshine last night! Longbraid would have my head if he knew that I passed out during my watch. The noggin hurts something fierce. Felt as though a whole brigade of siege engines passed overhead, all that rumbling. Oh my, look at the time! I promised Brewmeister Bilger in Southshore that I'd repay my debt to him by sending some Moonshine. But there are just 15 minutes left before I'm overdue! Take him this batch, would you please? And hurry!Rescue OOX-17/TN!^48^All^Tanaris^Homing Robot OOX-17/TN^Oglethorpe Obnoticus^Find OOX-17/TN!^^An OOX of Your Own^Escort OOX-17/TN to safety, then report to Oglethorpe Obnoticus in Booty Bay.^The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot: "I need to move OOX-17/TN to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure. It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again. I need you to escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, near the Caverns of Time! That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things on line!" "Escort it safely and then come talk to me in Booty Bay! Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"Ripple Recovery^48^All^Orgrimmar^Dran Droffers^Malton Droffers^Ripple Recovery^^^Talk to Malton Droffers in Orgrimmar.^I've got some salvage work for you, and if you're an aficionado of fine ripple like I am, then you'll love this task. Ripple! It's a drink, you dummy. An abandoned Horde outpost has a stash of Hinterlands Honey Ripple from when they were in business. You can't get fine ripple like that anymore! One of Malton's dummy associates knows the shot, so you'll go out there and bring me a case of packaged ripple, and two for my own collection! Talk to Malton, he'll fill you in on the details.Ripple Recovery^48^All^Orgrimmar^Malton Droffers^Gilveradin Sunchaser^Ripple Recovery^^^Talk to Gilveradin Sunchaser; his camp is located in the Hinterlands.^The elf you will need to talk to is Gilveradin Sunchaser. He can name any wine, vintage and all, just by smell alone! He can package up the ripple we need, so you'll need to talk with him. We need six bottles for packaging, two for dad, and how ever many he'll want... and believe me, he'll want some. When you've packaged the ripple and got dad's two bottles, come back here! Gilveradin's camp is near some high elf lodge in the Hinterlands, and those high elves are not good. Trust me.Stones of Binding^38^All^Arathi Highlands^Iridescent Shards^Stone of Inner Binding^The Princess Trapped^^^Gather the Burning Key, the Cresting Key and the Thundering Key from the Stone of West Binding, the Stone of East Binding and the Stone of Outer Binding.^Four Stones of Binding are scattered throughout Arathi. These stones keep me pinned beneath the earth. To unlock them you must unlock the strongest: the Stone of Inner Binding. And to do that, you must gather keys from the other three. These stones are watched by guardians, but if you are clever, or lucky, you may find ways to banish them.Breaking the Keystone^42^All^Arathi Highlands^Stone of Inner Binding^Keystone^The Princess Trapped^^Myzrael's Allies, Myzrael's Allies^Find and kill Fozruk. Bring the Rod of Order to the Keystone in the Arathi Highlands.^Opening the Stones of Binding loosened much of my confinement, but a lock still holds me chained. It is the Keystone you see among this circle of stones. And the key is held by one of my captors, the stone watcher Fozruk. You must obtain that key, which the stone watchers call the Rod of Order, from Fozruk and use it to open the Keystone. <name>, you have done so much to aid me. Just a little more...and my gratitude will shake the very foundations of the earth!Myzrael's Allies^40^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Keystone^Gerrig Bonegrip^Myzrael's Allies^Breaking the Keystone^Theldurin the Lost^Speak with Gerrig Bonegrip in the Forlorn Cavern of Ironforge.^<Myzrael speaks.> Free! I AM FREE! I am free to gather strength, hidden from my captors. For if they faced me now they would surely overpower and again imprison me. But in time I will confront the giants, and they will regret their wardship of me! You are a noble ally, <name>. I will need your help again in time. When I am ready, I will need you to summon me to the surface. Speak with Gerrig Bonegrip. He is in Ironforge, in a shop of the Forlorn Cavern. He knows how I can be summoned.Tanaris Field Sampling^46^Horde^Tanaris^Model 4711-FTZ Power Source^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Tanaris Field Sampling^Slake That Thirst^^Acquire untested samples for 8 basilisks, 8 hyenas, and 8 scorpions. Bring the testing kit back to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle in Gadgetzan before the power source runs out.^Activating the power source makes the field testing kit start to glow and vibrate. It would seem to be working as planned. I will have it shipped immediately. According to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle, you now have some time to collect the data you need in the Tanaris desert. Return to him when you have completed the task.Hammerfall^34^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Gor'mul^Tor'gan^Hammerfall^^^Speak with Tor'gan in Hammerfall.^It is still clear to me, like yesterday... So many years without hope, with wood and steel to bind me to this terrible place. Then finally, finally! There was the Warchief. Doomhammer in his midnight plate, his warhammer held high. It was... too terrible... That the blow of a coward would strike down our greatest hero. From behind he charged on his horse, and then his lance ran him through... I fell to my knees. What hope was there? What hope is there...Summoning the Princess^50^All^Arathi Highlands^Theldurin the Lost^Shards of Myzrael^^The Lost Fragments^^Go to the Shards of Myzrael, summon her and defeat her.^You must defeat Myzrael before she grows in strength. If you do not, then once she has gathered enough power she will challenge her captors! There are some who think they can control her, but if she can be controlled then why did the giants chain her in the first place?? Crazy logic, eh? To defeat her, summon her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her. Defeat her and gather her Eldritch Shackles, then bind them to the Shards of Myzrael. Do that, and she will again be trapped.Hints of a New Plague?^36^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Quae^Kinelory^Hints of a New Plague?^^Hints of a New Plague?^Speak to Kinelory near Go'Shek Farm in Arathi Highlands.^<Quae begins to go through the folder.> This IS interesting. Seems Apothecary Jorell has been working on some deadly experiments here at Go'Shek. Not sure what that has to do with Hillsbrad, but Phin wouldn't like it if we let it continue. We had a run-in with some orcs while you were gone, and I'm not in good enough shape to help Kinelory. If you're up for it, she's going to need some protection when she goes down to the farm to steal whatever research Jorell still hasn't sent to Tarren Mill.Hints of a New Plague?^36^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Quae^Quae^Hints of a New Plague?^^^Find the Forsaken Courier and bring back her Sealed Folder to Quae near the Go'Shek Farm.^So, Phin sent you to check on us? Not surprised--he worries too much. We've been watching the farm for days, and Kin claims she saw a courier come out of that small house to the south not long ago. She talks a lot, but I can always trust her senses when we're in dangerous areas. You wouldn't happen to be a skilled tracker, would you? We think the courier might be carrying notes to Tarren Mill. If we could get our hands on those documents, it might shed some light on what's happening in Hillsbrad.Hints of a New Plague?^33^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Phin Odelic^Quae^Hints of a New Plague?^^^Find Quae and Kinelory near the Go'Shek Farm in the Arathi Highlands.^Hail, and well met, <name>. I lead a group of adventurers investigating odd happenings in this area. My cousin in Hillsbrad recently put down his dog Stanley because the animal mystically grew to an immense size and savagely attacked anyone who came near him. I believe the undead are involved, and we're looking for signs to prove as much. Two of my companions, Quae and Kinelory, headed to the Go'Shek Farm in the Arathi Highlands, and haven't checked in for days. Find them for me? I grow concerned.Hints of a New Plague?^37^All^Hillsbrad Foothills^Kinelory^Quae^Hints of a New Plague?^Hints of a New Plague?^^Protect Kinelory until she returns to Quae.^All right, <name>. I'm ready if you are. Shall we?Hints of a New Plague?^37^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Quae^Phin Odelic^Hints of a New Plague?^^^Find Phin Odelic at Southshore in Hillsbrad Foothills.^I've seen Kinelory look way worse after a night in the tavern than she does now. You obviously did a good job protecting her. These items she brought back from the farm should at least let Phin get an idea of what's going on out here in Arathi. Just to make sure there's no retaliation after your attack, we're going to stay here for a bit longer. Would you be willing to head back to Southshore and talk to Phin?Deep Sea Salvage^40^All^Arathi Highlands^First Mate Nilzlix^First Mate Nilzlix^^Land Ho!^^First Mate Nilzlix wants you to retrieve the Charts and Logs from the Maiden's Folly and the Spirit of Silverpine.^O'Breen led the ships into the cove. We were certain this is where the treasure could be found. The Harbinger docked safely but as the Maiden's Folly and Spirit of Silverpine approached the tides began to lower. Strangest thing I've ever seen! Those two ships ran aground into something... some sort of temple in the reef. They sank so quickly, was quite a tragedy. We need to retrieve their Logs as well as their Charts before we leave. We can't leave that information behind for prying eyes!Land Ho!^35^All^Arathi Highlands^Lolo the Lookout^Shakes O'Breen^^^Deep Sea Salvage, Drowned Sorrows, Sunken Treasure^Talk to Captain O'Breen at Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands.^Lolo sees a tiny <race>! Always on the lookout, Lolo is! Welcome to Faldir's Cove. Captain O'Breen said we'd only be here for a few hours. Just long enough to gather the treasure and get back to Booty Bay. But Lolo thinks we're going to be here a lot longer than that. We lost the other two ships from our formation. Poor Spirit of Silverpine and Maiden's Folly. On the bottom of the sea they rest now! Lolo suggests you talk to Captain O'Breen if you plan on sticking around here.Drowned Sorrows^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Captain Steelgut^Captain Steelgut^^Land Ho!^^Captain Steelgut in Faldir's Cove wants you to kill 10 Daggerspine Raiders and 3 Daggerspine Sorceresses.^Argh, 'tis a horrible life. I should be in a watery grave right now, not sittin' here by the fire, breathin' fresh air. The crew tried so hard to save my beautiful Maiden's Folly. Bless the boys, bless their hearts. O'Breen made it to shore safely but we weren't so lucky. The seas just sank on us, I swear. One second we're afloat and the next water is rushin' in. And those beasts! Killed all the survivors. Horrible naga scum. I went black and ended up here, saved. I want those beasts dead.Sunken Treasure^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Professor Phizzlethorpe^Doctor Draxlegauge^Sunken Treasure^Land Ho!^^Escort Professor Phizzlethorpe to the cave and back.^Now that we are full-fledged Blackwater Raiders it is our job to help Mr. O'Breen locate the lost elven treasure. It is next to impossible to find the gems in the dark sea without aid. The doctor has constructed some goggles that will help. He needs the goggles charged with the energy derived from the enchanted stone in the cave just up the hill. But the cave is cursed! When we get close, we get ambushed. Defend me and I can harness the energy from the stone into the goggles.Sunken Treasure^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Doctor Draxlegauge^Doctor Draxlegauge^Sunken Treasure^^^Doctor Draxlegauge in Faldir's Cove wants you to collect 10 Elven Gems and return the Goggles of Gem Hunting once you are done.^The treasure has been on the sea floor so long that the gems have calcified into thick stone. But the power harnessed in these goggles will allow you to locate them easily. A little gnomish ingenuity goes a long way! So borrow the Goggles of Gem Hunting, <name>, and see if you can collect some of the lost treasure for Captain O'Breen. I'd swim down there myself but...um...well, I have important scientific business to tend to up on the safe, dry land....er, yeah.Death From Below^44^All^Arathi Highlands^Shakes O'Breen^Shakes O'Breen^^Sunken Treasure^^Protect Shakes O'Breen during the attack.^This is bad. It seems the Daggerspines are amassing for an attack. Naga are known for their ruthlessness in battle. They will keep attacking until I am dead. I don't value my own life above that of my crew members, but you must help to defend me. The crew will not be able to make it back to Booty Bay without my knowledge of the seas. The naga will be coming from the sea. I need you to remain up here with me to fend off the attack. Man the cannon and drive them back. Are you ready, <name>?Sunken Treasure^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Doctor Draxlegauge^Shakes O'Breen^Sunken Treasure^^^Take the Elven Gems to Captain O'Breen at Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands.^Let's not leave Captain O'Breen waiting. He'll want to see these gems first hand. After all, that's why we're here! And after a few weeks of consorting with these pirates, the professor and I have realized the last thing that's good for our health is to be caught hanging on to their treasure. Here, <name>, take these to O'Breen.Sunken Treasure^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Shakes O'Breen^Fleet Master Seahorn^Sunken Treasure^^^Take the Sample Elven Gem to Fleet Master Seahorn at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.^Fleet Master Seahorn will want to hear about our find at once. But as you can see, we're not in much of a position to get out of here. Not only is the tide too low, but those damned creatures we disrupted are keeping a close eye on our movements. You can be of great service to the Blackwater Raiders if you can get word to Fleet Master Seahorn in Booty Bay that we discovered the treasure and are working on extracting more. Take him this sample as proof.Sunken Treasure^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Fleet Master Seahorn^Shakes O'Breen^Sunken Treasure^^Death From Below^Deliver Seahorn's Letter to Shakes O'Breen at Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands.^Say, <name>, you seem to be an adventurous type. My fleet is stuck in Booty Bay until we can restock. There are some heavy things brewing here and abroad and I need to get some top secret correspondence to Shakes O'Breen who is tied up off the Arathi coast. Can I trust you to deliver this message safely and in confidence?Foul Magics^33^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Tor'gan^^^Foul Magics^Get 10 Bloodstone Amulets for Tor'gan in Hammerfall.^I have felt a strangeness in the air... a feeling that simmers in my blood. I had my suspicions. I set off to find the source of my unease and discovered to the west, at Northfold Manor, the residual traces of demonic summoning. As I got close, my blood began to boil and the rage within me grew. On the ground I spied an amulet of bloodstone, used to assist in demonic summoning. The one I found was depleted, however. I'll need another to examine, but I dare not return to the manor. Can you bring me some?Raising Spirits^34^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Tor'gan^Hammerfall^^^Acquire 10 Highland Raptor Eyes from Highland Striders and Highland Thrashers for Tor'gan in Hammerfall.^We tried to settle him in, cheer him up, telling him stories of our mighty city at Orgrimmar in Kalimdor, but nothing would move him. Tales of our young Warchief, Thrall, who bears the armor and hammer of Orgrim... but, perhaps... Perhaps! A demonstration of our newly found shamanistic magic would give him new hope. It is worth a try! A small object we could make for him, yes... Bring me some raptor eyes, and I will see what I can do.Foul Magics^40^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Tor'gan^^Foul Magics^^Retrieve Marez Cowl's Bloodstone Orb and bring it to Tor'gan in Hammerfall.^There is no doubt in my mind that a powerful warlock resides within the walls of Stromgarde. From time to time, using an arcane magical relic, this warlock has summoned forth terrible demons in large numbers. We must remove the source of his energy. Find the warlock and kill him. Bring me whatever magical object you find on his person, and I will take steps to destroy it and see that its power is not used to taint this land any longer.Raising Spirits^34^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Gor'mul^Hammerfall^^^Give the Raptor Talon Amulet to Gor'mul at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.^Here, take this amulet to Gor'mul, and see if the raptors' strength can awaken the flame of the warrior that once burned through his veins.Raising Spirits^34^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Gor'mul^Tor'gan^Hammerfall^^^Speak with Tor'gan at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.^<Gor'mul tosses the amulet into the ground.> Tor'gan sent you, didn't he? Pah! Why he feels some mercy towards me I would not understand. Mercy was denied me when I was not allowed to die with my Warchief in battle. A cruel blow fate has dealt me...The Hammer May Fall^32^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^Tallow^Drum Fel^The Hammer May Fall^^^Kill 8 Boulderfist Ogres and 10 Boulderfist Enforcers, then find Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost in Arathi Highlands.^Weaklings... all of them. You, <class>, what are you looking at? Think you're something special, huh? Why not prove it? The Hammerfall outpost in Arathi's under attack. Unless we send them help soon, their demise is imminent. But before you go rushing off, you may want to test your skills first. Northeast of Stromgarde in Arathi is an ogre mound inhabited by the Boulderfist tribe. When you can handle the ogres and enforcers there, then report to Drum Fel in Hammerfall.Call to Arms^32^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Drum Fel^Drum Fel^The Hammer May Fall^^^Slay 10 Witherbark Axe Throwers, 10 Headhunters and 8 Witch Doctors, and return to Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost.^The Witherbark trolls and Boulderfist ogres of Arathi are working together to rid us from this land, but we shall not meet our fates at their, or anyone else's, hand. We will slay them and show them that we, too, have a home here. The trolls turned their backs to us; the ogres would use us for food and bedding if we allowed them to--these things shall not be. We start our attack on the Witherbark trolls to the south of here. Slay them in droves, and only return when their camps run thick with blood.Call to Arms^38^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Drum Fel^Drum Fel^The Hammer May Fall^^The Real Threat^Kill 10 Boulderfist Brutes and 4 Boulderfist Magi, and return to Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost.^Your strength is evident, <name>. Now to see how you fare against a real enemy. The Boulderfists have a lair to the southwest of here towards the dwarven bridge, and, if I'm not mistaken, the maulers and magi there shall present to you a greater challenge--they have done so to us thus far. Slay as many as you can and come to me in body when you are successful, or come to me in spirit when you fail. I shall give praise to your tenacity in battle either way.Call to Arms^40^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Drum Fel^Drum Fel^The Hammer May Fall^^^Kill 7 Boulderfist Shaman and 3 Boulderfist Lords and return to Drum Fel in the Hammerfall outpost.^The head of the beast is ready to be taken off... with great force, <name>. You have shown every sign that you are able to help us with this final mighty blow. The leaders of these attacks have made their lair within the ruins of Stromgarde, a glaring symbol of human frailty. Find and slay those Boulderfist lords and their lackey shaman who would try and drive us from these lands.The Real Threat^40^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Korin Fel^Korin Fel^^Call to Arms^^Slay Or'Kalar and bring his Head to Korin Fel in the Hammerfall outpost.^You serve my husband well, <class>, but he does not know why Hammerfall is under attack. Or'Kalar, Mug'thol's pawn in Stromgarde, has an intense hatred for my husband, and wishes nothing more than my husband's death for defeating him years ago. My auguries tell me that Or'Kalar has laid a trap for my husband, so I have hidden signs of the ogre's presence from him. My husband will rush off foolishly if he learns of the ogre's whereabouts and I would ask for your help in slaying the creature.Northfold Manor^31^All^Arathi Highlands^Captain Nials^Captain Nials^^^Stromgarde Badges^Kill 10 Syndicate Highwaymen and 6 Syndicate Mercenaries.^We are fighting a war for Stromgarde, and we are losing. The ogres, the Syndicate and we have divided our once great city, and each faction battles the other into a bloody stalemate. But our forces dwindle while our enemy grows. We need help from the town of Southshore, but supplies are difficult to receive while the Syndicate holds territory between us. Go to the Syndicate base in Northfold Manor and slay them. Then, perhaps, pressure on our supply trains will lessen and more will get through.Stromgarde Badges^37^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Captain Nials^Captain Nials^^Northfold Manor^^Bring 7 Stromgarde Badges to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe.^The Syndicate in Stromgarde do battle with our contingent of militia there. In order to urge the rabble to fight our more disciplined troops, the Syndicate leaders have placed a bounty on our soldiers, awarding gold for each Stromgarde Badge gathered off killed militiamen. We want those badges retrieved - we cannot allow the cutthroats to take trophies from our brave fallen! Enter the Syndicate-controlled area of Stromgarde and hunt them for our badges.Sara Balloo's Plea^30^Alliance^Ironforge^Sara Balloo^King Magni Bronzebeard^^Sully Balloo's Letter^A King's Tribute^Take Sara Balloo's note to King Magni Bronzebeard of Ironforge.^<name>, I have but a small request to ask of you. Take this note I have prepared to our great monarch of Ironforge, King Magni Bronzebeard. 'Tis a small task to ask of one such as yourself, someone who has shown great valor to the cause of the Alliance thus far. For me to go before the King in my grief-ridden state would not serve the purpose of my cause. Surely you understand.Wanted! Marez Cowl^39^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Wanted Board^Captain Nials^^^^Bring Marez's head to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe.^A bounty has been placed on the head of Marez Cowl, a high-level advisor and operative of the Syndicate. She was last seen within the Syndicate controlled territory of Stromgarde. Bounty may be collected from Captain Nials. Be warned: Marez is a skilled and cunning Warlock, known for her trafficking with demons. Extreme caution is advised when hunting her.Wanted! Otto and Falconcrest^40^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Wanted Board^Captain Nials^^^^Bring Otto's Head and Falconcrest's Head to Captain Nials at Refuge Pointe.^The Stromgarde Militia has placed bounties on the heads of Lord Falconcrest, and his bodyguard Otto. Falconcrest heads the Syndicate's efforts in the Arathi Highlands, and his death would cause a major disruption in those efforts. His bodyguard Otto, although not a strategic target, is a fierce opponent and has killed dozens of our defenders. Their bounties may be collected from Captain Nials.A King's Tribute^30^Alliance^Ironforge^King Magni Bronzebeard^Grand Mason Marblesten^A King's Tribute^Sara Balloo's Plea^^King Magni Bronzebeard wants you to speak with Grand Mason Marblesten.^I do not expect good dwarves like Mrs. Balloo to understand why the travesties of war must be endured for the greater good of our people. The loss of her husband, and the loss of every dwarf that fights in the name of the Alliance, weighs heavy on my soul. While I cannot bring her husband back from the Twisting Nether, I can pay tribute to him. I am going to commission a memorial to Sully Balloo to be built by Grand Mason Marblesten. Send word to him now, <class>. You shall be custodian of my bidding.Theldurin the Lost^40^All^Arathi Highlands^Gerrig Bonegrip^Theldurin the Lost^Myzrael's Allies^^^Find Theldurin the Lost.^Theldurin the Lost was once a member of our order, the Twilight's Hammer. But he lost his mind and scorned our teachings. And before he fled from us, he stole the scroll of Myzrael! We could not catch him, but rumors say he hides in the Badlands, gibbering and mad. To bring the Lady back to us, you must find the scroll. And to do that, you must find Theldurin.Myzrael's Allies^40^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Keystone^Zaruk^Myzrael's Allies^Breaking the Keystone^Theldurin the Lost^Speak with Zaruk at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.^<Myzrael speaks.> Free! I AM FREE! I am free to gather strength, hidden from my captors. For if they faced me now they would surely overpower and again imprison me. But in time I will confront the giants, and they will regret their wardship of me! You are a noble ally, <name>. I will need your help again in time. When I am ready, I will need you to summon me to the surface Speak with Zaruk in Hammerfall. He knows how I can be summoned.A King's Tribute^31^Alliance^Ironforge^Grand Mason Marblesten^Grand Mason Marblesten^A King's Tribute^^A King's Tribute^Grand Mason Marblesten of Ironforge wants 5 pieces of Alterac Granite.^So our good King would like a memorial built in honor of a soldier named Sully Balloo? And you say the poor chap died during the Thandol Span tragedy? Bah, will there ever be peace on Azeroth? Nonetheless, any commission from the King is of utmost importance. To build a truly epic and lasting piece I want to work with one of the finest stones available. Travel to Darrow Hill in Hillsbrad and gather for me some Alterac Granite.Malin's Request^32^Alliance^Stormwind City^Archmage Malin^Skuerto^^^Worth Its Weight in Gold^Find Skuerto at Refuge Pointe in the Arathi Highlands.^Greetings, <name>. You have the look of an adventurer about you, and I have a task that needs some tending to. Archmage Trelane, my original master, fled Stromgarde in the Arathi Highlands not too long ago, and he's asked me to help him in recovering some of the items he left behind. The city fell under siege, and he attempted to defend the Tower of Arathor, but to no avail. I have agents in the Highlands already, but they've requested I send more aid. Are you interested?Worth Its Weight in Gold^36^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Apprentice Kryten^Apprentice Kryten^^Malin's Request^Wand over Fist^Find 10 Witherbark Tusks, 4 Witherbark Medicine Pouches and a Shadow Hunter Knife for Apprentice Kryten at Refuge Pointe.^Archmage Malin sent Skuerto and I here to collect reagents for him. I was at a loss as to how I was going to collect the items, but now that you're here, I think my problem's solved. I need the following: Witherbark tusks, Witherbark medicine pouches and a shadow hunter knife. Could you find those for me? The Witherbark live to the southeast of Arathi.The Lost Fragments^41^All^Badlands^Theldurin the Lost^Theldurin the Lost^Myzrael's Allies^^Summoning the Princess^Bring the Torn Scroll Fragment, the Crumpled Scroll Fragment and the Singed Scroll Fragment to Theldurin the Lost.^The Scroll of Myzrael...the Scroll of Myzrael?! You don't want that! Its magic can pull Myzrael to the surface world and if you do that, we are in trouble! Or...maybe it's too late. Maybe she already is free. Maybe she's just gathering strength before unleashing herself upon us. If so, then you'll NEED the scroll! ...too bad it's destroyed. Enraged elementals stole it and tore it up and now fight over the fragments. But if you can gather those fragments, maybe we can fix it...Wand over Fist^39^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Skuerto^Skuerto^^Worth Its Weight in Gold^Trelane's Defenses^Find Trelane's Wand of Invocation and return it to Skuerto at Refuge Pointe.^Hey, <name>. Sorry to be so short with ye earlier... and no, that ain't a pun. I figured out where Trelane's first item ended up: Kor'gresh has it in Boulderfist Hall. An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers. Boulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand. While you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde.Trelane's Defenses^39^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Skuerto^Apprentice Kryten^Trelane's Defenses^Wand over Fist^^Find an Azure Agate and bring it to Apprentice Kryten at Refuge Pointe.^All rested? Here's our next step: there're ogres all around the Tower of Arathor in Stromgarde. We're gonna need to activate the tower's defenses if you're gonna stand a chance against 'em an' still make it to the items alive. To do that, we're gonna need some gems the Boulderfist shaman have taken a liking to. They took 'em from the tower, but they're not gonna stay in their possession for long. Get one of them gems an' bring 'em to Kryten--he knows the spell to enchant 'em so they'll work as a key.An Apprentice's Enchantment^39^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Apprentice Kryten^Skuerto^Trelane's Defenses^^^Speak to Skuerto at Refuge Pointe in Arathi Highlands.^Here you are, <name>. The gem only needs to be pressed against one of the pedestals near the base of the tower to activate its defenses. Use it when you're ready to enter the tower and find Trelane's remaining items. Good luck to you. I'll be awaiting your return here at the camp. Oh, and speak to Skuerto before you leave. He'll give you the rest of the details you'll need.Attack on the Tower^39^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Skuerto^Skuerto^Trelane's Defenses^^^Find Trelane's Phylactery, Trelane's Orb, and Trelane's Ember Agate, and return them to Skuerto at Refuge Pointe.^Here's what your lookin' for: Trelane's phylactery, Trelane's orb, an' Trelane's ember agate. All three should be in chests within the tower an' you shouldn't have a problem opening the chests on your own; you just have to be careful of the ogres. The tower's defenses won't take care of 'em on their own; you'll need to have your weapons at the ready. Those ogres find out you're there and stealing from 'em, an' they'll be sure to put the hurt on you. Be careful, an' good luck.Malin's Request^39^Alliance^Arathi Highlands^Skuerto^Archmage Malin^Trelane's Defenses^^^Take the Sealed Letter to Archmage Malin in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.^Take this letter back to Stormwind and let Malin know that Kryten an' I'll be home soon. He'll reward you well for helping us here, <name>, of that I've no doubt. Travel safely.Lack of Surplus^40^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Dar^Tok'Kar^Lack of Surplus^^^Bring 8 Unprepared Sawtooth Flanks to Tok'Kar in Swamp of Sorrows.^I'm working on getting some supplies together for our outpost near the beach to the east--Tok'kar does what he can, but between shifts of guard duty and cooking for his soldiers there's not much time left in the day. They do enjoy cooking up some sawtooth meat when they can, but I haven't had time to get them another shipment. Would you mind helping them out? The young sawtooths aren't as tasty as the older ones, so stay clear of those; give them a year or two to get to full size.Lack of Surplus^42^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Tok'Kar^Tok'Kar^Lack of Surplus^^^Bring 6 Sawtooth Snapper Claws to Tok'Kar in the Swamp of Sorrows.^With the threat of murlocs along the coast, we're stationed out here to protect--or warn if the force is too large--of any coming threats to Stonard. It doesn't give us much time for relaxation, and we could use some more help if you're able. The sawtooth snappers' claws make for fine weapons when properly prepared. Bring me some of their claws and I'll see you're rewarded with one of our weapons in thanks for the fresh meat and the good company.A King's Tribute^31^Alliance^Ironforge^Grand Mason Marblesten^King Magni Bronzebeard^^A King's Tribute^^Report to King Magni Bronzebeard.^Ah, such fine stone comes from Lordaeron. Such a shame the land is in such shambles. But the Memorial came out quite well! I should think the King will be most pleased with it. Now if you will, please send word to His Majesty that the Memorial is complete as requested.Guile of the Raptor^37^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Tor'gan^Hammerfall^^^Acquire 12 Raptor Hearts from Highland Fleshstalkers for Tor'gan.^With some additional objects, I will be able to create an item that will imbue Gor'mul with the guile of the raptor! With the power of the raptor flowing through him, Gor'mul will know our new power and rediscover the warrior that lies dormant! I will require raptor hearts to fashion the item and spell.Guile of the Raptor^37^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Tor'gan^Gor'mul^Hammerfall^^Guile of the Raptor^Give Tor'gan's Orb to Gor'mul at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.^Take this orb and use its energy to give Gor'mul the essence of the raptor. Surely this will invigorate his spirit and give him new purpose in life. With him returned to normal, we can explain to him the current state of the Horde, and we will have a great warrior's assistance in our unceasing battles.Barbecued Buzzard Wings^40^All^Badlands^Rigglefuzz^Rigglefuzz^^^^Bring 4 Buzzard Wings to Rigglefuzz.^Oh yes, my barbecued buzzard wings are a favorite! The sauce is rich and the meat is tangy. And the smell will bring the hungry running from miles away! I have everything I need to cook up a batch. Everything...except the buzzard wings! If you want some then get me the buzzard wings. Bring me enough, and I might even share the recipe with you!Agmond's Fate^38^Alliance^Loch Modan^Prospector Ironband^Prospector Ironband^Ironband Wants You!^^^Bring 4 Carved Stone Urns to Prospector Ironband in Loch Modan.^The last report I received from Agmond is troubling, more so now that he's dead! He mentioned that his diggers uncovered "ancient urns" at the dig site outside Uldaman. I fear that the urns he found at that site incited the troggs, just as did the idols I found here. I need you to get those urns for our studies. Go to the Uldaman site, gather the urns, then return to me.Pearl Diving^37^All^Badlands^Rigglefuzz^Rigglefuzz^^^^Bring 9 Blue Pearls to Rigglefuzz in the Badlands.^The Badlands is a harsh place, filled with vicious predators and bold scavengers. Scary, especially for a short little goblin. To survive, I have to be tricky! I know the recipe for flash bombs. I use those to scare away wildlife. But I'm running low on one of the ingredients: crushed blue pearl powder. Get me some and I'll make it worth your efforts. Heh, and I hope you have good boots on. The Blue Pearls I need are found from clams at the Vile Reef. Yep, the Vile Reef in Stranglethorn!Fiery Blaze Enchantments^45^Alliance^Badlands^Sigrun Ironhew^Sigrun Ironhew^^^^Acquire a Black Drake's Heart for Sigrun Ironhew.^As an apprentice to Feranor Steeltoe, I learned his special technique for imbuing weapons with fiery enchantments. Last I heard of him, he was working at a smithy with a hunting party up in Lordaeron. I can't tell you too many of the details about the process, but I can tell you it requires blood from a rare, still-beating black drake whelp's heart. I don't have much to do waiting for word from Ironforge. If you bring me a heart from the whelps in Lethlor Ravine, I'll show you my skill!Ironband Wants You!^37^Alliance^Ironforge^Prospector Stormpike^Prospector Ironband^Ironband Wants You!^^^Speak with Prospector Ironband at Ironband's Excavation Site in Loch Modan.^<name>. I received reports from Prospector Ironband at his excavation site in Loch Modan--he needs some legwork done concerning another of our excavations. I don't have more details than that, but if you want to stretch your legs then go speak with Ironband.The Black Box^40^Alliance^Badlands^Corroded Black Box^Pilot Longbeard^^^^Take the Corroded Black Box to the Hall of Arms in Ironforge.^The surface of this metallic black box is heavily pitted, as if it had been immersed in acid - it must have been sitting in the giant condor's stomach for a long time. Turning the box over, a symbol is found stamped on its bottom. Below the symbol are the words: "Engine #19 - Ironforge Siege Brigade"Solution to Doom^40^All^Badlands^Theldurin the Lost^Theldurin the Lost^^^To Ironforge for Yagyin's Digest, To the Undercity for Yagyin's Digest^Bring the Tablet of Ryun'eh to Theldurin the Lost.^Oh my! Oh my! There is a doom approaching. Mark me! A doom! No, I cannot speak of it...cannot utter their names or they may hear me! But if we learn, yes, if we learn more of them...then maybe we can learn how to foil them! Maybe. Go into Uldaman. No! I said it! You must find...find the tablet of...Ryun'eh. Yes, find it! And don't make me speak that name again! It is deep in that place, in an ancient chest. That's where it hides...in a chest crafted before the works of any dwarf.Study of the Elements: Rock^37^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^Study of the Elements: Rock^^^Find 10 Small Stone Shards and bring them to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands.^Here in the Badlands I've stopped to work on my latest project: my shackles of elemental binding. When complete, they will allow mages to summon even more powerful elementals for use in even greater capacities. To start things off, I need small stone shards to test some of my newest offensive spells along with a few gizmos I've pieced together. The shards are easily collected from the lesser rock elementals to the west of here. Could you bring me some?Study of the Elements: Rock^39^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^Study of the Elements: Rock^^^Bring 3 Large Stone Slabs to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands.^<name>, you've already proven more able than all my apprentices combined. The next parts I need require a little more strength. Large stone slabs can be found on rock elementals if you're careful enough. Their bodies are stronger and larger, and therefore more prone to having pieces large enough for my tests. You can find them further west of here or southeast along the mountains' edges. Take your time; I'll need a while to test these smaller pieces you brought me.Study of the Elements: Rock^42^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^Study of the Elements: Rock^^Stone Is Better than Cloth, This Is Going to Be Hard^Bring 5 Bracers of Rock Binding to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands.^<name>, there's one more part I need from the elementals here in the Badlands: the bracers of rock binding from the greater rock elementals. By my calculations, those bracers should be enough to gauge the strength of my own shackles. My attempts at scrying the greater rock elementals showed a group of them southwest of here, near some ogres if I recall. Bring me 5 of their bracers just so I have extras. Servo's notorious for misplacing my reagents and research.Coolant Heads Prevail^37^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^Coolant Heads Prevail^^^Find Frost Oil and bring it to Lotwil Veriatus in Badlands.^Let me tell you something about Frost Oil: nothing can keep an engine or gears from overheating quite like it. Its cooling properties are extraordinary, and its longevity as a lubricant without equal. That's not all: it also aids in retaining enchantments on magical items. I need a vial of it to increase the magical capacity of my shackles and make them powerful enough to stop our summoned friend from killing us all. Bro'kin, a goblin friend of mine, can teach you to make it. He's in Alterac.Gyro... What?^37^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^Coolant Heads Prevail^^Liquid Stone, This Is Going to Be Hard^Bring a Gyrochronatom to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands.^<name>, you've done your job well beyond all standards. <Lotwil's obviously distracted by his work.> If we ever meet in Kharanos, feel free to come apply for work. Whoops! Quick, grab the... yes, that. Thanks. Now I just need one more thing. It's a small part, but rather crucial, I'm afraid: a gyrochronatom. If you could just go grab one and bring it to me, I should be ready to complete this.Liquid Stone^37^All^Badlands^Lucien Tosselwrench^Lucien Tosselwrench^^Gyro... What?^^Bring a Healing Potion and a Lesser Invisibility Potion to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands.^I'm thinking those items you acquired for Lotwil are going to be the least of our worries, <name>. On the other hand, you've proven more than adept at the sciences Lotwil holds sacred, so how about helping me out? I need an invisibility potion and a healing potion; both might come in handy real soon if he pulls this off. In return, I'll give you this recipe for a potion I've been developing while learning from Lotwil. It's based on some of the research he's been doing here in the Badlands.Stone Is Better than Cloth^42^All^Badlands^Lucien Tosselwrench^Lucien Tosselwrench^^Study of the Elements: Rock^^Bring some Patterned Bronze Bracers to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands.^I know how cheap Lotwil can be, <name>, so let me make you something for all your troubles. Maybe it'll even help protect you from the coming atrocity that is Lotwil's newest invention. I've been working with all the extra stones you collected for him, and I can make some nice bracers that you might want to use. They're enchanted, of course. I'll just need patterned bronze bracers crafted by a blacksmith so I can complete the bracers I'm making for you.Tremors of the Earth^50^Alliance^Badlands^Garek^Garek^Tremors of the Earth^^^Use the Sign of the Earth to activate the Pillars of Amethyst, Opal, and Diamond and obtain the Runestones.^It has become obvious that we cannot ensure that Blacklash and Hematus will remain imprisoned in Lethlor. That black dragons have taken up residence there, and that the ogres managed to steal the Sign indicates that more drastic measures will have to be taken. The drakes' prison is maintained by three runestones that may only be retrieved using the Sign of the Earth. Those runestones can then be used to break the seal which imprisons them. <name>... assure that their dreams are eternal.Mirages^38^Alliance^Badlands^Sigrun Ironhew^Sigrun Ironhew^Mirages^^Tremors of the Earth^Retrieve the Supply Crate for Sigrun Ironhew.^In our hurry to leave the Uldaman excavation site, we were forced to abandon many wagons and crates of supplies along the way. The local ogres from Camp Kosh have been on our abandoned equipment like vultures on a rotting corpse. Don't smell much better, either. Than the corpses, I mean. Anyways, they took the cart that was carrying all our weapons and such... so--well, this is a bit embarrassing--we haven't been able to get any food. We're in a bit of a pickle here, suppose you could help us out?A Dwarf and His Tools^35^Alliance^Badlands^Prospector Ryedol^Prospector Ryedol^^^^Find Ryedol's Lucky Pick and return it to Prospector Ryedol south of Hammertoe's Dig Site.^Hey, <name>. Be careful 'round here. There be Dark Iron dwarves all around--looked like the Shadowforge clan. They just attacked the excavation site I was workin' at--killed nearly everyone there, including my boss Hammertoe. I barely escaped with me life. The site's just to the north of here, and I'm tryin' to plan a way to get some of our supplies back, especially me lucky pick. Think you'd be up to helpin' me out some? One of those damned Dark Iron must have my pick! Could be anyone of them.A Sign of Hope^35^Alliance^Badlands^Crumpled Map^Prospector Ryedol^A Sign of Hope^^^Find Prospector Ryedol and let him know Hammertoe Grez is alive.^<There is text roughly scribbled in chalk on the map.> "Ryedol,They're taking me to Uldaman. Send help.-Hammertoe"A Sign of Hope^35^Alliance^Loch Modan^Prospector Ryedol^Hammertoe Grez^A Sign of Hope^^^Find Hammertoe Grez in Uldaman.^<name>, can ye find him? Can you find Hammertoe in Uldaman? If those dirty Shadowforge are holdin' him hostage to figure out what he knows about the titan excavations, then all of Ironforge could be in huge trouble. For a long time now those Dark Irons have been lookin' for magics to make more powerful golems. Hammertoe was doin' the same, of course, but only to stop them. They're probably keepin' him alive until they learn what he knows.Ye've got to hurry if you're gonna save him!Amulet of Secrets^40^Alliance^Loch Modan^Hammertoe Grez^Hammertoe Grez^A Sign of Hope^^^Find Hammertoe's Amulet and return it to him in Uldaman.^Ye're brave... ... to come into Uldaman fer me, <class>. If ye're really here to help... ol' Hammertoe, then... ... you'll need to find... me amulet. Deepshadow's got it... Magregan Deepshadow. He's 'round here... in the ruins fer sure. That amulet'll lead 'em... ... right to the scrolls if he ain't stopped. It's up to you, <name>. Please... get that amulet. The scrolls will surely help the Dark Irons create even more powerful golems. I just know it. I can feel it in me bones.Prospect of Faith^40^Alliance^Badlands^Hammertoe Grez^Prospector Ryedol^A Sign of Hope^^^Take Hammertoe's Amulet to Prospector Ryedol in the Badlands.^<Hammertoe holds his wounds and takes a moment to regain his composure before speaking again.> Find Ryedol, <name>. Bring 'im me amulet. <cough cough> He'll... figure out what to do. He knows I was seeking the origins of our people, and he... ... knows it was also my mission to stop the Shadowforge clan. They must not be allowed to find the scrolls...Prospect of Faith^40^Alliance^Badlands^Prospector Ryedol^Historian Karnik^A Sign of Hope^^Passing Word of a Threat^Take Hammertoe's Amulet to Historian Karnik in Ironforge.^Okay, okay... who would know what to do? Historian Karnik! That's it! He's in Ironforge. He'll be able to help. He and Hammertoe were workin' together to find the lost artifacts in Uldaman. Guess the Shadowforge found out the two of them knew more than they were lettin' on. Tell Karnik what's happened to Hammertoe and give him the amulet--he'll tell you what needs to be done next.Passing Word of a Threat^40^Alliance^Badlands^Historian Karnik^Advisor Belgrum^Passing Word of a Threat^Prospect of Faith^^Find Advisor Belgrum and give him his note.^<name>, run and find Advisor Belgrum as quickly as you can. Tell him what you've witnessed and ask him how he wants us to proceed. This note will explain more to him. In the meantime, I will take the time to speak to Hammertoe's spirit. Maybe he knows something that will help us put a stop to those Shadowforge cretins' activities in the Badlands. We can only pray.Passing Word of a Threat^40^Alliance^Badlands^Advisor Belgrum^Historian Karnik^Passing Word of a Threat^^^Speak to Historian Karnik.^<Advisor Belgrum reaches the end of the note, and his eyes widen for a moment.> Och, these are evil tidings. <name>, please return to Historian Karnik and tell him on the king's authority to act on this information swiftly and decisively. He must halt the Shadowforge's activities in the Badlands.To Ironforge for Yagyin's Digest^40^Alliance^Badlands^Theldurin the Lost^Gerrig Bonegrip^To Ironforge for Yagyin's Digest^Solution to Doom^^Give the Sigil of the Hammer to Gerrig Bonegrip in the Forlorn Cavern of Ironforge.^The Tablet tells much. But not enough! Not nearly enough! There is a book, a digest that Yagyin wrote in ages past. The ... people I fled ... they keep this book in many places. And their most learned study it. It holds vast knowledge. Knowledge to protect us! Go to Gerrig Bonegrip. He is in a shop in Ironforge, in the Forlorn Cavern. Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them. Ask him for Yagyin's Digest ... and bring it to me!To the Undercity for Yagyin's Digest^40^Horde^Badlands^Theldurin the Lost^Keeper Bel'dugur^To the Undercity for Yagyin's Digest^Solution to Doom^^Bring the Sigil of the Hammer to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity.^The tablet tells much. But not enough! Not nearly enough! There is a book, a digest that Yagyin wrote in ages past. The... people I fled from... they keep this book in many places. And their most learned study it. It holds vast knowledge. Knowledge to protect us! Go to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity of Lordaeron. Show him this sigil and he'll think you one of them. Ask him for Yagin's Digest...and bring it to me!The Absent Minded Prospector^20^All^Darkshore^Archaeologist Hollee^Prospector Remtravel^Trouble In Darkshore?^^The Absent Minded Prospector^Travel south and check on Prospector Remtravel.^What an honor it was when Master Greywhisker assigned me to work under the guidance of the great Prospector Remtravel. At the academy in Ironforge everyone knew of Remtravel's great discoveries. But the prospector is rather... um... oblivious ...to his surroundings. We had uncovered evidence of a great society. Horrible golems sprang forth from the ground and overran the site. Remtravel never seemed to notice. I ran back to Auberdine for help. Please travel south and see if the prospector is okay!Trouble In Darkshore?^14^All^Darnassus^Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker^Archaeologist Hollee^Trouble In Darkshore?^^^Travel to Auberdine and look for signs of the dwarven excavation team.^How nice it is to see a <class> interested in the great archeological wonders of our world. Oftentimes our work is dismissed as mere hobby by our friends in the Alliance. But what many fail to realize is that recent discoveries in Khaz Modan have proven that a great and powerful force threatens all of Azeroth, from Lordaeron to Kalimdor. I am most worried about my crew that I sent to Darkshore. They haven't sent word in weeks. Travel to Auberdine and look for a clue as to their whereabouts.The Absent Minded Prospector^20^All^Darkshore^Prospector Remtravel^Archaeologist Hollee^The Absent Minded Prospector^The Absent Minded Prospector^^Protect Prospector Remtravel as he searches for the mysterious fossil, then return to Archaeologist Hollee in Auberdine.^So then, Hollee... oh that's right, you are not Hollee. Where's Hollee? Bah, that's beside the point. We must find that stone brush... I mean the mysterious fossil! We must find that fossil. The Explorers' League in Darnassus will want some indication as to what I've been doing. Let me know when you are ready and we will hunt down that brush.... I mean fossil! We shall find something in writing to satisfy the League. So are you ready yet?Tremors of the Earth^43^Alliance^Badlands^Garek^Garek^Tremors of the Earth^Mirages^^Retrieve the Sign of the Earth for Garek.^I heard from Sigrun that you have been a great help to him. Perhaps I might enlist your help. I was sent here by my master, Krasus of the Kirin Tor, to put an end to the trouble brewing in Lethlor Ravine. I cannot divulge the exact nature of my assignment here or the tasks that I must undertake, but be assured it is of vital importance. A band of wandering ogres, sometimes seen near Camp Boff, stole an object called the Sign of the Earth; I must have it. Bring it to me, and I will tell you more.Scrounging^40^Alliance^Badlands^Sigrun Ironhew^Sigrun Ironhew^Mirages^^^Get 7 pieces of Scrap Metal for Sigrun.^It's going to be tough going here if I can't manage to scrounge up some materials to construct some defenses and other necessities. I've noticed that the ogres in the area seem to be well equipped with scrap metal. Maybe the stories of siege engines in the Badlands weren't so far off after all... Anyways, the Prospector's been getting worried about the state of our little camp, so I'd like to get working soon if I can. The main ogre camp is at Dustbelch Grotto, a good trek to the west of here.This Is Going to Be Hard^42^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lucien Tosselwrench^This Is Going to Be Hard^Study of the Elements: Rock, Gyro... What?^^Speak to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands.^Wonderful, wonderful. <Lotwil looks up at you for a moment before going back to his shackles.> Go speak to Lucien, <name>. I need a cog #5. Bring it to me, will you?The Star, the Hand and the Heart^44^Alliance^Badlands^Gerrig Bonegrip^Gerrig Bonegrip^To Ironforge for Yagyin's Digest^^Forbidden Knowledge^Return the items on the Bonegrip's Note to Gerrig Bonegrip in Ironforge.^Yagyin's Digest, eh? Are you starting a new chapter of us, somewhere? Never mind, it is not my place to ask. I will help you, for I have an extra copy. We must aid each other, yes? That is how we flourish. I require three items of power. Bring them to me and I will give you the digest. I will not speak their names. Ears may be on us. But here, I will write them down.The Star, the Hand and the Heart^44^Horde^Undercity^Keeper Bel'dugur^Keeper Bel'dugur^To the Undercity for Yagyin's Digest^^Forbidden Knowledge^Bring the items on Bel'dugur's Note to Keeper Bel'dugur in the Undercity.^You need Yagyin's Digest? Your plan, then, is to gather another flock? Of course it is...and of course I will help you, <brother/sister>. But you must help me too. I require three items of power. Bring me these and the digest will be yours. I cannot utter the names of these items, but I will write them down. Get me the items on this list. If you can do that, then you are truly worthy of opening your own chapter of our order.Forbidden Knowledge^40^All^Badlands^Gerrig Bonegrip^Theldurin the Lost^To Ironforge for Yagyin's Digest^^^Bring Yagyin's Digest to Theldurin.^I have the digest for you, <name>. I need not tell you to take great care with it. And to keep it far from unfriendly hands. This book holds many truths... ...And the truth can burn.Find Agmond^38^Alliance^Badlands^Prospector Ironband^Battered Dwarven Skeleton^Ironband Wants You!^^^Find Agmond.^Prospector Agmond was in charge of our excavation sites in the Badlands, to the southwest. I say "was" because...well, I haven't heard from him in weeks. I need you to find Agmond so I can get his report. Last I heard Agmond was at the southernmost dig site in the Badlands--a tiny operation past the Angor Fortress. I'd start your search for him there.Murdaloc^42^Alliance^Badlands^Battered Dwarven Skeleton^Prospector Ironband^Ironband Wants You!^^^Slay Agmond's killer, Murdaloc.^Agmond's tracks lead from the west. It is easy to tell from the bloody smears across rock and sand that the dwarf crawled some distance. And here he died. Upon close inspection, the word "Murdaloc" is roughly scrawled in a patch of Badlands sandstone. Scrawled next to Agmond's dead hand.The Absent Minded Prospector^20^All^Darkshore^Archaeologist Hollee^Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker^The Absent Minded Prospector^^^Take the mysterious fossil to Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker in Darnassus.^So the prospector wants to send the mysterious fossil to the Explorers' League in Darnassus? I don't feel right leaving Darkshore without him. Here, <name>, deliver the mysterious fossil to Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker in Darnassus.The Ashenvale Hunt^20^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Bluff Runner Windstrider^Senani Thunderheart^^^^Speak with Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.^Attention, young adventurers! The wilds of Ashenvale await you! The Horde has established a strong presence in the lands north of the Barrens. Our two outposts - Splintertree Post and the Zoram Strand Outpost - strive to bring glory to the Horde! Those who would prove themselves should seek out guidance there. Of note: Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post, directly north of the Barrens, seeks adventurers willing to take part in a great hunt of Ashenvale!Dangers of the Windfury^8^All^Mulgore^Ruul Eagletalon^Ruul Eagletalon^^^^Bring 8 Windfury Talons to Ruul Eagletalon in Bloodhoof Village.^Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, <name>. I am Ruul, warrior and teacher. You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of Mulgore. If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury harpies to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road. They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill.Preparation for Ceremony^11^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Eyahn Eagletalon^Eyahn Eagletalon^^^^Collect 6 Azure Feathers and 6 Bronze Feathers, and bring them to Eyahn Eagletalon in Thunder Bluff.^<name>, my brother soon stands before Chief Bloodhoof, and it is my honor to make his headdress for him. I want to ask a favor of you while I finish tanning these leather straps. There is not time for me to find enough feathers, and I was wondering, would you gather more for me? You can find feathers of the correct size from the harpies residing far to the north and northwest of Thunder Bluff. I need only 6 azure and 6 bronze feathers to complete the design.Sharing the Land^6^All^Mulgore^Baine Bloodhoof^Baine Bloodhoof^^^^Kill 10 Palemane Tanners, 8 Palemane Skinners, and 5 Palemane Poachers, then return to Baine Bloodhoof in Bloodhoof Village.^<name>, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as I have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek out. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land. Palemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled. Words are no longer the answer.Dwarven Digging^8^All^Mulgore^Baine Bloodhoof^Baine Bloodhoof^^^^Collect 5 Prospector's Picks.^There are dwarves preparing a dig site to the northwest. They think secrets lie in the earth, and that is true, but hollowing and defiling the land is no way to earn its teachings. Collect the dwarven tools of digging, smash them, and return to me with the dwarves' broken tools. You can smash the tools at a forge. You will find one in Thunder Bluff, but any forge -- even a forge at the dwarven camp -- will suffice.The Hunt Begins^2^Horde^Mulgore^Grull Hawkwind^Grull Hawkwind^^^The Hunt Continues, Simple Note, Etched Note, Rune-Inscribed Note, Verdant Note^Grull Hawkwind in Camp Narache wants you to bring him 7 Plainstrider Feathers and 7 pieces of Plainstrider Meat.^You have a promising air about you, and will prove yourself to the tribe. Perhaps someday soon you will be welcomed into the great city of Thunder Bluff. But before that can happen you must prove yourself to my father, Chief Hawkwind. Up here on Red Cloud Mesa we pride ourselves on keen hunting skills. Tauren hunt out of necessity and for sport. Our supply of meats has run low and we require feathers for clothing. Hunt the nearby plainstriders and prove yourself by resupplying the village.Poison Water^5^Tauren^Mulgore^Mull Thunderhorn^Mull Thunderhorn^^^Winterhoof Cleansing^Bring 6 Prairie Wolf Paws and 4 Plainstrider Talons to Mull Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof.^Goblins and their servants have tainted our sacred water wells! We cannot allow this. To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual. First we will create a cleansing totem for the Winterhoof Water Well. To do this, the land must offer its aid. Hunt prairie wolves for their paws and adult plainstriders for their talons. They are to the southwest. Return to me with the paws and talons, <name>.The Ravaged Caravan^8^All^Mulgore^Morin Cloudstalker^Sealed Supply Crate^The Ravaged Caravan^^^Morin Cloudstalker wants you to examine the contents of a supply crate at the Ravaged Caravan.^A few days ago, we found a Venture Co. caravan traveling under guard on the northern shore of Stonebull Lake. We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan. We left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong. Perhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates.The Hunt Continues^3^All^Mulgore^Grull Hawkwind^Grull Hawkwind^The Hunt Continues^The Hunt Begins^^Grull Hawkwind in Camp Narache wants you to bring him 10 Mountain Cougar Pelts.^A tauren skilled in the ways of the hunt knows that his prey is not for mere trophy. The beasts of the plains provide us with a means of survival. You will make quite an impression on the elders if you can bring back some highly valued Mountain Cougar Pelts. You can find the beasts lurking in the hills to the south. Our children need clothing and our tents need mending.The Ravaged Caravan^8^All^Mulgore^Sealed Supply Crate^Morin Cloudstalker^The Ravaged Caravan^^The Venture Co., Supervisor Fizsprocket^Return the Venture Co. Documents to Morin Cloudstalker near Bloodhoof Village.^Prying open the lid reveals a tightly packed assortment of ore and minerals, more evidence of the Venture Co.'s mining operation in Mulgore. On the top of the ore and minerals you remove a tightly bound sheaf of papers. Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire.A Humble Task^2^All^Mulgore^Chief Hawkwind^Greatmother Hawkwind^A Humble Task^^^Chief Hawkwind wants you to search for his mother near the water well to the southeast of Camp Narache.^All members of the tribe share in the harmony of life. We live together and work together. Our commitment to one another carries with it a high degree of responsibility. I ask of you now a humble task. My mother set out this morning to fetch water from the well to the southeast of Narache. It has been quite some time now. Perhaps you could check on her for me while I attend to tribal matters here?A Humble Task^3^All^Mulgore^Greatmother Hawkwind^Chief Hawkwind^A Humble Task^^^Take a Water Pitcher from the water well.^I have traveled many paths through life and these old legs lack the vigor they once had. I can still perform my duties to the tribe. Sometimes it just takes an old woman a little longer to do the task. But you look like an eager <class>. Let's put some of that youthful vitality to the test. Take a water pitcher from the well and bring it to my son, the Chief, in Camp Narache. Remember that even the most humble task can gain the recognition of elders.Winterhoof Cleansing^6^Tauren^Mulgore^Mull Thunderhorn^Mull Thunderhorn^^Poison Water^Thunderhorn Totem^Use the Winterhoof Cleansing Totem at the Winterhoof Water Well, then return to Mull Thunderhorn.^I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well. Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual. You will find it to the southeast, guarded by foul goblins! This will not be an easy task, but you must do it if we are ever to use its waters again. Fortune to you, <name>.Rites of the Earthmother^3^All^Mulgore^Chief Hawkwind^Seer Graytongue^A Humble Task^^^Travel to Seer Graytongue who lives in the hills directly south of Camp Narache.^Your willingness to perform a humble task for the tauren of Narache and your eagerness to learn are noble traits, <name>. I believe one day you will be heralded in Thunder Bluff as a <class> of greatness. Before that you must embark on the Rites of the Earthmother, of which there are three. The first test is the Rite of Strength. Travel to Seer Graytongue and tell him Chief Hawkwind has sent you. You will find the seer's abode directly to the south of Camp Narache, tucked away in the hills.Thunderhorn Totem^7^All^Mulgore^Mull Thunderhorn^Mull Thunderhorn^^Winterhoof Cleansing^Thunderhorn Cleansing^Bring 6 Stalker Claws and 6 Cougar Claws to Mull Thunderhorn.^To create the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem, you must gather the claws of the predators of the Mulgore plains. Hunt prairie stalkers for their stalker claws and flatland cougars for their cougar claws, then return to me. You will find the prairie stalkers and flatland cougars to the east and west.Rite of Strength^4^All^Mulgore^Seer Graytongue^Chief Hawkwind^A Humble Task^^Rites of the Earthmother^Kill Bristlebacks in Brambleblade Ravine and bring 8 Bristleback Belts to Chief Hawkwind in Camp Narache.^The Rites of the Earthmother are the steps a young tauren needs to take to gain respect in Thunder Bluff. First you must pass the Rite of Strength. In this test you must prove your bravery by slaying enemies of the tribe. Bristlebacks of Brambleblade Ravine to the east are encroaching on our tribal lands. They ambush our hunting parties and steal from the village by dark. Show your valor by slaying these villains and return to the Chief in Camp Narache with their belts as proof of your deeds.Thunderhorn Cleansing^8^Tauren^Mulgore^Mull Thunderhorn^Mull Thunderhorn^^Thunderhorn Totem^Wildmane Totem^Use the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem at the Thunderhorn Water Well, then return to Mull.^The totem is ready, <name>. And again, it is your task to perform the ritual of cleansing. Go to the Thunderhorn Water Well, north of the village, and use the Thunderhorn Cleansing Totem in your ritual. After you do this, return to me. May the spirits guide you.Wildmane Totem^10^All^Mulgore^Mull Thunderhorn^Mull Thunderhorn^^Thunderhorn Cleansing^Wildmane Cleansing^Bring 8 Prairie Alpha Teeth to Mull Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof Village.^There is but one water well left to cleanse, named after the Wildmane clan. For this well to be pure, the land must offer the teeth of a fierce predator, the prairie wolf alpha. Find the alphas to the north, then return to me when your hunt is finished. Alphas often wander around the base of our mighty city, Thunder Bluff.Wildmane Cleansing^10^Tauren^Mulgore^Mull Thunderhorn^Mull Thunderhorn^^Wildmane Totem^^Use the Wildmane Cleansing Totem at the Wildmane Water Well, then return to Mull Thunderhorn.^Your cleansing of the Winterhoof and Thunderhorn wells is spoken among the spirits, young <name>. The Wildmane Totem is made, and your last task lies ahead. The Wildmane Water Well lies north of Thunder Bluff. Perform the ritual! Heal the land of the goblins' poisons! Let clean water flow once again!Swoop Hunting^6^All^Mulgore^Harken Windtotem^Harken Windtotem^^^^Bring 8 Trophy Swoop Quills to Harken Windtotem in Bloodhoof Village.^The swoop is a cunning bird, and difficult to find and hunt. A collection of Swoop Quills is a badge of cleverness and determination for a hunter. If you are willing to take up this task, then enter the plains and hunt the swoop. Bring me their quills, and bring honor to your clan. The swoops may be found anywhere in Mulgore, but your eyes must be sharp to spot them, and your hooves must be quick to catch them.An Ambassador of Evil^44^Alliance^Badlands^Historian Karnik^Advisor Belgrum^Passing Word of a Threat^^The Lost Tablets of Will^Kill Ambassador Infernus in Angor Fortress and bring proof of his death to Advisor Belgrum in Ironforge.^Ambassador Infernus was sent to Angor Fortress by Ragnaros himself to mind the Shadowforge seeking lost artifacts in Uldaman. It has already meant tremendous casualties for our people, but it has obviously grown worse. I hesitate to guess how many artifacts they would be able to find and use against Ironforge. Our goal is simple, <class>. Return to the Badlands and destroy Ambassador Infernus. Once the threat is eliminated, return to Advisor Belgrum with proof of your victory. It is in your hands now.Rites of the Earthmother^5^All^Mulgore^Chief Hawkwind^Baine Bloodhoof^^Rite of Strength^Rite of Vision^Take the Totem of Hawkwind to Baine Bloodhoof in Bloodhoof Village. Follow the road out of Camp Narache.^For you to continue with the Rites of the Earthmother you must pass two more tests. It is time for you to broaden your experience, <name>. Travel to Bloodhoof Village and seek out the Chief, Baine Bloodhoof, son of Cairne. There you may continue your journey and earn the acceptance of the elders of Thunder Bluff. Take this totem to Baine. He will recognize my carvings and help you on your path. Follow the road out of Camp Narache and travel with haste. Do not stray or you will lose your way.The Venture Co.^10^All^Mulgore^Morin Cloudstalker^Morin Cloudstalker^^The Ravaged Caravan^^Kill 14 Venture Co. Workers and 6 Venture Co. Supervisors for Morin Cloudstalker at Bloodhoof Village.^This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background. Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message.Supervisor Fizsprocket^12^All^Mulgore^Morin Cloudstalker^Morin Cloudstalker^^The Ravaged Caravan^^Kill Supervisor Fizsprocket and return his clipboard to Morin Cloudstalker at Bloodhoof Village.^According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands. The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me. I want the mastermind behind their plans killed. His name is Supervisor Fizsprocket, you will find him at the Venture Co. mine east of the ravaged caravan. Bring me his clipboard, we shall see if we find out anything useful.Mazzranache^8^All^Mulgore^Maur Raincaller^Maur Raincaller^^^^Bring a Prairie Wolf Heart, Flatland Cougar Femur, Plainstrider Scale and Swoop Gizzard to Maur Raincaller at Bloodhoof Village.^My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite. As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I will need some hard-to-find animal parts to clean the infection from his bite: a wolf heart, cougar femur, plainstrider scale and swoop gizzard. Hurry, time is of the essence.Rite of Vision^6^All^Mulgore^Baine Bloodhoof^Zarlman Two-Moons^Rite of Vision^Rites of the Earthmother^^Speak with Zarlman Two-Moons in Bloodhoof Village.^The Rite of Vision, one of the Rites of the Earthmother, will help guide you toward earning the respect of the elders of Thunder Bluff. Our people have learned that the land is our most holy provider. In order to take part in the ritualistic vision, you must speak with the spiritual leader of the village, Zarlman Two-Moons.Gathering Leather^8^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Veren Tallstrider^Veren Tallstrider^^^Kodo Hide Bag^Bring 12 pieces of Light Leather to Veren Tallstrider in Thunder Bluff.^Greetings, young one. You have a gleam in your eye; I can tell you are eager to venture back to the plains for the hunt. May you bring honor to your clan! I work with the skins of beasts, fashioning them into clothes and armor for the people of Thunder Bluff. If you hunt beasts and bring me their skins, then I will fashion something for you.Kodo Hide Bag^10^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Veren Tallstrider^Veren Tallstrider^^Gathering Leather^^Bring 4 Light Leather and 4 Coarse Thread to Veren Tallstrider in Thunder Bluff.^The kodo beasts of Mulgore are strong and sturdy -- traits much respected among us. If you are skilled in leatherworking and wish the knowledge to make a Kodo Hide Bag, then bring me supplies for my trade. Do this, and I will share my knowledge with you.The Demon Scarred Cloak^12^All^Mulgore^Demon Scarred Cloak^Skorn Whitecloud^^^^Find someone who knows of Ghost Howl.^The ragged hide of Ghost Howl still bears a terrible wound, gained from the wolf's battles against the Burning Legion. Perhaps someone in Bloodhoof Village should know of Ghost Howl's demise....Rite of Vision^7^All^Mulgore^Zarlman Two-Moons^Zarlman Two-Moons^Rite of Vision^^Rite of Vision^Collect 2 Well Stones and 2 Ambercorn and bring them back to Zarlman Two-Moons in Bloodhoof Village.^In order to pass through the Rite of Vision, you must gather the reagents needed to make the Water of the Seers. I will need well stones, which can be found around the water wells in Mulgore. With those I will combine Ambercorn, which fall beneath the mighty trees in our land. These reagents contain magical elements, and when brewed and consumed before the tribal fire, will cause you to encounter a vision. Follow it, and it will lead you to the next step of this holy quest.Rite of Vision^7^All^Mulgore^Zarlman Two-Moons^Seer Wiserunner^Rite of Vision^Rite of Vision^^Consume the Water of the Seers in front of the tribal fire in Bloodhoof Village and follow the vision once it appears.^I now present you with the Water of the Seers. When you are ready, consume the waters near the tribal fire. Once you have ingested the holy waters, it will take a few moments before the vision materializes before the fire. At that point, it is up to you to follow it to your destiny....Rite of Wisdom^10^All^Mulgore^Seer Wiserunner^Ancestral Spirit^Rite of Vision^^^Travel to Red Rocks east of Thunder Bluff and speak with the Ancestral Spirit.^To gain acceptance amongst the elders of Thunder Bluff you must next complete the Rite of Wisdom. Now that you have passed the Rite of Vision, the ancestral spirits of Red Rocks will give you the blessing of our ancestors. Only those who have drunk from the Water of Seers can gain the blessing. Travel east of Thunder Bluff, to Red Rocks and seek out the Ancestral Spirit, <name>.Journey into Thunder Bluff^10^All^Mulgore^Ancestral Spirit^Cairne Bloodhoof^Rite of Vision^^^Speak with Cairne Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff.^You will now be revered within our great city. Any <race> worthy of completing the Rites of the Earthmother earns that honor. For your final quest, seek out our noble leader, Cairne Bloodhoof, who dwells atop the highest mesa in Thunder Bluff.Rites of the Earthmother^14^Horde^Mulgore^Cairne Bloodhoof^Cairne Bloodhoof^Rite of Vision^^^Cairne Bloodhoof in Thunder Bluff wants you to bring him the Horn of Arra'chea.^You have passed the Rites of the Earthmother and earned your place in Thunder Bluff. But in order to maintain the spot that you strived so hard to achieve, you must continue to prove your worth to your people. We are hunters, <name>. Down below in Mulgore there is a mighty kodo named Arra'chea. Show me your skills in the ways of tracking and hunting by bringing me the Horn of Arra'chea.This Is Going to Be Hard^42^All^Badlands^Lucien Tosselwrench^Lotwil Veriatus^This Is Going to Be Hard^^^Bring Cog #5 to Lotwil Veriatus.^Okay, here you go. I'm going to be over here... behind cover. Feel free to join me.This Is Going to Be Hard^45^All^Badlands^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^This Is Going to Be Hard^^^Defeat the Fam'retor Guardian and bring Lotwil's Shackles of Elemental Binding back to Lotwil Veriatus.^Haha! Done! The shackles are done! It's time, Lucien. It's time, Servo! Are you ready to bear witness to the perfect blend of alchemy, engineering, and the arcane, <name>? I shall summon forth a powerful elemental now. This is a groundbreaking day for all of us.The Battleboars^4^All^Mulgore^Grull Hawkwind^Grull Hawkwind^The Hunt Continues^^^Grull Hawkwind in Camp Narache wants you to kill Battleboars and bring back 8 Battleboar Snouts and 8 Battleboar Flanks.^The Battleboars of Brambleblade Ravine to the east are encroaching on our tribal hunting grounds. They are trained to be malicious by the Bristleback Quilboars with whom we are at war. Go and slay the vile creatures and bring back some snouts and flanks so that we can make stew for our young.Broken Alliances^43^Horde^Badlands^Gorn^Gorn^Broken Alliances^^^Kill Boss Tho'grun and bring the Sign of the Earth to Gorn in Kargath.^From the Horde's alliance with the dragon Deathwing during the Second War, we know that two of his lieutenants, Blacklash and Hematus, were imprisoned within Lethlor Ravine far to the east. We must silence our depraved allies of old to restore honor to the Horde! We hired Tho'grun and his band of ogre mercenaries to help us obtain the Sign of the Earth, a key needed to unlock the drakes' prison. Tho'grun betrayed us though, overwhelming us and taking it for himself. Go to Camp Boff and take it back!A Threat Within^1^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Deputy Willem^Marshal McBride^A Threat Within^^Brotherhood of Thieves, Eagan Peltskinner^Speak with Marshal McBride.^I hope you strapped your belt on tight, young <class>, because there is work to do here in Northshire. And I don't mean farming. The Stormwind guards are hard pressed to keep the peace here, with so many of us in distant lands and so many threats pressing close. And so we're enlisting the aid of anyone willing to defend their home. And their alliance. If you're here to answer the call, then speak with my superior, Marshal McBride. He's inside the abbey behind me.Vanquish the Betrayers^7^Horde^Durotar^Gar'Thok^Gar'Thok^Vanquish the Betrayers^^^Kill 10 Kul Tiras Sailors, 8 Kul Tiras Marines and Lieutenant Benedict and return to Gar'Thok in Razor Hill.^Led by Admiral Proudmoore, the humans of Kul Tiras encroached on Durotar, violating the Warchief's pact made with Jaina Proudmoore in order to defeat Archimonde years ago. The human aggression was repelled and Tiragarde Keep fell. But recently, the Admiral's reserves, led by Lieutenant Benedict, have retaken the keep and once again pose a threat to our homeland. These humans show no respect for diplomacy. Prove your honor and travel south to Tiragarde Keep to eliminate the human invaders.Thwarting Kolkar Aggression^8^Horde^Durotar^Lar Prowltusk^Lar Prowltusk^A Strategic Alliance^^^Lar Prowltusk outside of Sen'jin Village wants you to destroy the 3 sets of Attack Plans held within Kolkar Crag.^Lower your voice, <class>. The Kolkar centaurs lie just over the ridge to the west in Kolkar Crag. Last night while they were raiding, I snuck into their village and discovered that the dirty beasts have a three-tiered attack planned on the trolls and orcs of Durotar. We mustn't let their invasion come to fruition. Perhaps you can muster the might needed to infiltrate Kolkar Crag and destroy their attack plans. Last I saw, they had divided them up amongst three of their leaders.The New Horde^1^All^Durotar^Eitrigg^Gornek^The New Horde^^^Report to Gornek in the Den.^Throm'ka, <class>. I am Eitrigg, charged by Thrall to oversee the training of recruits. The Horde has changed from what it once was. There was a time where I left the Horde, disillusioned by the growing influence of the power-hungry pawns of the Burning Legion. During my exile, I was taken prisoner by a group of humans, but was rescued by the Warchief. Hearing his vision of the Horde free of demonic influence, guided by the shamans, I returned. Gornek will have further instructions for you.Cutting Teeth^2^Horde^Durotar^Gornek^Gornek^The New Horde^^Sting of the Scorpid, Simple Parchment, Simple Tablet, Etched Tablet, Encrypted Tablet, Rune-Inscribed Tablet, Hallowed Tablet, Glyphic Tablet, Etched Parchment, Encrypted Parchment, Rune-Inscribed Parchment, Tainted Parchment, Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise^Kill 8 Mottled Boars then return to Gornek at the Den.^The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead. I believe you would find a good match with the mottled boars you'll find to the north of here.Sting of the Scorpid^3^Horde^Durotar^Gornek^Gornek^^Cutting Teeth^^Get 8 Scorpid Worker Tails for Gornek in the Den.^Powerful warrior and awkward novice alike have fallen to the venomous sting of the scorpid. You will find large numbers of scorpids northwest of here. Bring me eight of their tails as proof of your prowess in battle. The antidote for their sting is actually made from venom extracted from their stingers. We keep large quantities of antidote for scorpid venom on hand to heal young bloods just like you... But I'm sure you won't be needing any of that, will you?Sarkoth^5^All^Durotar^Hana'zua^Hana'zua^Sarkoth^^^Kill Sarkoth and bring his claw back to Hana'zua.^<class>! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg. I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south.Carry Your Weight^7^Horde^Durotar^Furl Scornbrow^Furl Scornbrow^^^^Furl Scornbrow in the Razor Hill watchtower wants 8 Canvas Scraps.^Age has rendered me useless in battle. Now I make myself useful in other ways. From this vantage point I watch for invaders. As our strength here grows, I find myself blowing the signal horn less and less. To pass the time I fashion goods to help younger, more able warriors defend our homeland. For you, I can fashion you a bag for your belongings. If such an item would be of use to you, bring me some canvas, a material common to the humans and centaurs.Vile Familiars^4^Horde^Durotar^Zureetha Fargaze^Zureetha Fargaze^Vile Familiars^^Burning Blade Medallion^Kill 8 Vile Familiars.^I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young <class>. I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here... A group that calls itself the Burning Blade has a coven here in the Valley of Trials. They are skulking in a cave to the northeast, and their Vile Familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc. As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me.Broken Alliances^50^Horde^Badlands^Gorn^Gorn^Broken Alliances^^^Use the Sign of the Earth to activate the Pillars of Diamond, Opal, and Amethyst and obtain the Runestones.^The Seal of the Earth is held by three runestones, held in the Pillars of Diamond, Opal, and Amethyst in Lethlor Ravine. Using the Sign of the Earth, you will be able to remove the runestones and unlock the Seal of the Earth. Be wary though, <name>, the black drakes Blacklash and Hematus are not to be trifled with. See them dead and return their bindings to me. To reach the ravine, travel to the far eastern part of the Badlands. Be careful though, for the ravine is home to countless drakes.Burning Blade Medallion^5^Horde^Durotar^Zureetha Fargaze^Zureetha Fargaze^Vile Familiars^^^Bring the Burning Blade Medallion to Zureetha Fargaze, outside The Den.^Through my divinations, I see that an item of power hides deep within the Burning Blade Coven, guarded by beasts and black magic. It is called the Burning Blade Medallion, and your next task is to find it and remove it from the coven. But be wary, for the medallion may be possessed by an agent of the Burning Blade, and if so then the agent's power would be greater than the familiars you have already encountered. Go, <name>. You will find the coven in a cave, to the north and west.Sarkoth^5^All^Durotar^Hana'zua^Gornek^Sarkoth^^^Bring the news of Hana'zua's plight to Gornek at the Den.^Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily! I must endure! But it remains that I cannot make the trek back to the Den unassisted. Please, <name>, return to the Den and tell Gornek of my situation. Perhaps he can help me.Report to Sen'jin Village^5^Horde^Durotar^Zureetha Fargaze^Master Gadrin^Vile Familiars^^Report to Orgnil^Speak with Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village.^Your trials against the Burning Blade are finished... here in the Valley. But I want you to report your findings. Go to the troll village of Sen'jin and seek out Master Gadrin. Sen'jin Village is east out of the valley, then right at the fork. Tell Gadrin of the Burning Blade, and that they have reached the Valley of Trials. Discover from him if they have yet reached Sen'jin. Go, <name>, and be swift. I fear the evil found in the Burning Blade Coven is but the herald of a larger threat...Dark Storms^12^Horde^Durotar^Orgnil Soulscar^Orgnil Soulscar^^Report to Orgnil^Margoz^Bring Fizzle's Claw to Orgnil Soulscar in Razor Hill.^We cannot allow the Burning Blade a foothold in Durotar! We must destroy them before their evil festers! I have undergone my own investigations and found that a Burning Blade warlock, the goblin Fizzle Darkstorm, has camped within Thunder Ridge to the northwest. There he and his cultist minions spread chaos. Find and defeat Fizzle, and bring me his dead claw!Minshina's Skull^9^Horde^Durotar^Master Gadrin^Master Gadrin^^^^Retrieve Minshina's skull from the circle of power on the Echo Isles.^I hear the voice of my brother, Minshina, calling to me in my dreams. He was taken by Zalazane, the warlock on the Echo Isles to the east. And he is dead. But death is not freedom for my brother. Minshina's spirit was trapped within his own skull by Zalazane's magics. In my dreams I see it with other skulls, in a circle of power on the largest Echo Isle. As long as it remains there my brother's soul is doomed. Please, <name>. Find the circle and retrieve Minshina's skull. Bring it to me. Free him!Ak'Zeloth^13^Horde^Durotar^Neeru Fireblade^Ak'Zeloth^Neeru Fireblade^^^Speak with Ak'Zeloth in the Barrens.^Since the last great war when the Burning Legion was defeated, I have searched for sources of demonic corruption in orc society. The collar you brought me confirms my fears. It belongs to the Burning Blade, a cult that rallies around an item of demonic power. It is called the Demon Seed, and it resides in the Barrens atop Dreadmist Peak. It must be destroyed! Go to Far Watch Post, on the border of the Barrens to the west, and speak with my assistant, Ak'Zeloth. He will direct you further.Need for a Cure^9^Horde^Durotar^Rhinag^Rhinag^^^^Find Kor'ghan in Orgrimmar and get the Venomtail Antidote. Then bring the antidote to Rhinag near the northwestern border of Durotar.^<name>... your timing is perfect. I just hope I can compliment your haste as well. I was careless while fighting a few of the venomtails nearby, and one of them stung me deeply. I can feel its poison weakening me even as we speak. At this rate, I got maybe an hour left to live. But I'll need your help if I'm to do so... Kor'ghan in Orgrimmar knows how to make the antidote. Find him... and hurry, <name>. I won't be able to last much longer. He should be in the Cleft of Shadow.Finding the Antidote^9^Horde^Durotar^Kor'ghan^Kor'ghan^^^^Bring 4 Venomtail Poison Sacs to Kor'ghan in Orgrimmar.^Venomtails are some of the deadliest scorpids in Durotar. It was unwise for Rhinag to hunt them without having some of the antidote with him, but right now, chastising is the last thing he needs. Bring me a few venomtail poison sacs from any of the venomtails near the entrance of Orgrimmar and I'll make an antidote for him. Make haste, <name>. One of our own needs your help.Break a Few Eggs^8^Horde^Durotar^Cook Torka^Cook Torka^^^^Bring 3 Taillasher Eggs to Cook Torka in Razor Hill.^Bah! I almost forgot I need to get breakfast ready. <name>, get yourself movin' and get me some taillasher eggs. I'll need at least three of them if I'm going to have enough for tomorrow's meal. The Bloodtalon taillashers can be fierce, and protect their eggs to the death more often than not. They sometimes bury their eggs too deep in the earth to uncover safely, but if you head to the Echo Isles to the southeast of Sen'jin Village, you can usually find them all over those islands.Lost But Not Forgotten^11^Horde^Durotar^Misha Tor'kren^Misha Tor'kren^^^^Bring a sign of Kron's fate to Misha Tor'kren at the farmstead northwest of Razor Hill.^<name>, please, can you help me? My son Kron went hunting days ago, and he still hasn't returned. He went west towards the Barrens to hunt crocolisks along Southfury River. I fear the worst. As strong as he was, his stubborn pride has always drawn him into trouble. I warned him that the crocolisks were powerful and vicious. He grew angry and stormed off. If you can't find him, at least bring me a sign of his fate... even if you have to open up the stomach of every crocolisk along the Southfury's banks.Practical Prey^8^Horde^Durotar^Vel'rin Fang^Vel'rin Fang^^^^Bring 4 Durotar Tiger Furs to Vel'rin Fang in Sen'jin Village.^Many of the hides we use come from Durotar tigers, <name>. Blankets, armor, tents: there are a great many reasons we hunt the beasts, and many reasons we let them thrive at the same time. The time has come for us to cull the flock, so to speak. Our numbers grow, and our needs are beginning to overwhelm our stocks. I need more hides if I'm to prepare suitable goods for our people. Bring me 4 Durotar tiger furs, and I shall reward you. You can find them on the islands south of here.A Solvent Spirit^7^Horde^Durotar^Master Vornal^Master Vornal^^^^Bring 4 Intact Makrura Eyes and 8 vials of Crawler Mucus to Master Vornal in Sen'jin Village.^Although my eyes fail me, I still can see clearly enough. More often I must rely on my alchemical skills to aid me in magics that once came easily. But I refuse to take on an apprentice--no troll or orc worthy enough has ever come forward. Are you worthy? Yes, of course you are... of course you think you are. I need a few things. Will you get them for me? I need intact makrura eyes, and vials of crawler mucus. You can find them on any makrura or crawler in Durotar. We shall speak again soon.Chen's Empty Keg^15^Horde^The Barrens^Chen's Empty Keg^Brewmaster Drohn^Chen's Empty Keg^^^Find someone who knows about Chen's Empty Keg.^A small placard on one of the ends of the keg says, "Chen Stormstout- May your spirit be raised and always raise your spirits."Chen's Empty Keg^15^Horde^The Barrens^Brewmaster Drohn^Brewmaster Drohn^Chen's Empty Keg^^^Bring 5 Savannah Lion Tusks, 5 Plainstrider Kidneys, and 1 Thunder Lizard Horn to Brewmaster Drohn in Ratchet.^Would you like a taste of Chen's namesake? Ahh, the stormstout is a mighty brew. Chen taught the recipe to my mentor, and my mentor passed it on to me. I'll need you to get me a few things, but I can tell you this: the kick is worth it. Bring me 5 savannah lion tusks from any savannah lion, 5 plainstrider kidneys from any plainstrider, and 1 thunder lizard horn from any species of thunder lizard. That should do the trick nicely. You can find these ingredients throughout the Barrens.Chen's Empty Keg^24^Horde^The Barrens^Brewmaster Drohn^Brewmaster Drohn^Chen's Empty Keg^^^Bring 5 Lightning Glands, 1 Thunderhawk Saliva Gland and 1 Kodo Liver to Brewmaster Drohn in Ratchet.^Good stuff, that stormstout, huh? I have another recipe that I learned from Chen. Would you be interested? It won't take long to make, and it might be useful if you plan on adventuring some more. Bring me 5 lightning glands from any stormhide, 1 thunderhawk saliva gland from greater thunderhawks, and a kodo liver from any of the Barrens' kodos. Like I said, this stuff has kick; it's the trogg ale that I mentioned to you before.Report to Orgnil^7^Horde^Durotar^Master Gadrin^Orgnil Soulscar^^Report to Sen'jin Village^Dark Storms^Speak with Orgnil Soulscar in Razor Hill.^We at Sen'jin Village are not without our own troubles, and we thank you for your aid. But the news you bring regarding the Burning Blade could be trouble for everyone. There is an orc stationed at Razor Hill, Orgnil Soulscar, who polices Durotar from evils such as the Burning Blade! Go to Orgnil and tell him of our plight, as well as your news from the Valley of Trials. He will want to know these things. Razor Hill lies to the north.Je'neu of the Earthen Ring^27^Horde^Ashenvale^Mastok Wrilehiss^Je'neu Sancrea^The Befouled Element^^^Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale.^The Earthen Ring is a shamanistic group dedicated to studying and preserving the elements. They have forgotten more about crazy old gods, ancient legends and lore than most scholars will ever know. Lucky for you, I know someone in the Earthen Ring here in Ashenvale. Head over to Zoram'gar Outpost on the coast of the Zoram Strand; show Je'neu Sancrea what you found. If anyone can figure out that globe's significance, it'd be him.From The Wreckage....^8^Horde^Durotar^Gar'Thok^Gar'Thok^Vanquish the Betrayers^^^Gar'Thok of Razor Hill wants you to retrieve 3 Gnomish Tools from the wreckage off the coast.^One of my most observant scouts brings back word that the wreckage of Proudmoore's fleet still remains off the coast of Durotar, just east of Tiragarde Keep. It is no secret that the humans, in alliance with those foul little creatures known as gnomes, have an advanced knowledge of mechanics. We must have a complete understanding of all our potential enemies. And our people will benefit from this new knowledge as well. Swim through the wreckage, <name>, and retrieve for me the tools of the Alliance.Zalazane^10^Horde^Durotar^Master Gadrin^Master Gadrin^^^^Defeat Zalazane.^The witchdoctor Zalazane dwells on the Echo Isles to the east. They are the isles we once called home. From there he sends his trolls to the mainland, to hex our people and drag more of them under his sway. He must be stopped. Defeat Zalazane and his minions -- former Darkspear trolls, now lost to us. Bring me his head and I will know his reign of evil is over.Skull Rock^12^Horde^Durotar^Margoz^Margoz^Margoz^^Neeru Fireblade^Gather Searing Collars from the cultists in Skull Rock.^<name>. The Burning Blade has infested the cave east of Orgrimmar known as Skull Rock. Inside that cave they perform vile rituals, and burn their own flesh with Searing Collars. By wearing these collars, I believe the cultists attune themselves to demonic power. But to confirm this, I must have a collection of the collars to study. Go to Skull Rock and gather Searing Collars from the cultists you find there. Bring them to me, and I will uncover their secrets.Margoz^12^Horde^Durotar^Orgnil Soulscar^Margoz^Margoz^Dark Storms^^Speak with Margoz.^One of our Shamans, Margoz, knows more of the Burning Blade's corruption. He speaks of a cave called Skull Rock in the mountains - just outside Orgrimmar! - that shelters a large band of Burning Blade cultists. Before you go to Skull Rock speak with Margoz. He is wise and his council is valued. He is camped to the northeast, between the coast and Drygulch Ravine. Follow his advice, but whatever Margoz says, <name>, I still want you to crush those cultists!Neeru Fireblade^12^Horde^Durotar^Margoz^Neeru Fireblade^Neeru Fireblade^Skull Rock^^Bring an Example Collar to Neeru Fireblade in Orgrimmar.^The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful, demonic implements. Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman. We will need a warlock to study them. Take a searing collar to Neeru Fireblade. Although he is a skilled warlock, he professes to use his powers to thwart demons, and claims his research in the occult is benign. Be that true or false, we may need his aid against the demonic cult in Durotar. You may find Neeru in Orgrimmar in the Cleft of Shadow.The Admiral's Orders^7^Horde^Durotar^Aged Envelope^Gar'Thok^The Admiral's Orders^^^Take Admiral Proudmoore's Orders to Gar'Thok in Razor Hill.^You open the aged and weathered envelope and discover an official looking document. You recognize the seal of Admiral Proudmoore. This looks important. Perhaps Gar'Thok, the commander of Razor Hill, would be interested in having this information.The Admiral's Orders^7^Horde^Durotar^Gar'Thok^Vol'jin^The Admiral's Orders^^^Deliver Admiral Proudmoore's Orders to Vol'jin in Thrall's chamber in Orgrimmar.^Humans cannot be trusted. We fought alongside them with a weary heart, knowing they would betray us one day. Admiral Proudmoore's death was not enough to stop his legacy of deceit. The human scum had his plans well laid out before he ever met his demise. His reign won't even die with Benedict it seems. Who knows how long it will be before the next waves of Proudmoore's men land upon our shores. We need to get these orders to Vol'jin in Orgrimmar immediately! He can be found in Thrall's chamber.Burning Shadows^12^Horde^Durotar^Eye of Burning Shadow^Neeru Fireblade^^^^Take this eye to Neeru Fireblade in Orgrimmar.^<Words emanate from the pendant and into your mind.> Gazz'uz? Gazz'uz...report! There is word of your discovery in Skull Rock. You must prepare for an attack! Gazz'uz, I order you to speak! Speak or I will make sure Neeru Fireblade knows of your presence, and he will descend on you with swift brutality. Do not test your skills against Neeru... ...Gazz'uz, are you there...?A Sacred Burial^10^All^Mulgore^Lorekeeper Raintotem^Lorekeeper Raintotem^^^^Lorekeeper Raintotem wants you to kill 8 Bristleback Interlopers at Red Rocks.^Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at Red Rocks, our sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend Thunder Bluff and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains. But it appears a foul menace has made its way onto our holy land. A band of Bristleback Interlopers is ravaging the grave site and I am too old and past my prime to drive them away. They must be driven off with force, <name>.Winds in the Desert^9^All^Durotar^Rezlak^Rezlak^Winds in the Desert^^^Retrieve 5 Sacks of Supplies and return them to Rezlak near Orgrimmar.^I'm Rezlak, one of Gazlowe's boys. Boss sent me to help the orcs here in Durotar. Things'd been going good except for the caravans. Can't manage to keep them safe! Makes my job a little harder, you know? The last shipment--they promised it'd get through!--was snatched by the Dustwind harpies of...where was it...Razorwind Canyon? I gotta have those supplies or I'll never get anything done! Follow the big canyon to the south, you'll find the ravine cut right into the west and east sides of the walls.Securing the Lines^11^All^Durotar^Rezlak^Rezlak^Winds in the Desert^^^Kill 12 Dustwind Savages and 8 Dustwind Storm Witches for Rezlak near Drygulch Ravine.^Gazlowe told me once, "Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself." I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Drygulch Ravine lies through the eastern part of Razorwind Canyon. If we kill all the harpies there, the routes will be safe. Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's "You can get anything done for a price." So, going to help me out, <name>?Rescue OOX-09/HL!^48^All^The Hinterlands^Homing Robot OOX-09/HL^Oglethorpe Obnoticus^Find OOX-09/HL!^^An OOX of Your Own^Escort OOX-09/HL to safety, then report to Oglethorpe Obnoticus in Booty Bay.^The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot: "I need to move OOX-09/HL to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure. It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again. Escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, some big rocks that obscure visibility! That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things online!" "Escort it safely and then come talk to me in Booty Bay! Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"Encroachment^10^Horde^Durotar^Gar'Thok^Gar'Thok^^^^Kill 4 Razormane Quilboars, 4 Razormane Scouts, 4 Razormane Dustrunners and 4 Razormane Battleguards for Gar'Thok at Razor Hill.^When we arrived, the Razormane quilboars possessed much of the land, and proved a thorn in our sides. Through our efforts we have driven out the largest part of their numbers, but still they remain well-fortified in some areas. It has gone on long enough, however. For our own protection, we cannot allow the Razormane any hold in our lands. Their camps can be found to the west of here. Look for the brambles and you will find them. Today we drive them from Durotar, tomorrow, perhaps from all of Kalimdor.Scholomance^55^Horde^Western Plaguelands^High Executor Derrington^Apothecary Dithers^Scholomance^All Along the Watchtowers^^Speak with Apothecary Dithers at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^On the island of Caer Darrow lies Scholomance - a school that serves as a stronghold for the Scourge. Our enemy dwells within, safely allowed to pursue research that strengthens their power. A door bars the way, and try as we might no entry is to be had without a proper key. Apothecary Dithers is well versed on Scholomance, and has an idea how to obtain a key. You have proved your value to me as someone who can get things done; I now entrust this task to you. Speak with him on this matter.Conscript of the Horde^12^Horde^Durotar^Takrin Pathseeker^Kargal Battlescar^Conscript of the Horde^^^Follow the western road from Razor Hill to the Barrens over a bridge.^Hmm, you look pretty strong. Listen, my good friend Kargal needs some new recruits for Barrens duty. I know you want to do what's right for the Horde. Well, this is your chance. Take this recruitment letter to Kargal and see if he'll sign it.Another Power Source?^46^Horde^Tanaris^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^^Slake That Thirst^^Bring 10 Wastewander Water Pouches to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle in Gadgetzan in exchange for another power source.^Let me guess - you didn't get whatever world-ending, nefarious deed you were doing done in time. No wait, better still... you dropped it in the sand! Well, whatever the reason, I do have additional power sources I will sell to you. This time, however, it will cost you ten, YES TEN Wastewander Water Pouches! Times are tough all around, <name>, and power sources don't grow on trees! Hrm, but what if they did. Maybe we could MAKE a power source tree...Crossroads Conscription^12^Horde^Durotar^Kargal Battlescar^Sergra Darkthorn^Conscript of the Horde^^^Follow the western road from Kargal's Far Watch Outpost.^Take this signed recruitment letter to the Crossroads. Sergra Darkthorn, curse her hide, is in charge there. She's a nasty shaman who will talk your head in circles before she lets you do anything useful. Thrall is convinced she's something special, but I'm not so sure. You'll just have to decide for yourself, pup...Gann's Reclamation^23^Horde^The Barrens^Gann Stonespire^Gann Stonespire^Gann's Reclamation^^^Gann Stonespire wants you to kill 15 Bael'dun Excavators and 5 Bael'dun Foremen.^In solitude I wander these roads. The dwarves of Bael Modan show no respect for my land. Horrendous blasts drive holes deep into the ground as noisy machines rip apart the hills. Lands which once served as home and provider to my tribe are now riddled with destructive dwarves. Attempts at reaching a diplomatic resolution have failed. Now is the time for decisive action. Drive the dwarves from the Bael Modan excavation by force and bring to me the journal of their leader, Prospector Khazgorm.Plainstrider Menace^12^Horde^The Barrens^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Collect 7 Plainstrider Beaks and return them to Sergra Darkthorn in the Crossroads.^Your first prey will be easy. The plainstriders to the east have been harassing our food supplies and have become a nuisance. Put down the plainstriders and return to me with their beaks.The Zhevra^13^Horde^The Barrens^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Slay Zhevra Runners to collect 4 Zhevra Hooves for Sergra Darkthorn in the Crossroads.^The zhevra, although not the fiercest beast in the Barrens, are a shade tougher than the plainstriders. Don't worry -- we'll send you against bigger prey in good time, but for now your teeth could use a little more cutting. Hunt the zhevra to the north and south, and collect their hooves. Bring them to me and perhaps we'll next send you against something tougher.Revenge of Gann^26^Horde^The Barrens^Gann Stonespire^Gann Stonespire^Gann's Reclamation^^^Gann Stonespire wants you to bring him 6 vials of Nitroglycerin, 6 bundles of Wood Pulp, and 6 samples of Sodium Nitrate.^It is clear the prospector depended on explosives and those noisy vehicles to rip the ground apart. We can expect a new foreman to take over soon. I want to give the dwarves a taste of their own medicine. According to these plans if we combine nitroglycerin with wood pulp and sodium nitrate we can create an explosive charge. The rifleman, soldiers and officers in the Keep are known to have the supplies. Collect these items and bring them to me. I will fashion a charge that the dwarves won't forget!Guile of the Raptor^37^Horde^Arathi Highlands^Gor'mul^Tor'gan^^Guile of the Raptor^^Speak with Tor'gan at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands.^This... this power.... Is this the power of the shamans that Tor'gan tried to show me? I must say, it is interesting. Tell Tor'gan that he has convinced me... for the time being. I will listen to what he has to say.Fungal Spores^15^Horde^The Barrens^Apothecary Helbrim^Apothecary Helbrim^^^Apothecary Zamah^Bring 4 Fungal Spores to Apothecary Helbrim at the Crossroads.^The oases of the Barrens hide a mystery. Life energy flows from their waters, invigorating the plants and beasts that drink it. Invigorating, and altering. There is a mushroom that grows near these oases. Its spores hold properties that we, the apothecaries of Lordaeron, find useful. Bring me these spores and you will earn our gratitude.Revenge of Gann^26^Horde^The Barrens^Gann Stonespire^Gann Stonespire^Gann's Reclamation^^^Destroy the flying machine at Bael Modan and return to Gann Stonespire.^Following Khazgorm's plans it should be no problem to fashion an explosive charge Ah, there we go. Now, <name>, I am going to entrust you with a special task. Take this explosive stick and use it to blow up the flying machine at Bael Modan. Not only is the flying machine a key part of the site's infrastructure it also serves as a weapon of war. More importantly it is an icon of power and an insult to the memory of my tribe. Make me proud by completing this heroic task and you shall be rewarded.Kolkar Leaders^16^Horde^The Barrens^Regthar Deathgate^Regthar Deathgate^^^Verog the Dervish^Bring Barak's Head to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads.^The centaurs have plagued the Tauren for years. And recently, the Kolkar centaurs of the Barrens have grown into a real threat. Normally they were disorganized in these lands, but new leaders have risen among them. Rallying them. To preserve our holdings here, these centaur leaders must be destroyed. Bring me the head of Barak Kodobane. He camps near the Forgotten Pools to the north. Defeat him, then return to me.Verog the Dervish^18^Horde^The Barrens^Regthar Deathgate^Regthar Deathgate^Verog the Dervish^Kolkar Leaders^^Bring Verog's Head to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads.^The centaur Verog the Dervish wanders the Barrens, and will be difficult to find. But he is based at the centaur command tent at the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast. It may be possible to draw him to you. Travel to the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast and attack centaur near the command tent. It will be dangerous, but if you can kill enough centaur then they should raise an alarm. And Verog will come. Bring me his head and I will place it with Barak Kodobane's.Hezrul Bloodmark^19^Horde^The Barrens^Regthar Deathgate^Regthar Deathgate^Verog the Dervish^^Counterattack!^Bring Hezrul's Head to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads.^Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the Kolkar centaurs in the Barrens. He is fierce, brutal and cunning. Defeating him would disrupt and fracture the Kolkars, greatly reducing their threat to us. So kill him. As with Barak and Verog, bring me Hezrul's Head. He leads his people from the Lushwater Oasis, to the south.Apothecary Zamah^15^Horde^The Barrens^Apothecary Helbrim^Apothecary Zamah^^Fungal Spores^^Bring the Rendered Spores to Apothecary Zamah in Thunder Bluff, before the time limit is up.^I have rendered the spores you gave me into an emulsion. I must now send it to my associate, Apothecary Zamah. If you were to carry this to her, she can offer you something from our stores of alchemical goods. She is in the Pools of Vision, a cave beneath the shamans of Thunder Bluff. The path to this cave is well hidden, but you may find it on the Spirit Rise bluff. Do hurry. This emulsion will maintain its potency for only a short time, and must be resealed and processed before then.Journey to the Crossroads^12^Tauren^Mulgore^Kirge Sternhorn^Thork^^^^Speak with Thork at the Crossroads in the Barrens.^I have foreseen your arrival, young <class>. Though perhaps you are not so young anymore. I think that it is time for you to move deeper into this land. I can sense that you are destined for great things. It is the Crossroads that you must seek out, for our lives with the orcs have become intertwined and they need assistance. Continue down this road towards the east and follow it north to the Crossroads. Find Thork within its walls, he has the Earthmother's blessing.Centaur Bracers^14^Horde^The Barrens^Regthar Deathgate^Regthar Deathgate^^^^Bring 15 Centaur Bracers to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads.^The Kolkar are a threat to the Horde's claims in the Barrens; we must reduce the numbers of their troops. And so, I have a bounty task for you. While in Kolkar territories, slay their warriors and collect centaur bracers. Return when you have a heap of bracers and the Horde will reward you well.The Tear of the Moons^30^Horde^The Barrens^Feegly the Exiled^Feegly the Exiled^^^^Feegly the Exiled wants you to retrieve for him the Tear of the Moons.^The power was mine! In my very hands! And I want it back! Back I say! Those dirty excavators uncovered it... so beautiful it was. Deemed the Tear of the Moons, it was the first great discovery we made at Bael Modan. It should have been mine! Mine I say! General Twinbraid grew jealous of the power it gave me. He locked it away in the Keep. Called it cursed, he did! The fool! Others wanted it and they had to be stopped! That fiend Twinbraid drove me off. Now I want it back. Back I say!Ignition^18^All^The Barrens^Wizzlecrank's Shredder^Wizzlecrank's Shredder^^^The Escape^Get the Ignition Key and bring it to Wizzlecrank.^I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem. We need to get out of here on the double! Go up to the control room at the top of the derrick, the supervisor should have a key for this shredder. Help me out here!Sergra Darkthorn^10^Horde^The Barrens^Melor Stonehoof^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^The Hunter's Way^^Speak with Sergra Darkthorn at the Crossroads in the Barrens.^If you wish to walk the hunter's path, then your journey leads to the Barrens. Its beasts are strong-willed and fierce. You will learn much by hunting there, and your spirit will grow. Speak with Sergra Darkthorn. She will be your first guide in the Barrens. Sergra is at the Crossroads. To reach her, travel east from Bloodhoof Village into the Barrens, then north as the road forks. And have care as you travel--the Barrens holds great danger for the unprepared and unwary.The Hunter's Way^10^Horde^Mulgore^Skorn Whitecloud^Melor Stonehoof^^^Sergra Darkthorn^Bring 4 Flatland Prowler Claws to Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^You are eager to explore, I can tell. I too had the lust to wander, once... Wander, and hunt. For hunting is a Tauren's greatest honor. If you truly wish to follow the ways of the hunter, then Melor Stonehoof can show you the path. He is in Thunder Bluff, on the Hunter's Rise. And to show him your skill and resolve, bring him the claws of the flatland prowlers of Mulgore. They are tough and cunning -- fitting prey for a young <class> on the hunter's path.Dig Rat Stew^23^Horde^Cooking^Grub^Grub^^^^Bring 8 Dig Rats to Grub east of the Crossroads.^A <class> like you must get pretty hungry out here in The Barrens. Me, I'm starving all day long. Tell you what, I'll fix you up a nice stew. Just need a few dig rats. Seems those filthy dwarves at Bael Modan are overrun with everyone's favorite feast. Now head on down south to Bael Modan and bring me back some dig rats. You can't call yourself a seasoned adventurer until you've spent some time killing rats! Haw!The Escape^18^All^The Barrens^Wizzlecrank's Shredder^Sputtervalve^^Ignition^^Protect Wizzlecrank and the stolen goblin shredder on the way to Sputtervalve in Ratchet.^I suppose I'll learn as we go... Couldn't be too hard. Just some buttons here, and a lever or two... Well, are you ready to go?Return to Apothecary Zinge^46^Horde^Undercity^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Apothecary Zinge^Tanaris Field Sampling^^^Bring the Sealed Field Testing Kit to Apothecary Zinge in the Undercity.^"Here you go, the power source is safely removed and the data is preserved. Well, safe journeys and all that. Hope the nefarious science experiment worked out for you and all." The goblin turns away from you to attend to the demands of the Gadgetzan Water Company. You secure the sealed testing kit for the journey back to the Undercity. Apothecary Zinge waits for you and the sealed field testing kit there.Raptor Horns^18^All^The Barrens^Mebok Mizzyrix^Mebok Mizzyrix^^^Smart Drinks^Gather 5 Intact Raptor Horns from Sunscale Scytheclaws, and bring them to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.^The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands. And I think all that smarts is hiding in their horns! If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make "smart drinks." I could sell them for a fortune!!! And you can help me. Find me intact raptor horns from sunscale scytheclaws. They roam in the southern Barrens, and in the northern Barrens near the border of Ashenvale Forest.Root Samples^16^All^Herbalism^Mebok Mizzyrix^Mebok Mizzyrix^^^^Bring 8 Root Samples to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.^The herbs of the Barrens are not quite like herbs in other lands. Their properties are mostly the same, but the oasis water here alters the plants; they are just slightly different. I want to study those differences... to see if they're exploitable! If you are skilled in herbalism, then gather root samples off the herbs you find in the Barrens. Bring back these samples so that I may compare them with herbs from other regions.Harpy Raiders^15^Horde^The Barrens^Darsok Swiftdagger^Darsok Swiftdagger^Harpy Raiders^^^Collect 8 Witchwing talons.^The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers. I've been snooping around their nests and figured out who leads who. The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top. I'll start you off slow, take out Witchwing Harpies and Witchwing Roguefeathers in the Northwest and bring me 8 Witchwing talons. That should be a good start...Egg Hunt^22^Horde^The Barrens^Korran^Korran^^^^Bring 12 Silithid Eggs and the Digging Claw to Korran at the Crossroads.^Hey, <name>. I been sent to the Crossroads to watch over the land and take note of its happenings for my masters in Orgrimmar. One object of my studies are the insect-like creatures found to the south in the Field of Giants. We know little of the creatures, so I be makin' it a point to discover more. They seem to have intelligence to them, more so than any normal animal. Take this digging claw and collect some of the creatures' eggs from their mounds, but be careful: if alerted, they will attack you.Raptor Thieves^13^Horde^The Barrens^Gazrog^Gazrog^Raptor Thieves^^^Bring 12 Raptor Heads to Gazrog at the Crossroads.^Not long ago, a shipment of silver was stolen from our guard tower. It was meant as payroll to the Crossroads' guards, and we want that silver back. The strange thing is... we caught one of the thieves on the night of the theft. And... it was a raptor! Unbelievable! I don't know what raptors would want with silver. But I don't care -- I want the raptors dead so they won't steal from us again! Hunt raptors in the Barrens. Collect for me their heads!The Forgotten Pools^13^Horde^The Barrens^Tonga Runetotem^Tonga Runetotem^The Barrens Oases^^^Report back to Tonga Runetotem with your findings.^Long ago, the Barrens was a lush place, teeming with life. But war and cataclysm raged across the land, scorching it and leaving a dry husk. Such is the way of things, and it saddens my heart. But within the past few years, new oases have formed in the Barrens, and life stirs. And deep down, we druids sense a power leaking its way to the surface. We must find its source. Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads. Search its waters for a source of power, then return here.Disrupt the Attacks^12^Horde^The Barrens^Thork^Thork^^^The Disruption Ends, Supplies for the Crossroads^Of the Razormane tribe, kill 8 Water Seekers, 8 Thornweavers and 3 Hunters, and then return to Thork in the Crossroads.^All the quilboars are our enemies, <name>. Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others. The Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply lines from Durotar, causing us no end of annoyance. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us. Start in the northeast towards Durotar. You can always tell their dens from the huge thorny vines that come up from the earth. Seek them out, and slay them.The Disruption Ends^15^Horde^The Barrens^Thork^Thork^^Disrupt the Attacks^^Kill 8 Razormane Geomancers, 8 Razormane Defenders, and Kreenig Snarlsnout.^One of my scouts witnessed an attack on a caravan from Durotar, <name>. The culprits are indeed the Razormane tribe of quilboars. One of the quilboars in particular is leading the raids: Kreenig Snarlsnout. He was seen northeast of here, just south of the road from Durotar. If the threat is to be ended, then Kreenig must die. To be sure the attacks cease, though, I say we add insult to their injury. Kill Kreenig along with more of their tribe, and return to me when you have his tusk.Isha Awak^27^Horde^The Barrens^Mahren Skyseer^Mahren Skyseer^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Bring the Heart of Isha Awak to Mahren Skyseer.^The grand Isha Awak is lord of these waters. Great is his strength, and solemn his pride. The humans on the coast fear him, for he has consumed many of their number. But I do not fear him. I am grateful he is here. He is a worthy challenge, and honorable prey. If you are ready, then swim out and search for Isha Awak, the Deep Doom. His spirit dwells in his heart, and to hear its beat is to know your fate.Mahren Skyseer^27^Horde^The Barrens^Jorn Skyseer^Mahren Skyseer^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Speak with Mahren Skyseer.^You have hunted the beasts of the Barrens. Your spirit is strong. But a hunter must always be prepared. A true hunter can stalk prey down any path. Mountains and swamps will not sway <him/her>. Not even the sea. Find my sister, Mahren. She hunts the great water beasts along the coast. She will be your teacher in their ways. But be wary in your search for her, for the Barrens' coast is held by humans.Harpy Lieutenants^16^Horde^The Barrens^Darsok Swiftdagger^Darsok Swiftdagger^Harpy Raiders^^^Collect 6 Harpy Lieutenant Rings from Witchwing Slayers and return them to Darsok Swiftdagger at the Crossroads.^Hahaha, <name>. Back for more? Good, I like to hear that. This time I want you to assassinate some of the harpy lieutenants in the Dry Hills. Only Witchwing Slayers can be lieutenants, and you can tell them apart by the rings they carry. They are a nasty bunch, but they lead some of the underlings in that area. Taking out 6 of them will be a decisive strike against their matriarchy. Make sure they die painfully, <name>. We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the Horde.Serena Bloodfeather^20^Horde^The Barrens^Darsok Swiftdagger^Darsok Swiftdagger^Harpy Raiders^^Letter to Jin'Zil^Slay Serena Bloodfeather and return her head to Darsok Swiftdagger at the Crossroads.^You did so well with the lieutenants and underlings that I'd like you to do one last thing for me. Serena Bloodfeather is the sister of a harpy named Bloodfeather who was slain by Rexxar quite a while ago. Apparently, these attacks on the Horde caravans are revenge for her sister's death. I need you to slit her throat and bring me back her head. I want to place it on the next caravan we send out... Give those harpies something to think about.The Stagnant Oasis^16^Horde^The Barrens^Tonga Runetotem^Tonga Runetotem^The Barrens Oases^^^Return to Tonga at The Crossroads, after investigating the Stagnant Oasis.^Like the one you found at the Forgotten Pools, there may be fissures at the other oases in the Barrens. If so, then perhaps the fissures are the oases' source of life. We must test this. Here, take these seeds. They are dead and infertile, but take them to the Stagnant Oasis to the southeast. If there is a fissure there, then place the seeds within it...and observe.Tribes at War^21^Horde^The Barrens^Mangletooth^Mangletooth^^^Blood Shards of Agamaggan^Kill 6 Bristleback Water Seekers, 12 Bristleback Thornweavers and 12 Bristleback Geomancers and return to Mangletooth at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.^You must strike my enemies. You must help Mangletooth and the Razormane by weakening the Bristlebacks. Both tribes are very spiritual--tied to the earth and its power. It gives us strength in all things... especially war. If you want to find out who really causes Thork and the Horde such anguish, then help Mangletooth! You attack the spiritual leaders of the Bristlebacks to the north; weaken them so the Razormanes can defeat them and rule the Barrens.Betrayal from Within^25^Horde^The Barrens^Mangletooth^Mangletooth^Betrayal from Within^Blood Shards of Agamaggan^^Kill Nak, Kuz, and Lok Orcbane and bring their skulls to Mangletooth at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.^Three of my tribe came out of the Kraul to lead the raids against the Horde, <race>. They are ruthless and cunning, and if you defeat them, then your Crossroads and even most of the Barrens will learn peace... at least from the Razormane tribe. Nak, Kuz, and Lok Orcbane are the ones you seek. They are far to the south of the Barrens. One is a spell caster, another a tracker, and their leader, the one called Orcbane, a warrior. Kill them, <race>, like they have killed me.Altered Beings^16^Horde^The Barrens^Tonga Runetotem^Tonga Runetotem^The Barrens Oases^^Hamuul Runetotem, Mura Runetotem^Bring 8 Altered Snapjaw Shells to Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads.^Your findings are incredible, <name>. These oases hold properties that must come from an outside source. Or perhaps an inside one. I want to know how these fissures are affecting the beasts who drink from the oases' water. Hunt oasis snapjaws at the Lushwater and Stagnant Oases. Bring me their shells so I may examine them.Echeyakee^16^Horde^The Barrens^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Bring Echeyakee's Hide to Sergra Darkthorn at the Crossroads.^Whitemist, Echeyakee in the Tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. And he kills so fast his prey have no time for fear, or pain. The Tauren say he is both mercy and death. You will learn if that's true, for I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is northeast of the Crossroads, among the bones of giant Kodo Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come.Ishamuhale^19^Horde^The Barrens^Jorn Skyseer^Jorn Skyseer^Sergra Darkthorn^^The Ashenvale Hunt^Bring Ishamuhale's Fang to Jorn at Camp Taurajo.^Ishamuhale, Speartooth, is the fiercest sunscale raptor of the Barrens. He does not hunt for sport, nor for food. He hunts because hunting is his passion. He kills because it is his nature to kill. And you will learn of his nature, <name>, for your path now follows the taloned tracks of Ishamuhale. Begin the hunt. Slay his favorite prey, a zhevra, then bring its carcass to the dead tree northwest of Ratchet. Ishamuhale will smell the carcass and be drawn to it. Be ready when he comes.Lakota'mani^22^Horde^The Barrens^Hoof of Lakota'mani^Jorn Skyseer^^^^Bring the Hoof of Lakota'mani to Jorn at Camp Taurajo.^The Hoof of Lakota'mani is a symbol of the strength of the great kodo.Owatanka^24^Horde^The Barrens^Owatanka's Tailspike^Jorn Skyseer^^^^Bring Owatanka's Tailspike to Jorn at Camp Taurajo.^When touched, sparks fly from the tailspike of Owatanka.Washte Pawne^25^Horde^The Barrens^Washte Pawne's Feather^Jorn Skyseer^^^^Bring Washte Pawne's Feather to Jorn Skyseer at Camp Taurajo.^The feather of Washte Pawne is painful to the touch.The Barrens Oases^10^Horde^The Barrens^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^Tonga Runetotem^The Barrens Oases^^^Speak with Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads in the Barrens.^The druids of Thunder Bluff sense a strange power leaking into the Barrens, east of Mulgore. Tonga Runetotem was sent to discover the source of this power, but we fear he will need aid. Travel to the Barrens and speak with Tonga. He will be at the Crossroads. To reach there, take the road east out of Bloodhoof village. Enter the Barrens, then turn north when the road forks. Continue north and you will find the Crossroads. And do not leave the road, <name>, for the Barrens is a harsh land.Southsea Freebooters^14^All^The Barrens^Gazlowe^Gazlowe^Southsea Freebooters^^^Kill 12 Southsea Brigands and 6 Southsea Cannoneers for Gazlowe in Ratchet.^I sure wish Vice Admiral Grezzlik did a better job of keeping the seas safe for our trading vessels. With all the gold the trade princes have poured into the Trade Fleets, it ticks me off to see so many pirates running willy-nilly, raiding my ships and stealing my goods! I heard that the Southsea Freebooters have set up a camp just south of here. They've been a real thorn in my side and if Grezzlik won't take care of them, well, maybe you can help me get rid of them.Stolen Booty^16^All^The Barrens^Gazlowe^Gazlowe^Southsea Freebooters^^^Retrieve the Shipment of Boots and Telescopic Lens for Gazlowe in Ratchet.^While I'd like to recover all my goods, I'm sure that's not possible. Still, there's a few things that I absolutely must have! As you see, my observatory is ready to go, but it needs the smaller of the two lenses. The first arrived by caravan from Durotar, but the second was bound by ship, and never arrived. Also, I never got my boot shipment from Drizzlik in Booty Bay! Head down to the pirate camp and see if you can find them.The Missing Shipment^14^All^The Barrens^Gazlowe^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^Southsea Freebooters^^^Bring Gazlowe's Ledger to Wharfmaster Dizzywig.^I've been waiting forever for my last shipment of goods from Booty Bay! I'm pretty sure that it must have been stolen by the Freebooters, but just to make sure, will you go down to the dockside and ask Dizzywig if my goods were already put into my warehouse without my knowledge? Here, take my ledger down to Dizzywig and have him double check my inventory records against his logs.The Guns of Northwatch^20^Horde^The Barrens^Captain Thalo'thas Brightsun^Captain Thalo'thas Brightsun^^^^Captain Thalo'thas Brightsun of Ratchet wants you to collect 10 Theramore Medals and slay Captain Fairmount, Cannoneer Whessan and Cannoneer Smythe.^Yet another ship from my fleet has been lost to those overzealous humans at Northwatch Hold! Those pests must be dealt with. Their paranoia has them in a state of frenzy. Trigger happy, reckless louts are shooting at anything in their sights. Travel south along the Merchant Coast to the Hold and lay siege to their forces. Bring me the medals of their soldiers as proof. And for the love of my fleet, slay Captain Fairmount and her overzealous cannoneers!The Missing Shipment^14^All^The Barrens^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^Gazlowe^Southsea Freebooters^^^Return Gazlowe's Ledger to Gazlowe in Ratchet.^Everything looks square from my records, <name>. Go on back and tell Gazlowe he's out of luck. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the pirates that nabbed his goodies. Nothing else I can do for him. Oh... though you could tell him that I've got some things from Undermine for him, when he has the time to come pick them up.Weapons of Choice^24^Horde^The Barrens^Tatternack Steelforge^Tatternack Steelforge^^^A New Ore Sample^Bring a Razormane Backstabber, a Charred Razormane Wand and a Razormane War Shield to Tatternack Steelforge at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.^The Razormane quilboars to the south, beyond the Field of Giants, have no skilled blacksmiths from what I am told, but they've apparently started to develop sturdier weapons. I'd like to get my hands on a few different types to learn their techniques if possible. If you wish to help bring honor to the Horde, then bring me examples of their weapons. Find me a dagger from their stalkers, a wand from their seers, and a shield from their warfrenzy. That should do nicely!Samophlange^14^All^The Barrens^Sputtervalve^Control Console^Samophlange^^^Access the control console at the Venture Company research site.^The Venture Company set up a small research facility far to the north of here, southwest of the Sludge Fen. I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a "samophlange". Now what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it. I obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it.WANTED: Baron Longshore^16^All^The Barrens^WANTED^Gazlowe^^^^Bring the head of Baron Longshore to Gazlowe in Ratchet.^WANTED! Baron Longshore, Captain of the Heedless Captain Longshore of Gilneas leads vessels of the Southsea Freebooters, and is wanted on charges of piracy. Remains must be in identifiable condition! -- GazloweMiner's Fortune^18^All^The Barrens^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^^^^Retrieve the Cats Eye Emerald from one of the Venture Co. Overseers or Enforcers for Wharfmaster Dizzywig at Ratchet.^Being Wharfmaster of a busy port like Ratchet, I keep my finger on the pulse of information. I know all about the exchange of goods and money between here and Booty Bay. The latest bit of news I've heard is about the Venture Company's Boulder Lode mine northeast of the Sludge Fen. One of the miners discovered an emerald the size of your fist. I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale.The Harvester^24^Horde^The Barrens^Harvester's Head^Jorn Skyseer^^^^Bring the Harvester's Head to Jorn Skyseer.^This strange, insect-like creature looks outside of the natural order, as though it does not belong in the Barrens.Free From the Hold^20^Horde^The Barrens^Gilthares Firebough^Captain Thalo'thas Brightsun^^^^Safely escort Gilthares Firebough back to Captain Brightsun in Ratchet.^Finally! Someone to rescue me! I can't believe you got past the guards. These zealots from Theramore are out of their minds. They sank our ship and imprisoned me, the only survivor. I was called an enemy and threat to the Alliance. Me! A threat to their great sham of an Alliance? I was a deckhand on a moonshine transport between Ratchet and Booty Bay. Enough talk. Help me get back to Ratchet will you? Let me know when you're ready and we'll make our break.Consumed by Hatred^20^Horde^The Barrens^Mankrik^Mankrik^^^^Bring 60 Bristleback Quilboar Tusks to Mankrik at the Crossroads.^Perhaps you know the pain of uncertainty, perhaps not, <class>. But know this: I stand here every day, from the sun's rising till its decline, scouring the horizon for more of those monsters. I've killed every pig man I've come across since, but my thirst for their blood is far from quenched. Perhaps instead of heading north to the Crossroads I should have headed to Taurajo. You, <class>--you could help me. Kill them. Kill as many as you can. Bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together.Samophlange^14^All^The Barrens^Control Console^Control Console^Samophlange^^^Close off the Fuel Control Valve, the Regulator Valve and the Main Control Valve then use the control console again.^The three control valves are currently opened. The various readings on the control panel lead you to presume that they must be shut off before the apparatus can be shut off.Samophlange^14^All^The Barrens^Control Console^Control Console^Samophlange^^^Get the Console Key from Tinkerer Sniggles to use on the control console.^With the apparatus deactivated, the control panel can be opened up and the samophlange removed from the console. With everything else in place, all that is left is to acquire the key to unlock the console.Samophlange^16^All^The Barrens^Control Console^Sputtervalve^Samophlange^^Wenikee Boltbucket^Return the Samophlange to Sputtervalve in Ratchet.^Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects--most of which seem to serve no practical purpose. Pushing them aside and digging deeper into the console, you find the samophlange. A tug removes it from its housing.Prowlers of the Barrens^15^Horde^The Barrens^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Collect 7 Prowler Claws from Savannah Prowlers for Sergra Darkthorn in the Crossroads.^Now it's time to go after something that really bites. The prowlers of the Barrens are a tough breed. Tough, resourceful, sly... and deadly. You'll find them among the tall grasses. You'll find many to the southwest of the Crossroads. Be wary as you hunt them, <name>, or you may find yourself no longer the predator, but instead the prey.The Angry Scytheclaws^17^Horde^The Barrens^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Kill Sunscale raptors and collect their feathers. Use the feathers on the 3 Scytheclaw nests. Return to Sergra Darkthorn in the Crossroads.^Now, <name>, the hunt deepens. Now you must defeat your prey, and then find your way to its lair. Hunt the sunscale raptors to the south. Slay them and remove the feathers they wear. Place the feathers on the scytheclaw nests southwest of the Stagnant Oasis. Show their brethren you do not fear them!Betrayal from Within^25^Horde^The Barrens^Mangletooth^Thork^Betrayal from Within^^^Bring Lok's Skull to Thork at the Crossroads in the Barrens.^Take Lok's head to Thork in the Crossroads, <race>. He should know what has happened to my tribe without any words--ha, not that he would believe Mangletooth helped in such things. But I am sure he'll reward you for carrying out such a great deed. I will continue to bless you with Agamaggan's power for as long as I remain in this cage, <race>. Until then, farewell.Enraged Thunder Lizards^18^Horde^The Barrens^Jorn Skyseer^Jorn Skyseer^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Bring 3 Thunder Lizard Blood to Jorn Skyseer at Camp Taurajo.^Now, <name>, you must face the great thunder lizards. So large are the beasts, the ground rumbles as they stomp across the plains. Take care as you fight them, for one false step and you may find yourself beneath their feet. You will find the thunder lizards in the southern Barrens. They are known as Stormsnouts, Stormhides and Thunderheads. Return to me after you have bested them.Cry of the Thunderhawk^20^Horde^The Barrens^Jorn Skyseer^Jorn Skyseer^Sergra Darkthorn^^^Find and slay a Thunderhawk, return its wings to Jorn Skyseer at Camp Taurajo.^The thunderhawk, <name>, is a fierce beast. It is time for you to face them. You must find where it roams, and bring me its wings as proof of your successful hunt. Do this, and your time with me will near its end.Leaders of the Fang^22^Horde^Wailing Caverns^Nara Wildmane^Nara Wildmane^Hamuul Runetotem^^^Bring the Gems of Cobrahn, Anacondra, Pythas and Serpentis to Nara Wildmane in Thunder Bluff.^The druids in the Wailing Caverns, the Druids of the Fang, are an aberration. They were part of an order of noble druids whose plan was to heal the Barrens, but now seek to remake that land to match their own, twisted dreams. The Druids of the Fang have four leaders, and each possesses a dream gem. Even now their faces haunt me! Defeat the leaders and bring me their gems, and the Barrens may again know peace. Go, <name>. You will find them lurking deep within the Wailing Caverns.Webwood Venom^4^All^Teldrassil^Gilshalan Windwalker^Gilshalan Windwalker^Webwood Venom^^^Bring 10 Webwood Venom Sacs to Gilshalan Windwalker at Aldrassil.^I came to Shadowglen to observe the webwood spiders that dwell in the Shadowthread Cave. They are cousin to a much smaller variety of spider; I believe the world tree has had a profound effect on them, and I would like specimens to study to confirm this. First, I would like some of their venom. Gather Webwood venom sacs from the spiders in and around the Shadowthread Cave, to the north. I can then examine them for similarities with their smaller cousin's venom.Webwood Egg^5^All^Teldrassil^Gilshalan Windwalker^Gilshalan Windwalker^Webwood Venom^^Tenaron's Summons^Bring a Webwood Egg to Gilshalan in Aldrassil.^Now that I have the spiders' venom, I'd like some live specimens to study. Unfortunately, capturing a living, giant spider is more than I can ask of you, young <class>. And a giant spider is more than I could handle myself! But if you can find an unhatched egg, then delivering specimens will be much easier, and I can then arrange for the unhatched spiders to be contained. There must be a nest deep in the Shadowthread Cave. Please, search for an egg in the nest and return it to me.Timberling Seeds^7^All^Teldrassil^Denalan^Denalan^Timberling Seeds^Denalan's Earth^^Bring 8 Timberling Seeds to Denelan at Lake Al'Ameth.^The timberlings of Teldrassil are elementals of nature. In some ways they reflect the natural order of plants and animals on our great tree. So it is disturbing to see how angry the timberlings have become. I believe it has something to do with the soil. I have been working on different methods of nurturing plants and would like to try them on timberling seeds. Please, can you gather seeds from timberlings around Lake Al'Ameth and bring them to me?Timberling Sprouts^7^All^Teldrassil^Denalan^Denalan^^Denalan's Earth^^Bring 12 Timberling Sprouts to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.^Small timberlings are sprouting around the waters of Lake Al'Ameth. I'm afraid these sprouts are beyond help -- we should try to clear them from the land before they grow large enough to cause trouble. When you're wandering the lake, if you see any timberling sprouts please take them. Help keep our land clean!Tenaron's Summons^5^All^Teldrassil^Gilshalan Windwalker^Tenaron Stormgrip^Tenaron's Summons^Webwood Egg^^Speak with Tenaron Stormgrip atop Aldrassil in Shadowglen.^<name>, is it? I heard that Tenaron has been asking for you. You'll find him in the highest room atop Aldrassil. We may live long lives, but it's best you not keep him waiting too long.Crown of the Earth^5^All^Teldrassil^Tenaron Stormgrip^Tenaron Stormgrip^Tenaron's Summons^^Crown of the Earth^Fill the Crystal Phial and bring it back to Tenaron Stormgrip atop Aldrassil.^It is time for you to set out to seek your destiny, <name>. But before you are ready to set out into the world beyond our enchanted forests, there is much you must learn about our recent history. Much has changed with our people since the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Nordrassil lies a pale shadow of what it once was, its power used to defeat Archimonde and drive back the Burning Legion... There is a task you must perform. Go to the moonwell north of Aldrassil and return me a phial of its water.Rellian Greenspyre^7^All^Teldrassil^Denalan^Rellian Greenspyre^Timberling Seeds^^^Bring a Timberling Seed to Rellian Greenspyre in Darnassus.^<name>, can you take one of the seeds you brought me to my friend, Rellian Greenspyre? He is a druid in Darnassus, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings. He had some ideas himself, and he will appreciate a specimen seed to work with. Thank you, <name>. You have been a great help to me. I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors. You will usually find Rellian walking the pathways of the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus.Tumors^9^All^Teldrassil^Rellian Greenspyre^Rellian Greenspyre^Timberling Seeds^^Return to Denalan^Bring 5 Mossy Tumors to Rellian Greenspyre in Darnassus.^There is a malevolence growing in the timberlings. We are trying to find the source, but until we do...in order to keep Teldrassil safe we must cut down the timberlings who are beyond help. Those that wander Wellspring Lake in northern Teldrassil are the most tainted. They must be removed! Destroy the Timberlings you find there, and gather the mossy tumors growing upon them. Bring the tumors to me so that they may be burned.The Demon Seed^14^Horde^Durotar^Ak'Zeloth^Ak'Zeloth^Neeru Fireblade^^^Grab a Flawed Power Stone. Bring it to the Altar of Fire before the stone expires, then return to Ak'Zeloth.^The Demon Seed is a powerful tool for the Burning Legion. It rests in a cave on Dreadmist Peak, above a demonic altar of fire. I have prepared power stones that when placed near the Seed will disrupt its connection to the Legion. Take a stone from the table and bring it to the altar of fire atop Dreadmist Peak. Travel west, then north when the road forks. The Peak will be to your left. The safest climb to the top is on its northern face. And hurry--the stone's power will consume itself in time.The Moss-twined Heart^12^All^Teldrassil^Moss-twined Heart^Denalan^^^Planting the Heart^Bring the Moss-twined Heart to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.^The heart of Blackmoss the Fetid is covered with a dark, oily moss. In fact, the only way to tell this is a heart is from its slow, rhythmic beat... A beat that continues even now. Perhaps Denalan will want to see this heart.Crown of the Earth^5^All^Teldrassil^Tenaron Stormgrip^Corithras Moonrage^^Crown of the Earth^Crown of the Earth^Bring the Partially Filled Vessel to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar.^While there is more I could speak to you of the moonwells and of Teldrassil, I must send you along. Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him. Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from Aldrassil out of Shadowglen, and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west. Mind you stay on the road though, <name>. There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late.Crown of the Earth^5^All^Teldrassil^Corithras Moonrage^Corithras Moonrage^Crown of the Earth^Crown of the Earth^^Fill the Jade Phial and bring it back to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar.^First, let me tell you more of the task you must complete. The druids in Darnassus use the water of the moonwells of Teldrassil, and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells. Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of Starbreeze Village to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. When you have completed your task, I shall continue the story where Tenaron left off...The Glowing Fruit^10^Alliance^Teldrassil^Strange Fruited Plant^Denalan^^^^Bring the glowing fruit to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.^Hanging from beneath its fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit. Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain.The Shimmering Frond^10^All^Teldrassil^Strange Fronded Plant^Denalan^^^The Sprouted Fronds^Bring a Shimmering Frond to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth^The fronds on this plant shimmer in the forest light, giving it a twisting, pulsing aura. You believe that Denalan would want a specimen of this.Twisted Hatred^7^All^Teldrassil^Tallonkai Swiftroot^Tallonkai Swiftroot^^^^Kill Lord Melenas and bring his head to Tallonkai Swiftroot in Dolanaar.^I must warn you, <name>, this matter must stay between us. The satyr are enough of an embarrassment to us already, and this one is much too close to home. He is called Lord Melenas. He resides in the nearby cave of Fel Rock where he has gathered a large group of grell warriors. His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul. You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head.Crown of the Earth^9^All^Teldrassil^Corithras Moonrage^Corithras Moonrage^Crown of the Earth^^Crown of the Earth^Fill the Tourmaline Phial and bring it back to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar.^There is another moonwell southeast of the entrance to Darnassus, on the shores of the Pools of Arlithrien. The Sentinels are having problems patrolling the area because of attacks and the growing ill-temperedness of the Gnarlpine furbolgs. Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand.Crown of the Earth^11^All^Teldrassil^Corithras Moonrage^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^Crown of the Earth^^^Bring the Filled Vessel to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.^Without the blessings of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder and Nozdormu the Timeless, Teldrassil's growth has not been without flaw. Strange beasts have been reported arising from the very ground of the tree, and crazed furbolgs attack passing travelers. I can only hope that the solution the Arch Druid is looking for will be found quickly. I will pour all the phials you brought into this vessel, for you to deliver to Darnassus. Bring it to Fandral Staghelm, you will find him in the druid grove.Assisting Arch Druid Runetotem^50^Horde^Orgrimmar^Innkeeper Gryshka^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^Assisting Arch Druid Runetotem^^Un'Goro Soil^Speak with Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem in Thunder Bluff.^Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible. The Cenarion Circle in Thunder Bluff is most interested in seasoned adventurers such as yourself to lend them aid in a vital research project. While I do not know the specifics, I can inform you that none other than Hamuul Runetotem is spearheading this research. Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly on the Elder Rise within Thunder Bluff proper.The Enchanted Glade^11^All^Teldrassil^Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak^Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak^^^Teldrassil^Acquire 6 Bloodfeather Belts and bring them to Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak in the Oracle Glade.^I was dispatched with a small group of Sentinels here to protect the Oracle Tree from the harpies that have made nests all around the glade. Little by little we are trying to push them back. When the Oracle Tree attempted to send a runner to Darnassus with a report, the messenger was attacked and killed by a group of the harpies. If you feel up to the task, go to their nests, slay them, and return their belts to me as proof of your deeds.Mist^12^All^Teldrassil^Mist^Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak^^^^Escort Mist to Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak at the moon well near the Oracle Tree.^The sabercat's fur is a distinctive gray color, blending into the surrounding forest. As she lays there, you observe that she is badly wounded, with deep lacerations across her back and stomach. She raises her head and gazes at you, bright intelligence shining in blue eyes. She seems to wish to follow you.Flute of Xavaric^54^Alliance^Felwood^Flute of Xavaric^Eridan Bluewind^Flute of Xavaric^^^Bring the Flute of Xavaric and 5 Jadefire Felbind samples to Eridan Bluewind in southern Felwood.^You study the simple wooden flute you picked up after defeating Xavaric. The knotted wood feels solid, but it seems as if the spirals and patterns in the surface begin to spin and move as you turn it over in your hands. Suddenly, you feel a sense of dread... You shake your head, sure that your mind is playing tricks on you. It's possible that other satyrs carry clues as to what you have found. Bring your findings to the druid, Eridan Bluewind, that lives in southern Felwood.Teldrassil^11^All^Teldrassil^Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^Teldrassil^The Enchanted Glade^^Deliver the Oracle Tree's report to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.^The forest whispers of your feats of valor, <name>. As I felt the harpies forced from their nests, a greater calm spread across the forest, its creatures once again feeling safe. I have feared sending another messenger to the Arch Druid, but I know that you will see my message safely to him. Deliver this to him and know that the forest will see you safely along its paths to the forest of stone.Planting the Heart^12^Alliance^Teldrassil^Denalan^Denalan's Planter^^The Moss-twined Heart^^Plant the Tainted Heart in Denalan's Planter.^I have removed that foul moss from the heart, but it remains tainted... Try placing the heart in my planter. It is filled with a nutritive soil that may cleanse and heal the heart.The Absent Minded Prospector^20^All^Darkshore^Chief Archaeologist Greywhisker^Archaeologist Flagongut^The Absent Minded Prospector^^^Take the mysterious fossil to Archaeologist Flagongut in Menethil Harbor.^This fossil bears a striking resemblance to one I once saw in Ironforge. An archaeologist by the name of Flagongut brought it to our annual Explorers' League conference. He believed the fossil had a power which could be unlocked somehow. Last I heard Flagongut had holed up in the Deepwater Tavern in Menethil Harbor, awaiting escort to the Whelgar Excavation Site. Seek him out and show him Remtravel's fossil. Perhaps he can reveal the secrets of the past. Good luck findin' your way there!The Absent Minded Prospector^24^All^Darkshore^Archaeologist Flagongut^Archaeologist Flagongut^The Absent Minded Prospector^^^Archaeologist Flagongut in Menethil Harbor wants you to bring him the Stone of Relu and Flagongut's Fossil.^Prospector Whelgar now holds the original fossil at his site in the Wetlands. When I discovered the Stone of Relu, I believed it to be the key to unlocking the mystery of the fossil. While I traveled on the road to meet Whelgar, I was attacked by raptors and the relic was lost. I don't know which one of the mottled beasts swallowed the relic but if you can retrieve it, I can unleash the power of these artifacts. Bring me both the Stone of Relu, and the original fossil he holds.The Master's Glaive^17^All^Darkshore^Onu^Scrying Bowl^Cave Mushrooms^^^Gather information, then use the Phial of Scrying to create a Scrying Bowl. Use the bowl to speak with Onu.^It is strange that the naga are here, in Darkshore. But stranger still...are the Twilight's Hammer. That cult worships the old, old lords of the earth. Lords defeated long ago. The Master's Glaive, to the south, is a place where such an old lord fell. Go there and look for more Twilight's Hammer cultists. Take this phial of scrying. Use it to create a scrying bowl after searching the Master's Glaive. Then speak to me through the bowl.Therylune's Escape^18^All^Darkshore^Therylune^Therysil^^^^Help Therylune escape, then tell Therysil at the Shrine of Aessina in Ashenvale that her sister is safe.^Help! I was wandering around the Master's Glaive, and these dirty cultists surrounded me. Lucky I'm good at hiding!! Can you help me out of here? And I need to send word to my sister Therysil that I'm all right. She's in Ashenvale to the south, at the Shrine of Aessina.Cave Mushrooms^17^All^Darkshore^Barithras Moonshade^Barithras Moonshade^Cave Mushrooms^^^Bring 5 Scaber Stalks and 1 Death Cap to Barithras Moonshade in Auberdine.^I am devising a potion that requires rare mushrooms, mushrooms that grow only in a certain cave. The cave lies behind Cliffspring Falls, to the east and slightly north along the mountains. I would go there myself, but I was advised by the Grove of the Ancients to stay away from that place. Our venerable allies sense that the cave is the hiding place for a new evil in Darkshore. Please, <name>, gather the mushrooms for me. And while doing so, scout the cave to confirm the Ancients' fears.Onu^17^All^Darkshore^Barithras Moonshade^Onu^Cave Mushrooms^^^Speak with Onu at the Grove of the Ancients.^Onu, an Ancient of Lore at the Grove of the Ancients, knows of your journey to Cliffwater Falls and wishes to speak with you. The grove lies to the south, nestled near the mountains. The Ancients are patient and wise, <name>. But if Onu seeks your counsel concerning what you saw in the falls, then I fear it is urgent.The Twilight Camp^17^All^Darkshore^Scrying Bowl^Twilight Tome^Cave Mushrooms^^^Find a clue in the Twilight's Hammer camp at the Master's Glaive.^The Twilight's Hammer's purpose at the Master's Glaive is not known. But it must be dark. Search through their camp at the Glaive... Search for some thing that may teach us their intentions. For we must learn their intentions before a plan is made.Return to Onu^17^All^Darkshore^Twilight Tome^Onu^Cave Mushrooms^^Mathystra Relics^Bring Onu the recovered Insane Scribbles.^Peering into the Twilight Tome is maddening. Text begins to swim and dance after only a moment's glance, and once beautiful scrollwork twists into grotesque shapes. Tearing away one page of insane scribbles is all that is possible before a swoon overtakes you.Mathystra Relics^20^All^Darkshore^Onu^Onu^^Return to Onu^^Bring 6 Mathystra Relics to Onu at the Grove of the Ancients.^The parchment you found at the Master's Glaive is a page from an ancient text...written by elves! It is heavily cursed and tainted by the corruption of the Twilight's Hammer, but it seems the cult is using ancient elven magic to bring their old masters back to our world. Travel to the ruins of Mathystra to the northeast, and search for ancient relics among the grass and broken stones. Through their study, we may divine how the Twilight's Hammer intends to exploit the magic of the elves.Grove of the Ancients^11^All^Darnassus^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^Onu^Teldrassil^^^Deliver Fandral's message to Onu in the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, south of Auberdine.^If you had enough time to run messages for the Oracle Tree, then I'm sure that I can press you into service to deliver a message to the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, due south of Auberdine. You will most likely have to secure transport on a hippogryph, but I have faith enough in you that you can manage that. Take this to Onu, the Ancient of Lore. He has been awaiting word from me, even as I waited for news from the Oracle Glade.The Fall of Ameth'Aran^12^All^Darkshore^Sentinel Tysha Moonblade^Sentinel Tysha Moonblade^^^^Study the tablets which tell of Ameth'Aran and of its fall, then return to Sentinel Tysha Moonblade in Darkshore.^To the east you will find the ruins of Ameth'Aran. It is now inhabited by the restless spirits of the Highborne that once dwelt within its walls, but once it was a place where the servants of Azshara freely practiced their powerful magics. I was sent to explore the ruins and came across two large tablets, scrawled with the stories of Ameth'Aran and its fall. While I read the runes, I was accosted by the spirits, and fled. Please, if you can, venture to the ruins and decipher the tablets in my place.Bashal'Aran^12^All^Darkshore^Thundris Windweaver^Asterion^Bashal'Aran^^^Find the source of the strange blue aura in the ruins of Bashal'Aran.^The ruins of Bashal'Aran to the east are overrun with demonic minions. The sprites and satyrs that have taken up residence in the area feed upon the magical energies of the area, their powers growing from continued exposure. Even with that, I have noticed that there is one shrine they will not approach. On the western side of the ruins, atop a small bluff, a strange blue aura permeates... There must be an explanation to the demons' reluctance. I would like you to investigate it.Bashal'Aran^12^All^Darkshore^Asterion^Asterion^Bashal'Aran^^^Acquire 8 Grell Earrings for Asterion in Bashal'Aran.^If I were to relate the story of my life, I have no doubt it would surpass the limits of your patience. Let us say that mine has been a long and painful life, and this spectral form is perhaps the worst torment of all. I am held here by the means of magic. Though my words may seem disingenuous, I assure you I would be grateful beyond words if you would help me find the means of my imprisonment. A seal binds me, and by examining the earpieces of the sprites and grells, I may find a trace of it.Bashal'Aran^13^All^Darkshore^Asterion^Asterion^Bashal'Aran^^^Obtain the Ancient Moonstone Seal and bring it to Asterion in Bashal'Aran.^If the grells have come into close contact with the seal that binds my eternal prison, I suspect I know the cause. No doubt the seal has come into the possession of the satyr that lead them. I feel strongly that this must be true, <name>. One of the satyr must surely possess it. If you can obtain it, you would bring me so close to passing the bars of my prison that tears would come to my eyes.Bashal'Aran^13^All^Darkshore^Asterion^Asterion^Bashal'Aran^^^Destroy the Ancient Moonstone Seal at the ancient flame in Ameth'Aran, then return to Asterion in Bashal'Aran.^It was the craft of one of the most powerful of the Highborne that created the seal that formed my prison. In Ameth'Aran, the ruins to the south that are twin to these, persists even today an ancient flame, blue in color. In this flame this seal could be destroyed. Be wary in the ruins, <name>...Tools of the Highborne^12^All^Darkshore^Thundris Windweaver^Thundris Windweaver^^^^Retrieve 7 Highborne Relics for Thundris Windweaver in Auberdine.^<class>. A task I would ask of you. Have you seen the ruins of Ameth'Aran? If not, you will find them on the eastern side of the main road, some ways to the south. Once they were the home of many powerful Highborne, now they are a testament to the destruction their dabblings produced. I have been told by the Sentinels that the spirits of the Highborne persist, and that they wield their ancient magical implements. Those relics must be appropriated, so that we might destroy them.Trouble at the Docks^18^All^Wailing Caverns^Crane Operator Bigglefuzz^Crane Operator Bigglefuzz^^^^Crane Operator Bigglefuzz in Ratchet wants you to retrieve the bottle of 99-Year-Old Port from Mad Magglish who is hiding in the Wailing Caverns.^Oops! Had a little mishap, as you can see! The morning cargo shipment from Booty Bay was huge. Huge I say! Never seen so many crates. Well, I was trying to expedite things so I started unloading a bit more than I could handle. That's when everything came tumbling down. Before I knew what was going on, I saw that menace, Mad Magglish, go running off with a bottle of 99-year-old port. Chased him all the way to Wailing Caverns. No way I was going in there. Maybe you're brave enough to find him?Serpentbloom^18^Horde^Wailing Caverns^Apothecary Zamah^Apothecary Zamah^^^^Apothecary Zamah in Thunder Bluff wants you to collect 10 Serpentbloom.^The Royal Apothecary Society, based in the great Undercity of Lordaeron, has sent me here for a very specific service, <name>. Perhaps you wish to aid me, and in turn The Dark Lady in our efforts to advance the Forsaken. Recently I studied a rare specimen of flora named Serpentbloom. I believe in greater quantities this herb has great potential. Unfortunately Serpentbloom can only be found in the darkest recesses of the Wailing Caverns, a dangerous cave system located in the Barrens.For Love Eternal^16^All^Darkshore^Cerellean Whiteclaw^Cerellean Whiteclaw^^^^Free the spirit of Anaya Dawnrunner and bring her pendant back to Cerellean Whiteclaw in Auberdine.^In the aftermath of the battles at the Well of Eternity, I heard that Ameth'Aran had been destroyed, its people dead, including my love, Anaya. I would never have thought, thousands of years later, that memories of Anaya would still haunt my dreams. Wandering the woods of Darkshore in a stupor, I found myself in the ruins of Ameth'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved. She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed.Skeletal Fragments^57^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Apothecary Dithers^Apothecary Dithers^Scholomance^^^Bring 15 Skeletal Fragments to Apothecary Dithers at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key. It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold. A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function. First thing's first though, <name>. We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging. Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too.The Tower of Althalaxx^18^All^Darkshore^Sentinel Elissa Starbreeze^Balthule Shadowstrike^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Find Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx in Darkshore.^Hail, young <race>. I am Elissa Starbreeze, and it is my charge to protect Auberdine from harm. To this end, I sent Balthule Shadowstrike to observe the strange happenings around the Tower of Althalaxx to the northeast. It is past time that he should have returned. I worry that he has encountered some unforeseen danger in the forest. I would be most appreciative if you would find him and see that he is doing well.The Tower of Althalaxx^18^All^Darkshore^Balthule Shadowstrike^Balthule Shadowstrike^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Collect 4 Worn Parchments for Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx.^A group of warlocks has taken up residence around and inside the tower. I would have returned to Auberdine to report to Elissa earlier, but I was afraid that I might miss something while I was away. Delgren suspected such a company might be gathering at the tower, but did not know why. A few scraps of parchment that the warlocks carry have found their way to my hands, but I need more to complete the puzzle. I warn you not to venture into the tower, however, the warlocks there are much more powerful!The Tower of Althalaxx^18^All^Darkshore^Balthule Shadowstrike^Delgren the Purifier^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Deliver Balthule's letter to Delgren the Purifier in Ashenvale Forest.^My master, Delgren the Purifier, is a paladin who has graciously offered his assistance in defending our forests from the forces of the demons and undead. He has taught me much about the Holy Light and the art of battle. Delgren must know of the cult's operations immediately. You will find him far south of here at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale Forest.

On the inside cover of the book are the words: "Bonegrip's Runes and Dooms, The Forlorn Cavern, Ironforge. Proprietor: Gerrig Bonegrip." If Bonegrip sells books like this, perhaps he'll buy this one back.Luck Be With You^60^All^Winterspring^Witch Doctor Mau'ari^Witch Doctor Mau'ari^Luck Be With You^^^Collect 4 Frostmaul Shards for Witch Doctor Mau'ari in Everlook.^Ah, I can tell just by lookin' at ya -- you be wantin' to make a lucky charm.

This Cult of the Dark Strand is a thorn in my side that must be removed. I have been dealing with some of the Dark Strand scum northeast of here at Ordil'Aran. One of their number possesses a soul gem that I believe holds the secret to the cult's power. Bring it to me, and I will be able to decipher the secrets held within.Knowledge in the Deeps^23^Alliance^Blackfathom Deeps^Gerrig Bonegrip^Gerrig Bonegrip^^^^Bring the Lorgalis Manuscript to Gerrig Bonegrip in the Forlorn Cavern in Ironforge.^As you might know, I collect lore. Old lore. Powerful lore. Lore that opens doorways, and lore that can awaken Those Who Sleep. There are rumors of an old piece of lore, the Lorgalis Manuscript, at the bottom of Blackfathom Deeps in Ashenvale. That place is the old dwelling of long-dead elves. Elves who held great knowledge before their city fell to ruin. Search Blackfathom Deeps for the manuscript. Do this, and I will not forget it. Not even after ... the end days.The Tower of Althalaxx^24^All^Darkshore^Delgren the Purifier^Delgren the Purifier^The Tower of Althalaxx^The Tower of Althalaxx^Supplies to Auberdine^Bring Ilkrud Magthrull's Tome to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post.^Ilkrud Magthrull. Yes, I have knowledge of him. He is a powerful orc warlock that makes his residence at the Fire Scar Shrine, a place of great evil in southwestern Ashenvale. He had been little more than an annoyance until now, and I had not dealt with him, but it seems that his time has come.Finding the Source^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Krakle^Krakle^Finding the Source^^^Krakle in Un'Goro Crater wants you to find the hottest area of Fire Plume Ridge.^The hot springs here are a source of mystery to me. Where does the heat come from? Looking at how close the pools are to Fire Plume Ridge, I really wonder if the volcano might have something to do with it. I created a thermometer to take readings of the temperatures at the volcano, and I'd like to find the hottest part. It gives the measurements in degrees Kraklenheit! Here, take it, and take readings of the temperatures at the ridge whenever you see a hot spot!Cache of Mau'ari^60^All^Winterspring^Witch Doctor Mau'ari^Witch Doctor Mau'ari^Luck Be With You^^Frostsaber E'ko, Winterfall E'ko, Shardtooth E'ko, Chillwind E'ko, Ice Thistle E'ko, Frostmaul E'ko, Wildkin E'ko^Speak to Witch Doctor Mau'ari again in a moment to receive the lucky charm.^Now, before I give ya dis charm, I better explain how ta use it.

Dangerous foes operate in the forest, and I do not wish to risk letting these supplies and information fall into the wrong hands. If you and others could act as my guards, I could leave now. With your protection, I have no doubt that we can see these goods safely to Auberdine.Are We There, Yeti?^58^All^Winterspring^Umi Rumplesnicker^Umi Rumplesnicker^Are We There, Yeti?^^^Collect 2 Pristine Yeti Horns for Umi Rumplesnicker in Everlook.^Now that I have what I need to cover the mechanical moving parts, I only need one other thing. Well, actually two. Two horns! The ice thistle patriarchs and matriarchs have the largest horns, so of course, those are the ones I want. That type of yeti inhabits a cave to the southeast. There are plenty of them there; you shouldn't have any problem finding them. Remember, I only want the best looking ones -- no beat up or broken horns, please!Moontouched Wildkin^55^Alliance^Teldrassil^Erelas Ambersky^Erelas Ambersky^Moontouched Wildkin^Favored of Elune?^^Collect 10 Moontouched Feathers from Winterspring, then return to Erelas Ambersky in Rut'theran Village.^Wildkin feathers from the Hinterlands appear to contain traces of magical qualities. These powers... they don't seem to be wielded by the creatures, it's more like they are simply inherent to the species -- part of their very essence. During my studies, I heard that a large population of wildkin inhabit the snowy lands of Winterspring. Could these creatures have the same powers? Please help me find an answer, <name>. Go to Winterspring and gather feathers that have dropped to the ground, then return to me.Find Ranshalla^57^Alliance^Winterspring^Erelas Ambersky^Ranshalla^Moontouched Wildkin^^Guardians of the Altar^Find Ranshalla in eastern Winterspring.^Yes, yes, these feathers seem to hold the same magical enchantment that I noticed previously... While I am not certain what we might find, I urge you to continue searching for answers, <name>. A colleague of mine recently traveled into Winterspring to observe the wildkin there, in their own habitat. Why don't you catch up with her and see what she has found?The New Springs^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Krakle^Donova Snowden^Finding the Source^^^Travel to Winterspring and speak with Donova Snowden.^Now, I've heard about other hot springs in a place called Winterspring, far to the north of here. The strange thing is, there are no volcanoes anywhere near them. Interesting, I know. Well, if you want to find out more, you should head to Winterspring and speak to a friend of mine. Her name is Donova Snowden, and she is currently staying by the hot springs there. Thanks again for helping me with my thermometer! See you later!The Tower of Althalaxx^31^All^Darkshore^Balthule Shadowstrike^Delgren the Purifier^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Talk to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post.^For all the work that you have done, you deserve to be well rewarded. Return to Delgren and tell him that Athrikus Narassin lies stilled by your hand, and the Cult of the Dark Strand is beaten and scattered.Deep Ocean, Vast Sea^17^All^Darkshore^Gorbold Steelhand^Gorbold Steelhand^^^^Recover the Silver Dawning's Lockbox and the Mist Veil's Lockbox for Gorbold Steelhand in Auberdine. Both items should be found aboard the wreckage of the ships to the north of the village.^Off the coast of Darkshore to our north are two wrecked ships - the Silver Dawning and the Mist Veil. Some time ago, both ships ran afoul of the blasted murlocs as they sailed across the vast sea into Auberdine. They now lie at the bottom of the ocean as trophies for those fiends. Both captains didn't make it out that night, and their logs and other effects are still below in lockboxes. I'd like for you to recover them for us; it would mean a lot to the crew members still around these parts.Buzzbox 827^10^All^Darkshore^Wizbang Cranktoggle^Buzzbox 827^Buzzbox 827^^^Collect 6 Crawler Legs and place them in Buzzbox 827.^Hey! Help me with my latest invention, the buzzbox. You can talk to people far away! Maybe you've already seen them, they're boxes with levers on them. The only problem is they need constant maintenance. Each one suffers from a different problem, but I made a really smart decision. I placed each one near creatures that have the proper parts to fix that particular machine. Right now Buzzbox 827 is on the fritz. It's just south of Auberdine, real close. It takes 6 Crawler Legs to fix it. I'll pay ya...How Big a Threat?^14^All^Darkshore^Terenthis^Terenthis^How Big a Threat?^^Thundris Windweaver^Find a corrupt furbolg camp in Darkshore and return to Terenthis in Auberdine.^Some of my brethren were rescued from a corrupt furbolg in Teldrassil, and I've vowed to stop any more atrocities before more of our kind are injured... or worse. I have seen a couple hints of corruption in Darkshore already, but I have yet to find any widespread signs. I think it would be logical if the investigation continued with the furbolgs. Would you find one of their camps, and return to me if you see any signs of corruption?How Big a Threat?^14^All^Darkshore^Terenthis^Terenthis^How Big a Threat?^^A Lost Master^Kill 8 Blackwood Pathfinders and 5 Windtalkers and return to Terenthis in Auberdine.^You've already proven adept at scouting our enemy, <name>. Do you have what it takes to fight them as well? Not all adventurers prefer straightforward combat to the art of stealth and evasion. If you think you're up for the task, then the furbolg camp south of Auberdine is currently the biggest threat to our people. You'll find some of the Blackwood tribe there. Kill 8 pathfinders and 5 windtalkers, and return to me here.A Lost Master^20^All^Darkshore^Terenthis^Terenthis^^How Big a Threat?^A Lost Master^Find 5 Fine Moonstalker Pelts and return them to Terenthis in Auberdine.^<name>, your skills have already helped me in my endeavor. Could I impose on you again to help Grimclaw and his master Volcor? In addition, I can craft you a magical cloak that will allow you to walk unhindered by Darkshore's creatures while you look for him. To create the cloak, I'll need five fine moonstalker pelts from a moonstalker sire or matriarch to have enough material. The cats can be found near Wildbend River to the south, or even farther south near Ashenvale.Trek to Ashenvale^19^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Selarin^Raene Wolfrunner^^^^Find Raene Wolfrunner in Ashenvale.^<name>, my mistress, Raene Wolfrunner, awaits you in the city of Astranaar within Ashenvale. With your help, perhaps we can at least ease some of the corruption that's taken hold there. Head south from here and stay close to the road--you'll find your way there without issue if you follow those directions.Raene's Cleansing^19^Alliance^Ashenvale^Raene Wolfrunner^Teronis' Corpse^Raene's Cleansing^^^Find Teronis in Ashenvale.^<name>, a longtime friend of mine is also aiding the Sentinels here in Ashenvale, but he has yet to return. He had leads on finding an item that he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard. Before he left here, he mentioned seeking out a gem for the rod. He mentioned the gem possibly being hidden at the shrine in Lake Falathim at the base of the mountain to the west. The gem was being held there before it was overrun. Find my friend, <name>, please.Gadgetzan Water Survey^46^All^Tanaris^Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser^Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser^Gadgetzan Water Survey^^^Use the untapped dowsing widget near the pool of water by Sandsorrow Watch. Once you have collected the sample, return the tapped dowsing widget to Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser in Gadgetzan.^We've got a position open for a temporary junior-grade surveyor in the Gadgetzan Water Company, if you're interested! With the nomads seizing all our wells, we need to exploit more free sources of water! There is water to be had in the desert, but only to those smart enough to survey them first. Take this dowsing widget and tap a sample of the water by the pool near Sandsorrow Watch. It's right in sight of the trolls around there. Bring the tapped widget back to me when you're done!A Lost Master^20^All^Darkshore^Terenthis^Volcor^^A Lost Master^Escape Through Force, Escape Through Stealth^Find Volcor in Darkshore and give him the Enchanted Moonstalker Cloak.^The cloak is complete, <name>. The time has come to find Volcor. I can only hope we are in time. The cloak's magic, once invoked, will not last long; perhaps five minutes. It will be up to you to know when to use it: I would suggest waiting until you find Grimclaw. If what he has told me is true, you will find his master in a cave south of here. Grimclaw will be alongside the road waiting for you. Signal to him by waving when you see him, and he'll point the way towards his master.Escape Through Force^22^All^Darkshore^Volcor^Terenthis^^A Lost Master^^Protect Volcor until you reach the road, then speak to Terenthis in Auberdine.^All right, <name>, force it is. Let's get out of here as soon as you're ready. We'll fight our way down to the road--Grimclaw should still be there. Once there, we can part ways. Terenthis will want to hear your version of the story immediately, so head to Auberdine after we make it out of here.Escape Through Stealth^20^All^Darkshore^Volcor^Terenthis^^A Lost Master^^Escape the Furbolg cave and meet Terenthis in Auberdine.^All right then... if you're sure, we'll sneak out of here. Let us leave when you're ready. Remember, after you've escaped, meet Terenthis back in Auberdine. I'll head there on my own since I'll probably be moving faster than you.Denalan's Earth^5^All^Teldrassil^Syral Bladeleaf^Denalan^^^Timberling Seeds, Timberling Sprouts^Bring the package of Rare Earth to Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.^Are you heading to the south? To Lake Al'Ameth? If so, then I have a task I might ask of you... My colleague Denalan has a camp along the eastern end of the lake, where he is studying and experimenting on the plant life of Teldrassil. He requested a package of rare earths from Darnassus and it was late, only recently arriving here in Dolanaar. Can you take the package to him?The New Frontier^55^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Bluff Runner Windstrider^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^The New Frontier^^^Speak with Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem on the Elder Rise of Thunder Bluff about the Cenarion Circle's call to explore the frontiers of Kalimdor.^Attention, heroes!

"Wizbang here! The next Buzzbox is north of Auberdine, on the beach So, that Buzzbox is number 411 and it needs 3 Thresher Eyes for its repairs. They're just off the coast! The darkshore threshers... *Hic*... Sorry about that... Just like last time, when you give the Buzzbox the goods, it'll spit out your reward. *Hic*... What? No, I'm fine!"Buzzbox 323^14^All^Darkshore^Buzzbox 411^Buzzbox 323^Buzzbox 827^^^Collect 6 Moonstalker Fangs and place them in Buzzbox 323.^The Buzzbox gives a burst of static as you hear Wizbang begin to speak. "The next Buzzbox is number 323. Ish north of Auberdine but... where's the ale? Wha? Oh, ish on the road sho ya shouldn't have trouble finding it near the bridge." Wizbang mumbles something incoherent before you hear a loud gulping sound. "Thish one needs Moonstalker Fangs... 6 of 'em."Buzzbox 525^16^All^Darkshore^Buzzbox 323^Buzzbox 525^Buzzbox 827^^^Collect 4 Grizzled Scalps from Grizzled Thistle Bears to the south of Auberdine and place them in Buzzbox 525.^Over the boiling noises and dripping sounds coming from the machine, you hear Wizbang's wavering voice call out. "Nexsht onesh far south down the road. Shouldn't be hard to find... jusht off to the shide... near a fensh. I think I hid it in shum bushesh... Bushessh. Hehehe... Yesh, Buzzbox 525 takes grizzled scalps from thoshe grizzled thistle bears. Boy thash a mouthful. Grizzshled... Hehehe..." You hear more gulping sounds as the machine cuts out.

"4!"The New Frontier^55^Horde^Undercity^Harbinger Balthazad^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^The New Frontier^^^Speak with Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem on the Elder Rise of Thunder Bluff about the Cenarion Circle's call to explore the frontiers of Kalimdor.^Attention, heroes!

I was on my small vessel, skimming over the submerged ruins of Zoram, when naga attacked me, surging from the water and tearing at me with their claws! I fled, carrying what supplies I could to make this meager camp. But when I reached the shore and ran... my prized possession was lost. Please, <name>, find the site of my ambush, along the coast to the north, and search for an ancient statuette. It is the reason I have braved the dangers of the Zoram Strand.The Zoram Strand^19^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shindrell Swiftfire^Shindrell Swiftfire^^^Pridewings of Stonetalon^Bring 20 Wrathtail Heads to Shindrell Swiftfire in Astranaar.^There is evil lurking on our northwestern coast, known as the Zoram Strand. It is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, destroyed during the Sundering and submerged beneath the seas. It has been lost to the night elves for ages. Lost, and nearly forgotten. Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know. But reason matters little; we must slay these fiends and throw them back to the depths! Return to me when your mission is complete.Ruuzel^25^Alliance^Ashenvale^Talen^Talen^^The Ancient Statuette^^Bring the Ring of Zoram to Talen near the Zoram Strand.^I fear the ancient statuette's secrets will remain forever hidden unless you find the key to its ancient lock. That key is a ring, the Ring of Zoram. It belonged to the rulers of this city before the waves of the Sundering drowned it. For years the ring was lost, but the naga have recently found it. Their leader, Ruuzel, dwells on an isle on the northern edge of Zoram. Please, <name>, retrieve the ring for me!Bathran's Hair^20^Alliance^Ashenvale^Orendil Broadleaf^Orendil Broadleaf^^^Orendil's Cure^Bring 5 Bathran's Hair to Orendil Broadleaf in Ashenvale.^There is a plant that once grew in the old ruins of Bathran's Haunt to the north. The plant was called Bathran's Hair and was known to cure ailments of the spirit. There is a sick child in the village, and I believe it is more than just a physical illness. Will you go to Bathran's Haunt and search it for Bathran's Hair? I may need it to properly treat the child. Bathran's Haunt lies north of Maestra's Post and just south of the border to Darkshore.Forsaken Diseases^29^Alliance^Ashenvale^Kayneth Stillwind^Kayneth Stillwind^^Kayneth Stillwind^Insane Druids^Bring a Bottle of Disease to Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song.^The Forsaken, the undead arm of the Horde, have crept into Ashenvale, lurking at our ruins and our barrows. We believe their goal is to spread disease amongst the lands of the night elves. We must confirm this! The Forsaken have a camp south of here, near the Dor'Danil Barrow Den, where they create poisons and diseases and place them in bottles. Fight your way into that camp and steal a bottle of disease. Return with such a bottle. I will test it and find its purpose.Insane Druids^32^Alliance^Ashenvale^Kayneth Stillwind^Kayneth Stillwind^^Forsaken Diseases^^Kill the druids: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, Mavoris Cloudsbreak; then return to Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song.^When I struggled with the Forsaken's poisons, I had a vision. I had a vision of the druids in the Dor'danil Barrow Den, poisoned... murdered by the undead! They are now errant ghosts, severed from their bodies and driven mad. So that the druids' spirits might some day find peace, you must enter the Dor'danil Barrow Den and destroy its once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall and Mavoris Cloudsbreak. Do this, then return to me.The Book of Ur^26^Horde^Shadowfang Keep^Keeper Bel'dugur^Keeper Bel'dugur^^^^Bring the Book of Ur to Keeper Bel'dugur at the Apothecarium in the Undercity.^<name>, Shadowfang Keep holds a book, the Book of Ur, which would be much prized in my collection. Ur was a great mage of Dalaran before the coming of the Scourge, his studies in other worlds are of much value to ... certain parties among the Forsaken. Enter Shadowfang Keep and find the book. Bring it to me, and I will report your service to our Dark Lady...Arugal Must Die^27^All^Shadowfang Keep^Dalar Dawnweaver^Dalar Dawnweaver^^^^Kill Arugal and bring his head to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.^Arugal still resides in Shadowfang Keep. We cannot claim Silverpine as a strategic stronghold for the Dark Lady until Arugal is slain. I shall see to it that his magic is eradicated, <name>. But I leave it in your hands to see that Arugal meets the death he so deserves. Travel to Shadowfang Keep and put an end to Arugal's foul spells once and for all. Bring to me the vile wizard's head!The New Frontier^55^Alliance^Stormwind City^Crier Goodman^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^The New Frontier^^^Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm at the Cenarion Enclave of Darnassus about the Cenarion Circle's call to explore the frontiers of Kalimdor.^Attention, heroes!

Afterwards, bring the Divined Scroll to Sentinel Velene Starstrike at the Silverwind Refuge.^Take this divining scroll--it can determine the creator of these elementals. But you will need something from them to use as a reagent to focus scroll's magic--their bracers should do nicely. A few intact bracers from the creatures should be enough. The other bracers will be useless for our purposes, but they may be worth something to a merchant if you wish to sell them. Once you have the intact bracers attempt to use the scroll. Return to me with the results and we shall proceed from there.Mage Summoner^25^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Velene Starstrike^Sentinel Velene Starstrike^Elemental Bracers^^^Slay Sarilus Foulborne and bring his head to Sentinel Velene Starstrike in Silverwind Refuge.^There's only one undead mage in the Barrens capable of defiling this many water elementals. He's also the only one foolish enough to try. Sarilus Foulborne is probably sitting at the top of Dreadmist Peak, laughing at me. <name>, you must go into enemy territory and destroy this miscreant. I have had enough of his idiocy and we must show him what happens to those who annoy the Sentinels. Destroy him and bring me his head. Be wary though, the Horde may be watching for you.The New Frontier^55^Horde^Orgrimmar^Warcaller Gorlach^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^The New Frontier^^^Speak with Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem on the Elder Rise of Thunder Bluff about the Cenarion Circle's call to explore the frontiers of Kalimdor.^Attention, heroes!

Take it to Astranaar and give it to the child's parent, Pelturas Whitemoon. To reach Astranaar, follow the road south, then east.Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger!^32^Alliance^Ashenvale^Illiyana^Anilia^Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger!^^^Find Anilia in Xavian in Ashenvale.^Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the Branch of Cenarius from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days! <name>, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northwest. I don't know what to think. Look for Anilia, she was leading them on the search.The Howling Vale^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow^Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow^The Howling Vale^^^Go to the Howling Vale and study the Tome of Mel'Thandris, then return to Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow at Forest Song.^Though we have put many resources and much effort into driving the remaining demons from the Felwood to the north, our successes have been few. We have been able to keep much of the demonic presence from Ashenvale. To the north, near the Felwood border, the ruined shrine of Mel'Thandris has been overtaken by mysterious wolf-men. Their chilling calls have led the area to be known as the Howling Vale. The Tome of Mel'Thandris kept at the shrine may shed some light on why these wolf-men have come.Raene's Cleansing^21^Alliance^Ashenvale^Teronis' Corpse^Raene Wolfrunner^Raene's Cleansing^^Raene's Cleansing, An Aggressive Defense^Find the Glowing Gem and return to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar with Teronis' Journal.^As you rummage through Teronis' belongings, you find a journal that is still in good condition. You take the journal and leave Teronis' corpse as is. The only thing left to do is find the gem Teronis was seeking. Raene mentioned it being in the area. Perhaps the murlocs have it...Raene's Cleansing^21^Alliance^Ashenvale^Raene Wolfrunner^Shael'dryn^Raene's Cleansing^Raene's Cleansing^^Find Shael'dryn at the moonwell to the northeast.^You'll have to do the research yourself, but from what notes Teronis has made, it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of the rod Dartol created. I would start by heading to the moonwell east of Iris Lake. When you're ready, follow the road and turn north when you reach a small sitting area on your left. A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out. Keep the gem with you--Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod.An Aggressive Defense^24^Alliance^Ashenvale^Raene Wolfrunner^Raene Wolfrunner^^Raene's Cleansing^^Kill 1 Den Watcher, 2 Ursas, 10 Totemics, and 12 Warriors of the Foulweald tribe, and then return to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar.^Before you travel to the moonwell I have another task that will aid the people of Ashenvale if you would like to test your skills. Along the road heading east before the Falfarren River, furbolgs have been attacking travelers. Their tortured minds feeding upon fear, and their appetites satiated by the blood of innocents. Aid the Sentinels in protecting the lands by showing those monsters the same mercy they have shown our kind. I believe their camps are south of the road... be careful.Raene's Cleansing^27^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shael'dryn^Shael'dryn^Raene's Cleansing^^^Find the Wooden Key and a piece of Dartol's Rod before returning to Shael'dryn at the moonwell.^I wish your tidings were better. Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted. If your goal is to find the next piece of the rod, then you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in. The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here, near Felwood. Once you have it, look for a small glade west of the road near the Felwood border... the chest should be hidden around there.Raene's Cleansing^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shael'dryn^Shael'dryn^Raene's Cleansing^^^Find the final piece of Dartol's Rod and return to Shael'dryn at the moonwell.^The final piece of the rod was given to the druids of Dor'danil for safekeeping. I have no idea where they hid it. I'm sorry I can't help you more than that. All I can tell you is to follow the road that leads towards the Barrens. The druids took shelter to the east of that road, but they won't be of much help to you: they were killed recently... it's something I don't like to think about much. When you find the final piece, bring it to me and I will help you reconstruct the rod.Raene's Cleansing^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shael'dryn^Hidden Shrine^Raene's Cleansing^^^Find the hidden shrine and re-enchant Dartol's Rod.^Here is the completed rod, <name>. Reconstructing it was simple... it's finding the shrine that has the power to recharge it that will be the hard part. With some focus and effort it shouldn't be too hard for someone like you, who's already accomplished so much. Head southeast of here--there are very few paths, so be careful--and keep your eyes to the north. The shrine is hidden within the mountains that surround this glade. Once there, place the rod within the shrine... the rest is magic. Hehe.Raene's Cleansing^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shael'dryn^Raene Wolfrunner^Raene's Cleansing^^^Return to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar.^I suggest you find Raene and let her know the rod is finished. I'm sure she'll know what your next course should be. Good luck, <name>.Raene's Cleansing^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Raene Wolfrunner^Krolg^Raene's Cleansing^^^Find an uncorrupted furbolg, and using the power of Dartol's Rod of Transformation, speak to him.^Alas, I'm not completely certain what he had in mind next. If what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether. Which form, I do not know. Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to the tainted furbolgs, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was safe from the effects of Fel Moss. I would start your search southeast of Mystral Lake.The Branch of Cenarius^32^Alliance^Ashenvale^Anilia^Illiyana^Vile Satyr! Dryads in Danger!^^Satyr Slaying!^Kill Geltharis and return the Branch of Cenarius to Illiyana at Forest Song.^Anilia puts her hands on your shoulders and draws you close. Gasping, she points towards the arch to the north, before her eyes close and her last wheezing breath leaves her body. "He has taken it... Geltharis..." You know in your heart that Anilia's dying wish is to see the Branch of Cenarius back in dryad hands.Satyr Slaying!^32^Alliance^Ashenvale^Illiyana^Illiyana^^The Branch of Cenarius^^Bring 16 Satyr Horns to Illiyana in Forest Song.^I can't believe that Anilia is gone... We used to play together in the forests all the time. I almost feel... sad. I know something that might make me feel better. Please, slay the satyrs that took Anilia from me! Bring me their horns as proof of your actions and you will forever have my gratitude. Elune's Tear^22^Alliance^Ashenvale^Pelturas Whitemoon^Pelturas Whitemoon^^Orendil's Cure^The Ruins of Stardust^Bring Elune's Tear to Pelturas in Astranaar.^I had hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through my child. We must find more powerful medicine! Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies to try should his first one fail. Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the isle on Iris Lake, east of Astranaar. Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption... please, <name>, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness!The Ruins of Stardust^23^Alliance^Ashenvale^Pelturas Whitemoon^Pelturas Whitemoon^^Elune's Tear^Fallen Sky Lake^Bring 5 Handfuls of Stardust to Pelturas in Astranaar.^Elune's Tear washed clear some of my daughter's sickness. Her nightmares are lessened and I thank the goddess for her blessing. But ... fever still rages within her. Orendil told me of a frosted dust found among the Ruins of Stardust. Perhaps it will abate Relara's fever. Gather some of the dust, then please return to me. The Ruins of Stardust lie to the south, <name>. May Elune speed your journey.Fallen Sky Lake^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Pelturas Whitemoon^Pelturas Whitemoon^^The Ruins of Stardust^^Retrieve a Fallen Moonstone from the Shadethicket Oracle, then bring it to Pelturas in Astranaar.^Relara's fever has passed, but she is still very weak. I do not believe time alone will give her back the strength she has lost. I believe it will take the power of a moonstone. We used to gather moonstones at Fallen Sky Lake to the southeast... until the Shadethickets came. Their leader, a Shadethicket Oracle, gathered up all the fallen moonstones and hoards them. Now, you must retrieve a moonstone from the Oracle. And to do that, I fear that you must slay him.Avast Ye, Scallywag^60^All^Stranglethorn Vale^"Pretty Boy" Duncan^Fleet Master Firallon^Avast Ye, Scallywag^^^Speak with Fleet Master Firallon aboard the Crimson Vale off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.^<name>... yeah, I've heard of you. I've heard that you're no friend of Booty Bay - just like us Bloodsail Buccaneers. Fleet Master Firallon is looking for hale and hearty <men /women> just like you for a special mission. If you're interested, head on out to the Crimson Veil and speak with him below decks. She's anchored off the Wild Coast east of here, next to the Riptide and the Damsel's Luck.Velinde Starsong^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Melyria Frostshadow^Thyn'tel Bladeweaver^The Howling Vale^^^Speak with Thyn'tel Bladeweaver at the Warrior's Terrace in Darnassus.^Velinde Starsong was my predecessor here in Ashenvale Forest. At first it seemed she had the situation in Felwood under control, but little by little her efforts faltered. One day, she simply disappeared. I was sent here to continue her work. I'm afraid I know nothing of the priestess, however. Perhaps Thyn'tel Bladeweaver, one of the commanders of the Sentinels, knows further details of her disappearance that I was not a party to. Surely she will understand the import of such information.Velinde's Effects^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Thyn'tel Bladeweaver^Thyn'tel Bladeweaver^The Howling Vale^^^Search through Velinde's chest for her journal, then return it along with the key to Thyn'tel Bladeweaver in Darnassus.^The Tome of Mel'Thandris showed you this? I suppose there would be little harm in allowing you to examine her belongings. This key will allow you to open the chest where we stored her things in the Sentinels' bunkhouse. She kept a journal of her duties, if there is anything to be learned, it will be from that. I should tell you, the Sentinels believe that she had her own reasons for leaving, and expect that she could return at any time. The priestess has done much in the past to earn our trust.The Barrens Port^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Thyn'tel Bladeweaver^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^The Howling Vale^^^Speak with Wharfmaster Dizzywig at Ratchet in the Barrens.^Ratchet is the only port in the Barrens. Most likely Velinde found a trading vessel in Ratchet to take her to Blackwater Cove in Azeroth. We've had limited dealings with the goblins that run the port, but the master of the dock should have information about the comings and goings of ship passengers. Follow the road southeast through Ashenvale and you will find yourself in the Barrens. Watch your step, <name>, warriors of the Horde patrol the land. You will be safe at the port, though.Passage to Booty Bay^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^Caravaneer Ruzzgot^The Howling Vale^^^Take a boat to Booty Bay and speak with Caravaneer Ruzzgot.^Ah yes, finally found it. Should have told me she passed through here that long ago. Let's see. Velinde. Booked passage to Booty Bay on the Black Osprey. I don't have anything here saying otherwise, so I'd assume it arrived in port safely. Not much more help I can be to you, but she asked about overland travel over on that side of the world, and I mentioned Ruzzgot, a caravan driver based out of Booty Bay. Might be that this Velinde traveled with him. Move along, now. I haven't all day for you.The Caravan Road^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Caravaneer Ruzzgot^Clerk Daltry^The Howling Vale^^^Speak with Clerk Daltry in Darkshire.^Turns out I was wrong about you, and that isn't something that happens everyday. It just so happens that I remember this Velinde you're looking for. Isn't every day that a night elf priestess that wants to travel with a dirty old--but great for your shipping needs!--caravan like my own. We split up on the way north, she was headed for Darkshire. The clerk there keeps all sorts of records. Might know something useful. Be careful in the jungle, it is a deadly place even at the best of times.The Carevin Family^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Clerk Daltry^Jonathan Carevin^The Howling Vale^^^Speak with Jonathan Carevin in Darkshire.^No, I don't have any records of a Velinde Starsong staying in Darkshire... though, if you don't mind me saying, I can hardly imagine a night elf priestess taking a room in the inn, if you get my meaning? These wolf-men you mentioned though, that's something I've heard about. Just the other day, Calor came into town with a string of their heads. He works with the Carevin family. Hunters of demons, undead, and other monstrosities. Speak with Jonathan, he's the head of the household.The Scythe of Elune^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Jonathan Carevin^Jonathan Carevin^The Howling Vale^^^Look for signs of the Scythe of Elune then return to Jonathan Carevin in Darkshire.^Your story rings true... I do not entirely understand your motives, but if your business here in Duskwood involves ridding the forest of worgen in any number, then I can forgo understanding for results. There is a mine to the south that has been overrun with worgen... They appeared out of nowhere, but from what we know, that is where they first were found. Go about your business, but I would ask that if you find anything of import, you share it with me. We will accept any aid in our war against evil.Answered Questions^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Jonathan Carevin^Thyn'tel Bladeweaver^The Howling Vale^^^Return to Thyn'tel Bladeweaver in Darnassus.^We shall rein in the worgen problem, have no worry of that. This evil that your friend introduced to our woods will be contained, and I bear her no ill will for her actions. Strange events are afoot in these times, <name>, and the darkness knows no respite. I will keep you no longer. I suspect that there are others that should hear of what you have found in the mines of Duskwood.Raene's Cleansing^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Krolg^Krolg^Raene's Cleansing^^^Kill Ran Bloodtooth, 4 Bloodtooth Guards and collect Ran Bloodtooth's Skull. Return to Krolg near Lake Mystral should you succeed.^The night elves are as old as time, but their arrogance destroys their very world. And now it destroys our lives too. But that can no longer be controlled... I blame the elves for much, but we are still responsible for our actions. Even beyond the corruption, we are capable of great evil. Ran Bloodtooth is one such evil. Power hungry, lusting... the corruption has only made him stronger. My hatred for the elves burns, but I do not wish ill upon their children, so we must police our own.Raene's Cleansing^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Krolg^Raene Wolfrunner^Raene's Cleansing^^^Bring Ran Bloodtooth's Skull to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar.^Return to your own tribe and let them know of your victory here. Show them your trophy, and bask in the glory...The New Frontier^55^Alliance^Darnassus^Herald Moonstalker^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^The New Frontier^^^Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm at the Cenarion Enclave of Darnassus about the Cenarion Circle's call to explore the frontiers of Kalimdor.^Attention, heroes! The Cenarion Circle seeks able bodied individuals to assist them in exploring the vast new frontiers of Kalimdor! A forbidden wasteland of unimaginable dangers lies far to the west of Tanaris and Gadgetzan, and the Circle needs willing and honorable proxies to act in their stead. All interested individuals should seek audience with the Cenarion Circle. Speak with the Arch Druid in Darnassus, Fandral Staghelm, for more information!Compendium of the Fallen^38^Orc, Tauren,^Scarlet Monastery^Sage Truthseeker^Sage Truthseeker^^^^Retrieve the Compendium of the Fallen from the Monastery in Tirisfal Glades and return to Sage Truthseeker in Thunder Bluff.^The Earthen Ring had pure intentions towards our plagued brethren. But who is to know the motivations of those whispering in the ears of the Elder Council? The Forsaken whom we have allied with have a history wrought with deceit. Too hasty was our pact. Perhaps Cairne would have been wise to heed the warnings from Orgrimmar. Deep within the Scarlet Monastery lies the Compendium of the Fallen, guarded by crazed human zealots. Their method is forged from insanity but their research might prove useful.Mythology of the Titans^38^Alliance^Scarlet Monastery^Librarian Mae Paledust^Librarian Mae Paledust^^^^Retrieve Mythology of the Titans from the Monastery and bring it to Librarian Mae Paledust in Ironforge.^The future is inevitable! We hurl ourselves towards it like falling raindrops to the Great Sea. But perhaps, by studying the past, we can know what to expect and be better prepared for the unknown. Before dire troubles fell upon Lordaeron, there was a bastion of knowledge tucked away in the Tirisfal Glades. It is rumored that a book called Mythology of the Titans was housed in the library of the old Monastery. Bring it to me and perhaps together we can unlock the secrets of the past!Vorrel's Revenge^33^Horde^Scarlet Monastery^Vorrel Sengutz^Monika Sengutz^^^^Return Vorrel Sengutz's wedding ring to Monika Sengutz in Tarren Mill.^Even though my will is free, I can serve the Dark Lady no more. I feel my time on Azeroth has come to an end. My life force is shattered. Interrogator Vishas did this to me! Tortured me for weeks! Took my wedding ring and gave it to his wife. The monster! Revenge... I want revenge! The pompous fool bragged about his precious wife, Nancy, who lived along Lake Lordamere. Track the wench down, slay her and return my wedding ring to my wife, Monika in Tarren Mill. Heed my last wishes....Down the Scarlet Path^40^Alliance^Desolace^Brother Anton^Raleigh the Devout^Brother Anton^^In the Name of the Light^Take Brother Anton's Letter of Commendation to Raleigh the Devout in Southshore.^We of the Scarlet Crusade lay claim to strongholds from Hearthglen to Tirisfal Glades. We are quite proud of our bastions of cleansing throughout Lordaeron. You have proven yourself against the undead in Desolace. But the true threat of the plague lies in Lordaeron. Travel to the town of Southshore, in the Eastern Kingdoms. Seek out a crusader named Raleigh the Devout. Give him this letter of commendation bearing my seal and he will escort you to a place of honor in our Scarlet Monastery.In the Name of the Light^40^Alliance^Scarlet Monastery^Raleigh the Devout^Raleigh the Devout^^Down the Scarlet Path^^Kill High Inquisitor Whitemane, Scarlet Commander Mograine, Herod, the Scarlet Champion and Houndmaster Loksey and then report back to Raleigh the Devout in Southshore.^I once served the Scarlet Crusade with honor, loyalty and pride. I believed their cause to be a noble one: to rid Azeroth of the undead. But as I spent time at the Monastery in Tirisfal Glades I realized that their grasp on reality was slipping. They now think everyone is plagued who doesn't wear the tabard of the Crusade. Innocent men and women were tortured because they were supposedly plagued. The Scarlet Crusade must be crushed in the name of the Light. You, <name>, must destroy the deranged regime.Culling the Threat^25^Alliance^Ashenvale^Raene Wolfrunner^Raene Wolfrunner^^^^Bring Dal Bloodclaw's Skull to Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar.^Directly to the north of Astranaar are the Thistlefur furbolg. My scouts report that their numbers have grown greatly over the past few months. If they grow too great, they may find the courage to attack Astranaar directly. Kill as many of their kind as you can, but bring me their chieftain's skull as proof that their efforts have been stifled... for now. I shall remain here in Astranaar and await word from you. Elune be with you.Raene's Cleansing^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Hidden Shrine^Shael'dryn^Raene's Cleansing^^^Return to Shael'dryn at the moonwell.^The rod, now complete, lies in your hands. Shael'dryn will want to hear of your success.Journey to Stonetalon Peak^18^Alliance^Ashenvale^Faldreas Goeth'Shael^Keeper Albagorm^^^^Travel to Keeper Albagorm on Stonetalon Peak.^The forest spirits tell me you are brave and willing to travel. To the south, not far from Mystral Lake, there lies a tunnel named The Talondeep Path. Through this tunnel you will come to an area known as Windshear Crag in the Stonetalon Mountains. Once there, journey to the southwest past Cragpool Lake and then north, up the steep slope until you reach Stonetalon Peak. There awaits Keeper Albagorm. Heed his bidding, <race>. The journey will be perilous.Reclaiming the Charred Vale^27^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Keeper Albagorm^Keeper Albagorm^Reclaiming the Charred Vale^^^Keeper Albagorm on Stonetalon Peak wants you to slay 7 Bloodfury Harpies, 7 Bloodfury Ambushers, 7 Bloodfury Slayers and 7 Bloodfury Roguefeathers.^As a protector of the forest spirits you can undoubtedly guess why I am alarmed. You have traveled through these mountains to reach this peak. Surely you have seen the travesty which has befallen the land. Greed has led to the destruction of these sacred hills. The Charred Vale to the south was set afire by the greedy mechanized army of industrialists. Worse yet, the Bloodfuries that have encroached on the land refuse us passage in to begin regrowth. Drive the wretched harpies out, <name>!Jin'Zil's Forest Magic^26^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Witch Doctor Jin'Zil^Witch Doctor Jin'Zil^^^^Witch Doctor Jin'Zil at Malaka'jin wants 5 portions of Stonetalon Sap, 5 Twilight Whiskers, 30 Courser Eyes and a Fey Dragon Scale.^So excited I am! Three little cages for three little elves! But what shall we do with our lovely tree-hugging friends? Why, let's give them a taste of... what do they call it... forest magic! I'll need a good mess of Stonetalon sap. From those horrid felines, bring me some twilight whiskers. This calls for plenty of courser eyes, of course -- can never have enough eyes. Oh, and lest we forget, a precious scale from a fey dragon. Hurry to Stonetalon Peak, <name>, so I can brew some forest magic!Reclaiming the Charred Vale^27^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Keeper Albagorm^Falfindel Waywarder^Reclaiming the Charred Vale^^^Travel to Falfindel Waywarder on the border of Thousand Needles and Feralas.^The Bloodfuries have been subdued. But they will regroup soon enough if action is not taken. Far south of the Barrens lies a land known as Thousand Needles. If you travel west in Thousand Needles until you reach the lush forest's edge of Feralas, you will find a druid named Falfindel Waywarder. This great and wise druid is capable of calling forth great forest spirits which can aid in the reclamation of the Charred Vale. Send word of our need! Seek him out at once!Letter to Jin'Zil^20^Horde^The Barrens^Darsok Swiftdagger^Witch Doctor Jin'Zil^^Serena Bloodfeather^^Deliver Darsok's letter to Jin'Zil within his cave in Malaka'Jin, in Stonetalon.^You've done so well for me, <name>. You're a regular lucky rabbit's foot and there's something I want you to see. The harpies are not from around the Barrens. They come from a place called Stonetalon, far to the northwest of here. Though it is probably a dangerous place for you, I need this letter delivered to an old friend of mine who lives there, a witch doctor by the name of Jin'Zil. He'll be happy to know that Serena Bloodfeather is dead, and I think you'll find Stonetalon an interesting place.The Spirits of Stonetalon^17^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Zor Lonetree^Seereth Stonebreak^The Spirits of Stonetalon^^^Speak with Seereth Stonebreak at the border of the Stonetalon Mountains and the Barrens.^The spirits of the Stonetalon Mountains are angered, for goblins and their servants are plundering and burning the land. So the land has cried out, and those who listen for such things... have heard. Seereth Stonebreak, a promising shaman of the Horde, was sent to Stonetalon. She reports massive deforestation at the hands of the goblins, and requests aid. Meet Seereth in Stonetalon. To reach her, follow the road west of the Barrens' Crossroads. She is camped near the Greatwood Vale.Goblin Invaders^19^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Seereth Stonebreak^Seereth Stonebreak^The Spirits of Stonetalon^^The Elder Crone, Shredding Machines^Kill 15 Venture Co. Loggers, then return to Seereth Stonebreak on the border of Stonetalon and the Barrens.^The goblin-run Venture Company moved into the Stonetalon Mountains, chopping down trees and burning huge stretches of forest. The spirits of this place are nearly blind with pain and rage. We must stop the Venture Company! Head northwest, beyond the Greatwood Vale and into the Windshear Crag. You will find the goblins and their servants at work--show them the Horde will not allow the exploitation of Stonetalon. Show them in the language they best understand... Violence.The Elder Crone^18^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Seereth Stonebreak^Magatha Grimtotem^^Goblin Invaders^Forsaken Aid^Speak with Magatha in Thunder Bluff.^To truly tend the spirits of Stonetalon we must consult the tauren elders. I do not know many of their leaders' names, but I do know of one: Magatha. I have heard that she is very old, and she knows much. If anyone can marshal spiritual aid from the tauren, it is she. Magatha resides in the tauren capital of Thunder Bluff, on Elder Rise -- the city's northeastern bluff. Speak with Magatha, and tell her of the peril of Stonetalon Mountains.Forsaken Aid^18^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Magatha Grimtotem^Apothecary Zamah^Forsaken Aid^The Elder Crone^^Speak with Apothecary Zamah in the Pools of Vision in Thunder Bluff.^The tauren have a bond with the land, and it pains me to hear of Stonetalon's plight. But I fear that to heal the land, we must first remove the disease upon it. Is it not fortunate, then, that the Forsaken are allied with us? They know much of disease. I believe they can aid us, and by doing so they will strengthen the trust between our people. Speak with Apothecary Zamah. She is a scholar and an emissary of the Forsaken. You will find her in the Pools of Vision below the Spirit Rise.Journey to Tarren Mill^18^All^Thunder Bluff^Apothecary Zamah^Apothecary Lydon^Forsaken Aid^^^Bring Zamah's Note to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^To rid Stonetalon of the Venture Company, we must take extreme measures. Extreme, but without bloodshed. A colleague of mine may have just the tool we need. His name is Lydon; he dwells in the town of Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills, in the distant land of Lordaeron. To reach Hillsbrad, travel by zeppelin to our capital, the Undercity. Then go north to Tirisfal Glades, southwest to Silverpine, and south to Hillsbrad. Seek Lydon and bring him this note. It details our needs to him.Blood of Innocents^23^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Lydon^Forsaken Aid^^Return to Thunder Bluff^Bring 5 Vials of Innocent Blood to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^I will create a toxin to bleed the violence from the Venture Company, rendering them weak and docile. That should fix the Horde's problem in Stonetalon, yes? But to create the toxin, I will need the blood of innocents, a difficult ingredient to obtain. Fortunately the Syndicate, a group of human brigands in this area, employ shadow mages... and those mages collect innocent blood for their own, unsavory purposes. You can find the Syndicate shadow mages in Durnholde Keep to the southeast.Return to Thunder Bluff^23^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Zamah^^Blood of Innocents^The Flying Machine Airport^Bring Lydon's Toxin to Apothecary Zamah in Thunder Bluff.^Here is the toxin. If you use it against the Venture Company it should produce favorable, perhaps even contagious, results. I must say, it is quite exciting to see my work applied in the field! But before using it, take it to Apothecary Zamah. She must create a delivery method for the toxin to maximize its effect.Shredding Machines^23^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Seereth Stonebreak^Seereth Stonebreak^^Goblin Invaders^^Kill the shredders XT:4 and XT:9, then return to Seereth Stonebreak at the border of the Stonetalon Mountains and the Barrens.^There is a relation to the spiritual magic of shaman and the natural magic of druids. This is why we shaman can hear the plea of the spirits of Stonetalon. Many of their whisperings are lost to me, but one message, one vision, is clear... I saw a vision of two man-shaped machines in Windshear Crag, northwest of Greatwood Vale, felling trees with impossible speed. These metal beasts must be stopped! In my vision, the machines were marked with strange symbols: XT:4 and XT:9.Deepmoss Spider Eggs^20^All^The Barrens^Mebok Mizzyrix^Mebok Mizzyrix^^^^Bring 15 Deepmoss Eggs to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.^Spider egg omelettes are a new fad in Booty Bay! The problem is... Booty Bay's got no eggs. I smell an opportunity! In Windshear Crag and Sishir Canyon, in the Stonetalon Mountains to the northwest, lives the deepmoss spider. Bring me its eggs and I'll pay a bundle! In Windshear Crag, the eggs will be clustered under what trees remain. In Sishir Canyon... well, if you have a weak stomach then maybe you should just collect the eggs at Windshear Crag...On Guard in Stonetalon^21^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Thenysil^Kaela Shadowspear^On Guard in Stonetalon^^^Find Kaela Shadowspear overlooking the valley entering Windshear Crag in the Stonetalon Mountains.^Hello, <name>. You seem to be full of wanderlust by the looks of you. Have you been to the Stonetalon Mountains? It is a land plagued by the Venture Co. and other enemies of the night elves. Recently, Sentinel Wolfrunner sent my friend Kaela Shadowspear there to investigate what's happening to the land, but I have yet to hear word back from her. I'm even more concerned because the Alliance sent a gnome mage along with her... a sign of trouble for sure. Would you find her and report back to me?A Gnome's Respite^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Gaxim Rustfizzle^On Guard in Stonetalon^^An Old Colleague, A Scroll from Mauren^Kill 10 Venture Co. Loggers, and 10 Venture Co. Deforesters and return to Gaxim Rustfizzle in Stonetalon.^You see, <name>, I'm a member of the Enlightened Assembly of Arcanology, Alchemy and Engineering Sciences, and it's my goal... nay, my DUTY! to show the night elves that a blend of magic, mixtures, and mechanisms can help save their forests. But it's a hard fought war, and the goblins reproduce like rabbits it seems. I haven't even had time to build my newest inventions! I need some time to plan and organize. But to do that, I need your help keeping the goblins at bay in Windshear Crag to the east...An Old Colleague^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Lomac Gearstrip^An Old Colleague^A Gnome's Respite^^Speak to Lomac Gearstrip in Ironforge.^The device I'm thinking about is my most advanced version to date. But we'll need a special potion if it's to work. I'm thinking we might as well get the good stuff since this mission could be your last. And for that, we're going to need some potent explosives: Nitromirglyceronium. The only person who can make NG-5 is an old friend of mine: Lomac Gearstrip. Look for him in Tinker Town. You talk him into making us some NG-5, I'll get to work on placement for my devices.Ineptitude + Chemicals = Fun^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Lomac Gearstrip^Lomac Gearstrip^An Old Colleague^^^Bring 4 Minor Mana Potions and 2 Elixirs of Minor Fortitude to Lomac Gearstrip in Ironforge.^Hahaha... you need Nitromirglyceronium to stop goblins from destroying a forest?! I don't care if you know Gaxim or not... I'll give you the stuff just to see you or them explode into itty bitty pieces. There's a problem though: I'm all out. But I'll tell you what, you bring me the correct potions, and I'll make some up for you right away. The least you can do is prove you've got some skill as an alchemist before I just give you a sample of my greatest creation.Ineptitude + Chemicals = Fun^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Lomac Gearstrip^Gaxim Rustfizzle^An Old Colleague^^Covert Ops - Beta^Bring the Nitromirglyceronium back to Gaxim Rustfizzle in Stonetalon.^Here you go, stranger. Take heed with it though... it's volatile stuff. If you're really a friend of Gaxim's, then tell him I say hello. If you're not, then have fun blowin' yerself up.A Scroll from Mauren^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Collin Mauren^A Scroll from Mauren^A Gnome's Respite^^Find Collin Mauren in Stormwind.^Okay, now for the remote detonation part of my plan... oh, I haven't explained that yet, have I? Okay, so the short of it is this: with a little magic, I can make it so the explosives go off while you're not around. I'm putting together a device that'll allow you to push just one button and have the NG-5 explode when you're ready. But I need a spell from a friend in Stormwind--Collin Mauren is his name. You can find him in the mage quarter there. He's human, so he shouldn't be hard to miss.Devils in Westfall^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Collin Mauren^Collin Mauren^A Scroll from Mauren^^Special Delivery for Gaxim^Bring Dust Devil Debris to Collin Mauren in Stormwind.^Ah, I think I have it. A messaging spell... I believe that's the effect he's looking for. I'll have to create a scroll with the spell impressed upon it. To do that I'll need debris from a dust devil. While I gather the rest of the components, why don't you head to Westfall and find one of the foul creatures? They are dangerous, but I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle if you're willing to subject yourself to one of Gaxim's experiments. I'll be here when you return.Special Delivery for Gaxim^21^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Collin Mauren^Gaxim Rustfizzle^^Devils in Westfall^Covert Ops - Alpha^Bring the Scroll of Messaging to Gaxim Rustfizzle in Stonetalon.^Here you are, <name>. This should do nicely. Please give my regards to Gaxim when next you see him. I look forward to hearing about this adventure when it sees its completion. Fare well.Retrieval for Mauren^26^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Collin Mauren^Collin Mauren^^^^Bring 8 Crystalized Scales to Collin Mauren in Stormwind.^Travelers keep asking me about the Stonetalon Mountains. It seems to be a popular place for adventure--it doesn't matter if you're seeking wyvern, elementals, or you have business with the Venture Co. Within the Charred Vale, deep in Stonetalon, there used to be a species of basilisks whose scales, when ground to dust, made a wonderful reagent for some spells I've created. If those basilisks still live, I would love to have a few of their scales. Take your time, it is no rush, but I can pay well.Covert Ops - Alpha^22^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Gaxim Rustfizzle^^^Kaela's Update^Retrieve the Venture Co.'s Engineering Plans from the lumber mill in Windshear Crag.^This is it, <name>. Pay close attention. The devices are done, and ready to be used. Take these pages--they'll explain more about the detonators and explosives, and where you should place them. Remember, the success of your mission doesn't depend on how much destruction you cause. Plan Alpha's success depends on you bringing back the Venture Co.'s engineering plans from inside the lumber mill south of Cragpool Lake.Covert Ops - Beta^22^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Gaxim Rustfizzle^^^Kaela's Update^Retrieve the Venture Co. Letters from Windshear Mine at the east end of Windshear Crag.^Plan Beta's just like Plan Alpha, <name>. We cause a distraction and then steal their precious letters. The key is to get their letters... remember that. The pages I gave you already will tell you where to plant the explosives. Just get back here alive and with those letters....Reception from Tyrande^28^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Sentinel Thenysil^Tyrande Whisperwind^Update for Sentinel Thenysil^^^Find Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus.^<name>, I am sure Tyrande Whisperwind herself would like to thank you for taking part in this mission. It may not appear so on the surface, but what you've helped start could very well strengthen our foothold in the Stonetalon Mountains. If you consider yourself our ally against these atrocities, go see Tyrande in the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus.Update for Sentinel Thenysil^22^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Kaela Shadowspear^Sentinel Thenysil^Update for Sentinel Thenysil^Enraged Spirits, Wounded Ancients^^Return to Sentinel Thenysil in Ashenvale.^<name>, you have done a great deed by lending a hand here. The Sentinels of Ashenvale will reward you well if you informed them that Gaxim and I are alive. Tell them we are well on our way to stopping the Venture Co. and healing the lands. Find Tara Thenysil in Astranaar; she will be pleased to see you've returned with good news.Enraged Spirits^26^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Kaela Shadowspear^Kaela Shadowspear^^Kaela's Update^Update for Sentinel Thenysil^Bring 8 Smoldering Embers from any of the fire elementals in the Charred Vale to Kaela Shadowspear in Stonetalon.^I'm unsure what the Venture Co. did to the Vale, but it's obvious they were overpowered by the creatures there. They set the forest aflame, and used their inventions of destruction to decimate as much of the Vale as possible. But in their ignorance they also released something else: burning spirits, elementals of flame, stone and rage. The land has no chance to see Elune's smile while these creatures roam free. Bring me their smoldering embers to show you've reduced their numbers.Wounded Ancients^28^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Kaela Shadowspear^Kaela Shadowspear^^Kaela's Update^Update for Sentinel Thenysil^Bring a piece of Corroded Shrapnel to Kaela Shadowspear in Stonetalon.^It seems obvious to me that the protectors of the Vale--the treants--had something to do with the Venture Co. being driven back. Unfortunately, even those once great guardians have now become corrupt. Gaxim thinks their corruption is somehow linked to the weapons the goblins used during their retreat. I told him I'd collect a sample from a wounded treant and allow him to study it in order to figure out if that's true. Bring me some of the shrapnel so the gnome can tell me more...On Guard in Stonetalon^21^Alliance^Ashenvale^Kaela Shadowspear^Gaxim Rustfizzle^On Guard in Stonetalon^^^Speak to Gaxim in Stonetalon Mountains.^The situation here in Stonetalon is obviously grave for a night elf and gnome to be working together. The Venture Co. has devastated these lands and I've spent most of my time putting an end to the destruction. Do not judge Gaxim prematurely; he understands the need for us to work together. If you wish to aid us, then start by speaking to Gaxim. I'm sorry I cannot send you back to Tara with good news yet. Perhaps soon.The Flying Machine Airport^23^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Apothecary Zamah^Apothecary Zamah^^Return to Thunder Bluff^^Bring the Toxic Fogger to the Venture Co. sky port, then return to Apothecary Zamah.^The toxin is ready. All that remains is its delivery. You, <name>, must make that delivery. The Venture Company must have a means of sending messages and light cargo between its headquarters and its operations in Stonetalon. It is likely a small sky port -- not big enough for a zeppelin, but perhaps for a flying machine. You must search the areas in Stonetalon under control of the Venture Company and find this sky port, if it exists. If you find it, then place the toxin there. Place it, and run.Cenarius' Legacy^25^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Braelyn Firehand^Braelyn Firehand^Cenarius' Legacy^^^Kill 4 Sons of Cenarius, 4 Daughters of Cenarius and 4 Cenarion Botanists for Braelyn Firehand near Sun Rock Retreat.^You cannot imagine the hatred I possess for this wretched land. The ilk of Cenarius and the kaldorei druids at the peak employ their pathetic powers to stifle the flow of magic, even so far south of their pathetic holdings... their beloved forests. Would that I could return to Jaedenar and exult in the flow of magic, but my master will not allow me to return until my work is done. I have no doubt you love the night elves and their allies as little as I. Aid me, and both our ends might be satisfied.Ordanus^29^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Braelyn Firehand^Braelyn Firehand^Cenarius' Legacy^^^Bring Ordanus' head to Braelyn Firehand near Sun Rock Retreat.^They thought that they could halt the flow of magic. They were mistaken. They thought that they could hide Ordanus, but I will have his head! Magic grants me true sight. Yes... there he is. A crossroads... At the top of a great tree in Ashenvale Forest. A name... Raynewood. One of the eldest sons of the forest god. They spirited him away from the peak before I could find him, but his time runs short. Bring it to me and I will share with you a mighty gift.The Den^29^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Braelyn Firehand^Talon Den Hoard^Cenarius' Legacy^^^Travel to the Den on Stonetalon Peak. Using the Gatekeeper's Key, obtain the druids' hidden items. Use these items to open the Talon Den Hoard.^The druids built the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak, where they keep many powerful items. They devised a complex scheme to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. Luckily, I managed to... extract some details from one of them. Hidden in a small lantern at the entrance of the Den, you will find the Gatekeeper's Key--with it you will be able to open caches around the Den. The items from these caches will allow you to open their hoard, located in one of the central areas.Gerenzo's Orders^22^All^Stonetalon Mountains^Piznik^Piznik^Gerenzo's Orders^^^Get the mysterious ore from Piznik after he finishes mining it.^You know, I was once the second most important person here at this site. That all changed when Gerenzo took over. Fired my boss, Ziz Fizziks, and sent me down to work in the mines. Ziz told me to stay here and gather information, though. His new boss will pay us well if we can find out what Gerenzo's plans are. Anyways, what I do know is that Gerenzo has ordered large amounts of this gold-green ore to be mined. I can get you a sample to bring to Ziz, but you'll have to watch for patrols while I get it.Kaela's Update^22^Alliance^Stonetalon Mountains^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Kaela Shadowspear^^Covert Ops - Alpha, Covert Ops - Beta^Enraged Spirits, Wounded Ancients^Bring the Venture Co. Letters to Kaela Shadowspear in Stonetalon Mountains.^<name>, take these letters to Kaela. I'm sure she'll want to know about this. Or at least the Sentinels will. Make sure you tell her how successful we were and how we couldn't have done it without a little bit of magic.Gerenzo's Orders^22^All^Stonetalon Mountains^Piznik^Ziz Fizziks^Gerenzo's Orders^^^Deliver the Unidentified Ore to Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains.^I guess I'd better think about getting out of here, also. It won't take long for word of what happened here to spread to the higher ups, and I'm sure they wouldn't take too kindly to meeting me again. I'll sneak out and meet with Ziz. Hopefully, he'll be able to find me a new job! I'll try and clean up this mess a little, but you should take the ore sample to Ziz right away. He told me that he'd set up camp somewhere on the western side of Windshear Crag. Good luck.Super Reaper 6000^21^All^Stonetalon Mountains^Ziz Fizziks^Ziz Fizziks^Ziz Fizziks^^^Get the Super Reaper 6000 Blueprints for Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains.^Terrible what the Venture Company has done here, eh? What were they thinking? Goblin company hiring a gnome! Lucky for me, Sputtervalve knows a genius when he sees one. Hired me just after I'd been kicked out! Tells me they built some enormous woodcutting machine, and Sput' wants me to steal the plans for him. Unfortunately, Gerenzo--bloody gnome--wants me dead on sight... maybe you could steal the plans for me? You should be able to find them on one of their operators.Further Instructions^21^All^Stonetalon Mountains^Ziz Fizziks^Sputtervalve^Ziz Fizziks^^^Deliver the Sealed Envelope to Sputtervalve at Ratchet in the Barrens.^This envelope has all the information I was able to snatch as they booted me out the door... Venture Company internal documents, some manuals, technical things... Oh, and of course the Super Reaper 6000 blueprints. Sputtervalve has taken up residence at Ratchet in the Barrens. Shouldn't have much trouble finding him, he's a little green fellow.Further Instructions^27^All^Stonetalon Mountains^Sputtervalve^Ziz Fizziks^Ziz Fizziks^^^Bring the new orders to Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains.^The matter of this gnome that has been hired by the Venture Company has caused a bit of a stir in Undermine. The trade princes do not approve of Razdunk's consorting with this Gerenzo. Riddlevox has asked me to take care of the problem, and I'm sure he was instructed to do so by one or more of the trade princes. Of course, the Director didn't tell me that. Let's just say I have a hunch. Whatever the case, Gerenzo must be removed, and it would be a fitting test to have Fizziks take care of him.Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle^27^All^Stonetalon Mountains^Ziz Fizziks^Ziz Fizziks^Ziz Fizziks^^^Bring Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle's Mechanical Arm to Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains.^I met Gerenzo once, but let me tell you, he's not easy on the eyes. His flesh looks like it's rotting away, and he's grafted metal and gears onto his body, replaced some of his limbs with mechanical ones. Northeast of here, far above Cragpool Lake, up near the water wheel is where Gerenzo watches over the entire site. There's no way I could fight my way up there, not to mention take on Gerenzo... But you look like you might be able to make it. If you kill him for me, I'll make it worth your while!Elmore's Task^15^Alliance^Stormwind City^Verner Osgood^Grimand Elmore^Elmore's Task^^^Speak with Grimand Elmore in Stormwind.^There's a dwarven weaponsmith in Stormwind, Grimand Elmore, who sent word that he needs help with a delivery. I believe he wants a package sent to his homeland in the north. You have a sturdy pair on you! So if you're interested in some legwork then speak with Grimand. We could use you down here, but we must also keep our ties strong with the dwarves. You can find Grimand Elmore at the weapon shop in the Dwarven District of Stormwind, in the northeast section of town.Deathstalkers in Shadowfang^25^All^Shadowfang Keep^High Executor Hadrec^Deathstalker Vincent^^^^Find the Deathstalker Adamant and Deathstalker Vincent.^In preparation for an assault on Shadowfang, two deathstalkers were sent to the keep to gather intelligence. It has been many days and they have not returned, but we must receive their report if we're to have any hope of a successful attack! So here is your task, <name>. Go to Shadowfang Keep to the south and find the Deathstalkers Adamant and Vincent. Find them, and if they require aid then give it. This mission is as dangerous as is it critical, <name>. Do not fail.Lonebrow's Journal^27^Alliance^Thousand Needles^Henrig Lonebrow's Journal^Falfindel Waywarder^Lonebrow's Journal^^^Read Henrig Lonebrow's Journal.^You slowly open the weathered journal of Henrig Lonebrow....The Crone of the Kraul^27^Alliance^Feralas^Falfindel Waywarder^Falfindel Waywarder^Lonebrow's Journal^^^Bring Razorflank's Medallion to Falfindel Waywarder in Thalanaar.^Poor Heralath! And this dwarf... Lonebrow. What a brave soul he was. We must not let their valiance go for naught. This crone... Charlga Razorflank ... must be stopped. Surely, infiltrating the Kraul will be perilous. There isn't time to send word to Darnassus. <name>, assemble a party to slay the crone. Bring me Razorflank's Medallion as proof of demise.A Vengeful Fate^27^All^Thunder Bluff^Auld Stonespire^Auld Stonespire^^^^Bring Razorflank's Heart to Auld Stonespire in Thunder Bluff.^Cairne is a noble leader for uniting our people here on Thunder Bluff. But I cannot forgive those who drove us from our ancestral lands as easily as some. My people inhabited the southern Barrens for decades. The land was holy to us. But we were driven off by numerous foes. A vengeful fate awaits the crone, Charlga Razorflank, who musters a foul army from within Razorfen Kraul. Bring me Razorflank's heart and I can die in peace, <name>.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Tiev Mordune^Tiev Mordune^^^^Bring a Water Sapta to Tiev Mordune in Silverpine Forest if you failed to speak to the Minor Manifestation of Water.^Greetin's, <brotha/sista>! Have you too come to purify the waters here and prove your understandin' to Islen? I've just defeated the corrupt water spirit meself, and I'm just 'bout to put da bracers and remaining drops o' water on the brazier. What's dat? Ahhh. Tiev understan' all too well when somethin' goes wrong. Well, Tiev can help you plenty if you be needin' to see the pure water spirit again. Bring me a water sapta from Islen as proof that you be ready, an' I'll wait to turn in me parts.Salt Flat Venom^30^All^Thousand Needles^Fizzle Brassbolts^Fizzle Brassbolts^^^Martek the Exiled^Bring 6 Salty Scorpid Venoms to Fizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats.^I have so many designs for our rocket car! So many! And I must try them all!! I'm working on a new type of fuel. One that burns really really really hot!! I haven't gotten the mixture perfect, but I think I know what I need... The scorpids who wander the Shimmering Flats have a venom with lots and lots of salt in it. It's very unique! And it's just what I need! Bring me venom and trust me -- our car will fly!!Hardened Shells^30^All^Thousand Needles^Wizzle Brassbolts^Wizzle Brassbolts^^^Encrusted Tail Fins^Bring 9 Hardened Tortoise Shells to Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats.^My brother is working on a new fuel for his rocket car. He's brilliant, he really is. So brilliant that... I think that new fuel he's designing is strong enough to eat right through the car's chassis! I want to reinforce its fuel tanks before that happens. The tortoises out on the flats have very hard shells. I want to use them to create new tanks for our rocket car. Tanks that can hold my brother's new fuel. You look responsible enough. Will you get me those shells?Martek the Exiled^35^All^Thousand Needles^Fizzle Brassbolts^Martek the Exiled^Martek the Exiled^Salt Flat Venom^^Bring Fizzle's Letter to Martek the Exiled in the Badlands.^I'm developing a new engine that'll make the car go so fast! Fast enough to fly, I know it! I just need to make pistons that can handle very very heavy stress. All my trials have failed because I can't make pistons hard enough! But there is someone who might know how. His name is Martek the Exiled. He is a great smith and knows more about metal than anyone. Take him this letter, I know he can help! But he's far far away -- in Azeroth, in the Badlands, in a camp, with a goblin! Find him!Encrusted Tail Fins^35^All^Thousand Needles^Wizzle Brassbolts^Wizzle Brassbolts^^Hardened Shells^^Bring 10 Encrusted Tail Fins to Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats.^Our rocket car is the fastest thing on the flats! So fast that ... I'm afraid friction is going to tear it apart! To prevent that I need to create a composite to coat the car's moving parts. It must be hard but not brittle, and must be resistant to salt corrosion, or time spent on the Shimmering Flats will eat it away. Have you heard of the Vile Reef, <name>? It's off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale. Saltscale murlocs live there, and their tail fins are a crucial ingredient of my composite.Indurium^39^All^Thousand Needles^Martek the Exiled^Martek the Exiled^Martek the Exiled^^News for Fizzle^Bring 10 Indurium Flakes to Martek the Exiled in the Badlands.^I'm not out here just to stay away from people. There is a wealth of metal in the Badlands, <name>, if you have the guts to get it. The metal's called indurium and as luck would have it, it is rumored to possess high resistance to heat and stress. It might work for Fizzle's car. But let's make sure. Get me samples of indurium and I'll test its properties. True indurium ore lies deep in Uldaman, but the Stonevault troggs of the Badlands sometimes have flakes of it on them. Bring me those flakes.Going, Going, Guano!^26^Horde^Undercity^Master Apothecary Faranell^Master Apothecary Faranell^Going, Going, Guano!^^^Bring 1 pile of Kraul Guano to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.^As you can see, <name>, we're up to some very.... interesting experiments at the Royal Apothecary Society. As the Master here, it is my job to oversee the most ambitious of our alchemical attempts. So much work and so little time! You look well traveled for a <class>. Perhaps you can aid me. I'm in need of a rare substance. It's foul material; it comes from a rare species of bats only found in the muck-hole known as Razorfen Kraul. Bring to me the guano from the Kraul Bats so we can begin our work...Rocket Car Parts^31^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Kravel Koalbeard^^^^Bring 30 Rocket Car Parts to Kravel Koalbeard in the Shimmering Flats.^Heh heh, with all the races they're running here, it's no surprise that a few mishaps happen along the way. If you look around the Shimmering Flats then you'll see evidence of past crashes -- scraps of rocket car parts are littered everywhere! And those parts are worth money to the gnomes and goblins. They're always looking for more contraptions to slap onto their cars. So go out and get me parts. Bring me a heap and I'll pay you well.Wharfmaster Dizzywig^36^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^^^Bring Kravel's Parts Order to Wharfmaster Dizzywig at Ratchet in the Barrens.^I make it my job to get people what they need, and the gnomes over there need a parts order filled. Their parts were shipped to Ratchet a week ago, but I haven't been able to make the trip. So, are you ready for some legwork? Go to Ratchet and give this parts order to Wharfmaster Dizzywig -- he'll probably be at the docks. Do this for me, and I'll have more jobs for you. Jobs, my friend, with serious profit potential...Parts for Kravel^36^All^Thousand Needles^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^Kravel Koalbeard^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^^Delivery to the Gnomes^Bring Kravel's Parts to Kravel Koalbeard on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^Here's Kravel's package, <name>. And when you deliver it, tell him... if he wants more special orders, then he'll have to pay his tab!Hearts of Zeal^33^Horde^Scarlet Monastery^Master Apothecary Faranell^Master Apothecary Faranell^Going, Going, Guano!^^^Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity wants 20 Hearts of Zeal.^Why do I need a rare type of guano, you might ask. Well, for this experiment I want to see what effect two diametrically opposed chemical substances can have on each other, especially when both are combined with an ever-toxic agent to ensure the most... ghastly results. In the northeastern peaks of Tirisfal Glades lies the Scarlet Monastery. There the crazed disciples of the Scarlet Crusade congregate, both inside and outside the halls. Which you slay matters not, any of them may have the heart I need.Delivery to the Gnomes^36^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Fizzle Brassbolts^^Parts for Kravel^The Rumormonger^Bring the Delicate Car Parts to Fizzle Brassbolts in Shimmering Flats.^Now that I have what I need, give these parts to Fizzle Brassbolts. He's been waiting a long time for them -- I'm sure he won't miss the little piece I removed from his order... And I wouldn't bother mentioning it to him. It was small and worthless. Trust me.The Rumormonger^36^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Krazek^The Rumormonger^Delivery to the Gnomes^^Talk to Krazek at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.^Now that we've done a service for the gnomes, it's time to do the goblins a favor! I hear that the goblin racer pilot, Nazz Steamboil, didn't always use that name. I wonder why he changed it. I wonder if it's a secret, and... I wonder if he values that secret. If anyone knows the truth, then it's Krazek of Booty Bay, on the southern tip of Stranglethorn. Speak with Krazek and ask him about our goblin pilot. If you can get useful information from him, then we might just turn a profit from it.Dream Dust in the Swamp^36^All^Swamp of Sorrows^Krazek^Krazek^The Rumormonger^^^Bring 10 Specks of Dream Dust to Krazek in Booty Bay. Dream Dust is gathered from the dragon whelps of the Swamp of Sorrows.^Getting the information on Nazz is quite a favor, <name>. Yes, quite a favor. But you've come all the way from the Shimmering Flats to get it... are you willing to travel some more? While I contact my sources, why don't you gather something for me, eh? Hm... what will it be? How about dream dust, from the dragon whelps of the Swamp of Sorrows. Yes, I'd love some dream dust for my snuff pouch! Get it for me, <name>, and I'll give you the information you seek.Rumors for Kravel^36^All^Thousand Needles^Krazek^Kravel Koalbeard^The Rumormonger^^Back to Booty Bay^Bring the Goblin Rumors to Kravel Koalbeard on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^I had to use some of my favors, and gave away a rare bottle of elven wine, and did some heavy deducing myself! But I found the information you seek. Here, I wrote a letter with some very interesting bits on our friend, Nazz Steamboil. Do with it what you will -- it's too dangerous for me to use. Just don't tell anyone where you got it!Back to Booty Bay^43^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Crank Fizzlebub^^Rumors for Kravel^Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout^Bring Kravel's Scheme to Crank Fizzlebub at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.^<name>, you're a <class> I can trust, both to get the job done and to keep your mouth shut while doing it. I've been brewing up a new scheme. It's risky, but if it works then we could both make a bundle! And I think you're just the person to see it through. To start, you must go back to Booty Bay. I apologize, good <name>. I know my last task took you there. But this time, speak with Crank Fizzlebub. Give him this letter. And if he requires aid, do your best to help him. It will be worth the effort.Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout^44^All^Thousand Needles^Crank Fizzlebub^Kravel Koalbeard^^Zanzil's Secret, Back to Booty Bay^Get the Gnomes Drunk, Get the Goblins Drunk^Bring the Fool's Stout back to Kravel on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^I figured out how to use Zanzil's mixture with stout to make a powerful libation. A Fool's Stout. I think it'll be just what Kravel needs, but try it out and let me know how it works. And <name>, don't keep this stuff too long without using it. Zanzil's mixture has a weird effect on the stout's yeast, kicking it into high gear. So it won't stay fresh forever.Get the Gnomes Drunk^44^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Gnome Pit Boss^^Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout^Report Back to Fizzlebub^Bring the Fool's Stout to the Gnome Pit Boss at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles.^We need to try the Fool's Stout on one of the pit crews. If you want to try it on the gnomes, then here -- take the stout and give it to the gnome pit boss. And don't wait too long. This stout will go bad eventually.Get the Goblins Drunk^44^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Goblin Pit Boss^^Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout^Report Back to Fizzlebub^Bring the Fool's Stout to the Goblin Pit Boss at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles.^We need to try the Fool's Stout on one of the pit crews. If you want to try it on the goblins, then here -- take the stout and give it to the goblin pit boss. And don't wait too long. This stout will go bad eventually.Report Back to Fizzlebub^44^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Crank Fizzlebub^^^^Bring the Fool's Stout report to Crank Fizzlebub at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.^That Fool's Stout worked great! I placed a bet on the next race, and... let's hope the crew you got drunk did a number on their car! There's only one more task for you -- take this note back to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay. He'll want to know of the successful test. And hopefully we can get more of that Fool's Stout for future races!Rabine Saturna^55^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^Rabine Saturna^The New Frontier^^Wasteland^Speak with Rabine Saturna in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade. Moonglade lies between Felwood and Winterspring, accessible through a path out of Timbermaw Hold.^For this task, Keeper Remulos' majordomo in Moonglade - Rabine Saturna - seeks aid in exploring the vast wastelands far to the west of Tanaris and Un'Goro. He is located in Nighthaven, the main village of Moonglade. I want to impart on you the importance of your presence. There are growing tensions between the night elves of Darnassus and the Cenarion Circle in Moonglade. Look beyond racial boundaries and tap into the wisdom of your ancestors in dealings with the Circle there, <name>. Good luck.Wasteland^55^All^Moonglade^Rabine Saturna^Layo Starstrike^The New Frontier^^^Speak with Layo Starstrike near the Valor's Rest graveyard of Silithus, showing him Rabine's Letter.^West of Un'Goro Crater, via the northwestern ridge, is a harsh wasteland - Silithus. Few know that an ancient war was waged there between the night elves and a malign, alien power. The evil was sealed, but now we suspect that forces work to stir this... unspeakable horror. Seek out Layo Starstrike, one of our agents in Silithus; look for him at Valor's Rest, the final resting spot for the fallen of the wastes. Give him this letter, and he will give you his trust accordingly.The Spirits of Southwind^55^All^Silithus^Layo Starstrike^Layo Starstrike^The New Frontier^^^Free the spirits of 8 Tortured Druids and 8 Tortured Sentinels in Southwind Village, and then return to Layo Starstrike at the Valor's Rest graveyard of Silithus.^To our southwest lies a tragic site - the ruins of Southwind Village. This is where our work should begin, <name>. From what we've learned, this village was once a night elf base of operations for Silithus. It's long since overrun by the silithid hives that infest the wastes. I can only imagine the horror of the village's initial sundering... The tortured spirits of fallen druids and sentinels wander the ruins aimlessly. Explore this locale, freeing the souls of these wretched beings as needed.Hive in the Tower^57^All^Silithus^Layo Starstrike^Layo Starstrike^The New Frontier^^^Scale the tower of Southwind Village and locate a means to stir the silithid hive into activity. Bring back anything unusual you may uncover when doing so to Layo Starstrike at the Valor's Rest graveyard of Silithus.^The hive needs to be addressed in Southwind Village, and I think I know a way to get at them. It's been my experience that the silithid hives are very sensitive to their environment; this explains their attacks when hearing the death wails of the spirits. The silithid are strongest in the tower - the one with the mass of wasps circling it. Scale the tower and jostle the hive into activity. Report back what you learn, but be careful! If you uncover anything that might help, bring it to me.Fool's Stout^44^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Crank Fizzlebub^Crank Fizzlebub^^^^Bring 12 of Zanzil's Mixture to Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay.^So you want some Fool's Stout, eh? Thinking of heading back to the races...? All right, bring me more of Zanzil's mixture and I'll make some more stout for you.Melor Sends Word^30^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Jorn Skyseer^Melor Stonehoof^Melor Sends Word^^^Speak with Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^<name>, Melor Stonehoof has heard of your deeds, and has set a path before you. If you wish to take it, then go to Thunder Bluff and speak with Melor. You will find him on Hunter's Rise.Steelsnap^30^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Melor Stonehoof^Melor Stonehoof^Melor Sends Word^^Frostmaw^Bring Steelsnap's Rib to Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^At times we hunt for food. At times we hunt for honor. And at times we hunt to earn the Earthmother's teachings. But the hunt I now set upon you is none of these things. It is to slay a creature outside the Earthmother's blessing. The hyena Steelsnap roams the Thousand Needles, south of the Barrens. He is a tyrant, attracting other hyenas to him and spreading fear and bloodshed among more peaceful beasts. Find Steelsnap, <name>. Find him, and defeat him.Pridewings of Stonetalon^21^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shindrell Swiftfire^Shindrell Swiftfire^^The Zoram Strand^^Bring 12 Pridewing Venom Sacs to Shindrell Swiftfire in Astranaar.^We are not in open war with the Horde, but our peace is fragile. We often find their agents moving against us, but they do so covertly. One such advance was revealed to us from hidden sources in Theramore, claiming that the orcs collect venom from the pridewings near Mirkfallon Lake, in the Stonetalon Mountains to the south. Orc assassins then use the venom on their secret death raids against the Alliance! If this is true, then we must stop them, <name>. We must deny them their source of venom.Frostmaw^37^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Melor Stonehoof^Melor Stonehoof^^Steelsnap^^Bring Frostmaw's Mane to Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^<name>, it is now time for you to travel to far-off lands. You are ready. You now hunt Frostmaw, a yeti in the Alterac Mountains. He is elusive, his white coat blending into the snows of his mountain home. He rarely shows himself. But I will show you how to entice a creature such as he. Here, take this scroll. On it I have written how Frostmaw may be lured. Now go, <name>. Your journey is long and many challenges lay waiting. When you return with Frostmaw's mane, only then is your task complete.News for Fizzle^38^All^Thousand Needles^Martek the Exiled^Fizzle Brassbolts^^Indurium^Keeping Pace^Speak with Fizzle Brassbolts on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^Indurium has an amazing resistance to heat! I'm sure it will work for Fizzle's pistons. But he'll need true indurium ore, not just the flakes. To get the ore, it must be mined from deep within Uldaman, on the northern borders of the Badlands. That is the true source of indurium. Send Fizzle Brassbolts my regards, and tell him what I told you. Safe travels, <name>. And it won't surprise me if we meet again -- once Fizzle learns of indurium he'll probably send you to Uldaman to acquire it!Fruit of the Sea^17^All^Darkshore^Gubber Blump^Gubber Blump^^^^Collect 6 Fine Crab Chunks for Gubber Blump in Auberdine.^I love crab. Crabs are the fruit of the sea! You can bake it, barbecue it, boil it, and broil it. They're pan fried, deep fried, and stir fried. There's crab salad, crab soup, crab stew, pepper crab, lemon crab, whipper root crab, and Ironforge surprise crab. That's... that's about it. I'm here fishing right now, so I can't get any fine crab chunks. You can pick them out of reef crawlers and encrusted tide crawlers. You can make a lot with it. You can bake it, barbecue it, boil it...The Lost Tablets of Will^45^Alliance^Ironforge^Advisor Belgrum^Advisor Belgrum^^An Ambassador of Evil^^Find the Tablet of Will, and return them to Advisor Belgrum in Ironforge.^We've slowed the Shadowforge clan by cutting them off from Blackrock Spire, but Hammertoe's quest is still unfulfilled. His death must not be in vain. He dreamt of finding the Tablet of Will: a stone shard inscribed with magic by the titans themselves to help imbue their creations with life--making them have a will of their own, or so the legends say. We must still recover the Tablet before the Shadowforge clan finds it. Return to Uldaman, find the tablet, and return here immediately.The Tower of Althalaxx^28^All^Darkshore^Delgren the Purifier^Delgren the Purifier^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Free the trapped Highborne souls in Night Run and Satyrnaar, then return to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post.^The writing of the orcs is little better than the scribblings of a child. Many of my order scoffed when I chose to learn their tongue, but I have found it beneficial to gain further understanding of my enemies. From Ilkrud's scribblings, it appears that Athrikus still possesses two soulgems, and they are being held in Night Run and Satyrnaar, satyr-held areas in northeast Ashenvale. Be careful out there, <name>, the satyrs' blood-soaked temples can be unsettling even for a seasoned <class> such as yourself.The Family and the Fishing Pole^14^All^Darkshore^Gubber Blump^Gubber Blump^^^^Catch 6 Darkshore Grouper for Gubber Blump in Auberdine.^I love fishing. The Blump family is known for fishing. My name is Gubber Blump; I fish. There's a kind of fish I like to catch around these parts called Darkshore grouper. I used to go out on a boat to fish for grouper, but no boats have been going out since them mean ol' murlocs moved in. I bet they been eating up all the grouper too. Say, you wanna help me catch Darkshore grouper? I'd give you a bona fide Blump Family Fishing Pole if you did! It's a real good pole to catch fish with.Mortality Wanes^30^All^Darnassus^Heralath Fallowbrook^Treshala Fallowbrook^^^^Find and return Treshala's Pendant to Treshala Fallowbrook in Darnassus.^I have not long to live... so... so... weak. ...the b-b-brave dwarf, Lonebrow, has been sent to w-w-warn Falfindel... But before I... d-d-die... ...my wife, Treshala... her pendant of bonding to me... stolen... by one of the f-f-foul aggressors... Find it p-p-please... and return it to Treshala in Darnassus... ...along with w-w-word of my lonely... death.The Tower of Althalaxx^31^All^Darkshore^Balthule Shadowstrike^Balthule Shadowstrike^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Kill Athrikus Narassin and bring his head to Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx.^I see. Well, if what you say is true, then now is the time to strike. I believe Athrikus resides at the top of the tower. Be careful though, he is surrounded by many powerful warlocks, much more deadly than the ones you faced before.Willix the Importer^30^All^Ratchet^Willix the Importer^Willix the Importer^^^^Escort Willix the Importer to the exit of Razorfen Kraul.^At last, help has arrived! You have no clue how long I've been held prisoner here. I can't remember the last time I saw the outside of this place. You see, I am an entrepreneur. Always out for a copper, as they say. I caught wind that Mebok Mizzyrix was paying well for Blueleaf Tuber from this here pig pen. I figured it would be an easy in, easy out kind of affair. As you can see, I was a bit wrong! Anyway, if you'd be so kind as to help me get out of here, I'll make it worth your while.The Swarm Grows^33^Horde^The Barrens^Korran^Belgrom Rockmaul^The Swarm Grows^^^Deliver Korran's Sealed Note to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar.^Many travelers who've come through the Crossroads helped me gather eggs from the Field of Giants, and many of them have tales of how deadly the creatures are. I've heard enough to consider them insects a much larger threat than my masters first thought. I need a courier to travel to Orgrimmar to meet Belgrom Rockmaul. It be no simple matter, and someone who would take the task seriously should go. Belgrom usually be found outside the warriors' guild house.The Swarm Grows^33^Horde^Orgrimmar^Belgrom Rockmaul^Moktar Krin^The Swarm Grows^^^Deliver Belgrom's Sealed Note to Moktar Krin in Thousand Needles.^So, Korran has come to a similar conclusion about these insects--they seem to be a larger threat than we assumed. A few days ago a hunter returned to me from Thousand Needles nearly dead. He was with a raiding party sent to drive a dwarven excavation team out of the Shimmering Flats. During the attack, more of these insects erupted from a cave in the dig site and nearly killed the party. They were led by Moktar Krin, and they've taken refuge on the border of the Shimmering Flats. Bring him this note.The Swarm Grows^35^Horde^Thousand Needles^Moktar Krin^Moktar Krin^The Swarm Grows^^^Kill 5 Silithid Searchers, 5 Silithid Hive Drones, and 5 Silithid Invaders and return to Moktar Krin in Thousand Needles.^Hmm. Seems Belgrom thinks those monsters are a threat. He wants them pushed back into whatever depths they crawled up out of. I guess killing the dwarves sent by the Explorers' League wasn't enough--now I have to send a half-dead war party into another battle. We won't be able to do it ourselves; not while we're in this condition. The dig site's to the south of here. There shouldn't be anymore dwarves to deal with. Feel up to wielding a blade or staff and doing your part to aid us?Parts of the Swarm^35^Horde^Thousand Needles^Cracked Silithid Carapace^Korran^Parts of the Swarm^^^Bring 1 Silithid Heart, 5 Silithid Talons, and 3 Intact Silithid Carapaces, to Korran at the Crossroads.^You inspect the carapace carefully. As you turn it over in your hands you realize that the chitinous plating is interlaced in such a way that makes it incredibly strong. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. You inspect the rest of the corpse further and realize that these creatures are very powerful and highly evolved. Looking down at the carapace again, you think that Korran would enjoy studying more of these creatures. It could help him figure out what these creatures are, and where they come from.Test of Faith^26^Horde^Thousand Needles^Dorn Plainstalker^Dorn Plainstalker^Test of Faith^^^If you have faith, leap from the planks overlooking Thousand Needles.^So, you have sought me out, or perhaps destiny brings you to me? No matter. You are here now, and so your journey will begin anew. Many facets make up a being: the spirit, the body, the mind. Some of these can be measured by a culture's traditions. Others we can only hope exist within ourselves. If you agree, I shall test some of the facets within you. If you pass, then you shall become stronger. If you fail, then you will realize the vastness of the Nether. The first is a Test of Faith.Test of Endurance^30^Horde^Thousand Needles^Dorn Plainstalker^Dorn Plainstalker^Test of Faith^^^Bring Grenka's Claw to Dorn Plainstalker in Thousand Needles.^I'm pleased to see your courage remains steadfast in light of what you've already done. Since your faith is intact, the time has come to test your body. First is a test of endurance. Go to the Roguefeather Den west of Freewind Post. Make your way to the depths of their lair and destroy their foodstuffs. By then you should have provoked their fury, and if you are able to survive long enough, Grenka Bloodscreech herself will come for you--kill her and bring me her claw to complete your test.Test of Strength^30^Horde^Thousand Needles^Dorn Plainstalker^Dorn Plainstalker^Test of Faith^^^Bring Fragments of Rok'Alim to Dorn Plainstalker in Thousand Needles.^During the time of the Old Gods, elementals inhabited much of this world. They worshipped the Old Gods, and the Gods, through their power, kept the elementals bound to this world. When the Old Gods were banished, the elementals faded from our world and now only return at the bidding of powerful mages. There are exceptions though. Some elementals were powerful enough to remain here on their own. One such elemental is Rok'Alim. To test your strength, find Rok'Alim in Thousand Needles and slay him.Test of Lore^30^Horde^Thousand Needles^Dorn Plainstalker^Braug Dimspirit^Test of Faith^^^Find Braug Dimspirit near the entrance to Talondeep Path in Stonetalon Mountains.^Your time with me is just about finished. I am knowledgeable, but the Test of Lore is not mine to give. There are lessons to be learned and places to visit that others claim domain over. If you are prepared, then seek out Braug Dimspirit--he is a shaman of great wisdom. He will test you further, so heed his words, <name>. When you are ready, find the tunnel that connects the Stonetalon Mountains with Ashenvale: Braug dwells near there. And be careful, <name>, the night elves may wish to impede your test.A New Ore Sample^29^Horde^The Barrens^Tatternack Steelforge^Tatternack Steelforge^^Weapons of Choice^^Find an Unrefined Ore Sample on a Gravelsnout Digger or Surveyor and bring it to Tatternack Steelforge at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.^<class>, you have done well in helping me in the past. The warchief is pleased thus far with what I've accomplished, and asks me to continue with renewed determination. My honor dictates that I give you proper recognition to the warchief for all you have done, but first I would ask you for your help again. Travelers recently came from the south from a place called Thousand Needles. There they killed a kobold who had an unusual ore sample, but they would not sell it. I want a sample of that ore to examine.Test of Lore^30^Horde^Thousand Needles^Braug Dimspirit^Braug Dimspirit^Test of Faith^^^Find the Legacy of the Aspects and return it to Braug Dimspirit near the entrance to Talondeep Path in Stonetalon Mountains.^You have passed Dorn's tests, and now you seek to pass your next trial. Very good. But up until now, your challenges have been childish. It is easy to test your body--your mind is another matter completely. I shall explain it simply: find the book I name, study it, and answer my question about its contents. What book, you must be asking? The Legacy of the Aspects. It can be found at the bottom of Dor'danil in southern Ashenvale, protected by the dead druids and their slayers.Test of Lore^30^Horde^Thousand Needles^Braug Dimspirit^Parqual Fintallas^Test of Faith^^^Find Parqual Fintallas in Undercity.^Well done, <name>. You have passed the first portion of the Test of Lore, but there is still another question to be answered. But that question is not mine to ask. Seek out Parqual Fintallas in Lordaeron City. He was a great historian for the humans before the Plague overtook him. Now he continues to seek enlightenment, but of a different nature. He will have another requirement of you before he asks you anything, but you have done masterfully thus far--I'm sure you will overcome his obstacle.Test of Lore^36^Horde^Scarlet Monastery^Parqual Fintallas^Parqual Fintallas^Test of Faith^^^Find The Beginnings of the Undead Threat, and return it to Parqual Fintallas in Undercity.^I will tell you what you must seek, and I will even ask you my question, but not because you wish to prove yourself. Knowledge is far more important than strength. Even as others seem to pass you by in ability, your knowledge of the world will be more valuable. Go to the Monastery in the north of Tirisfal Glades. In the library there, a book called Beginnings of the Undead Threat resides. It was used by the now-corrupt paladins there to train them to fight my kind. Bring it to me.To Steal From Thieves^36^Horde^Undercity^Genavie Callow^Genavie Callow^^^^Bring Kenata, Fardel, and Marcel Dabyrie's Heads to Genavie Callow in Undercity.^The harlot! The swine! Kenata still lives; her family healthy and prospering while I suffer. Forsaken indeed! My family is gone, taken by the plague. Our estate also forfeit; looted and burned during the war. And after all that, her and her lousy children had the audacity to steal the only precious belongings I had left. I don't care about the things they stole any more. What I want now are their heads! Kill them for me! Go to the Dabyrie Farmstead in Arathi, northeast of Refuge Point.Overlord Mok'Morokk's Concern^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Overlord Mok'Morokk^Overlord Mok'Morokk^^^^Overlord Mok'Morokk in Brackenwall Village wants you to retrieve his grog, snuff and strongbox in Dustwallow Swamp.^Bow before Overlord Mok'Morokk! Rexxar make me mighty leader of Stonemaul Clan! Me good leader. Me keep clan safe. Big dragons come and make fire at old home. Me smart ogre. Find new home for clan here. Leave old home so fast, me forget stuff. Tiny <race>, go get my things. Go south and find my yummy grog, my snuff and my strongbox. Me like you after you do that. You look in Den of Flame and Stonemaul Ruins... they be there, me sure!The Tower of Althalaxx^28^All^Darkshore^Delgren the Purifier^Balthule Shadowstrike^The Tower of Althalaxx^^^Speak with Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx.^Before confronting Athrikus, it would probably be wise for you to consult with Balthule. I have no doubt he has been vigilant in his watch of the Tower, and he may have information about recent developments.Army of the Black Dragon^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Tharg^Tharg^^^^Tharg in Brackenwall Village wants you to kill 10 Firemane Scouts, 10 Firemane Ash Tails, and 5 Firemane Scalebanes.^Mok'Morokk was made Overlord by Rexxar. He care more for power than he care for ogres. Black dragons kill many ogre. Kill Tharg's wife. Mok'Morokk tell us to run. Make us come here. Ogre should fight. Ogres not good at running. Mok'Morokk care only about Mok'Morokk. Me call Stonemaul Ruins home. Me like it in the south. This place not home. Help ogres fight army of the black dragon. Me want revenge. Me want to go home.Identifying the Brood^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Draz'Zilb^Draz'Zilb^^^The Brood of Onyxia^Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village would like you to bring him 7 Searing Tongues and 7 Searing Hearts.^Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home. Why the puzzled stare, <name>? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre? Now back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil...The Brood of Onyxia^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Draz'Zilb^Overlord Mok'Morokk^The Brood of Onyxia^Identifying the Brood^^Speak with Overlord Mok'Morokk in Brackenwall Village.^Stonemaul Village was invaded by the brood of Onyxia. But why would the daughter of the black dragonlord, Deathwing, descend upon our lands? This is most troubling. Surely, Onyxia was driven here for a purpose beyond laying siege to a small band of ogres. Notify Mok'Morokk at once! Action must be taken.The Brood of Onyxia^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Overlord Mok'Morokk^Draz'Zilb^The Brood of Onyxia^^^Speak with Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village.^You leave me alone now. Go tell Draz'Zilb we stay here. No black dragon here.The Brood of Onyxia^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Draz'Zilb^Draz'Zilb^The Brood of Onyxia^^Challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk^Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village wants you to destroy 5 Eggs of Onyxia.^Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch. Make haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them. We will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground. As for Mok'Morokk... I have other plans for the sod.Challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk^45^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Overlord Mok'Morokk^Draz'Zilb^^The Brood of Onyxia^^Defeat Mok'Morokk and report the news to Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village.^You dare challenge Overlord Mok'Morokk? Haw! Me crush tiny <race>! You tell me when ready for good beating.A Bump in the Road^33^All^Thousand Needles^Trackmaster Zherin^Trackmaster Zherin^^^^Kill 10 Saltstone Basilisks, 10 Saltstone Crystalhides and 6 Saltstone Gazers for Trackmaster Zherin on the Shimmering Flats.^After the big crash with the goblins' Red Thunder racer and a basilisk, Kronkrider hired me on to take care of the track. I don't know what all the animals out on the flats are feeding on to grow so big, but we have to be careful to thin them out so they won't wander onto the track when a race is going on. Tell you what. If you want to go out and make a little profit, go out and remove the basilisks from the area.Load Lightening^30^All^Thousand Needles^Pozzik^Pozzik^Load Lightening^^^Get 10 Hollow Vulture Bones for Pozzik in the Shimmering Flats.^When it comes to racing, every bit counts! Whether it's a minor tweaking on the power output, a slight slackening on the tension coils, or lightening the weight of the frame, you have to take everything into account. We use vulture bones for a lot of the minor structural tweaks we make to our racers, which offer the perfect balance of strength and weight. Even better, it's easy for us to get more, as the salt flats are littered with vultures. Bring me some and I'll give you a good price on them.Hungry!^36^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Mudcrush Durtfeet^Mudcrush Durtfeet^^^^Mudcrush Durtfeet in northern Dustwallow wants 8 Mirefin Heads.^Mud big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you.Goblin Sponsorship^37^All^Thousand Needles^Pozzik^Gazlowe^Load Lightening^^^Speak to Gazlowe at Ratchet in The Barrens.^Our racing team is the pride of goblins everywhere. You'd be surprised at some of the people who contribute in one way or another to our team. You know Gazlowe? He tracks down parts from around the world for us. He even came down to work on one of our rigs once! A few weeks ago, he said he'd send us a new prototype fuel regulator but it hasn't come yet. He's usually very prompt... Maybe you wouldn't mind going to Ratchet to ask him about it? I wouldn't be so pushy, but the gnomes are gaining on us!The Brassbolts Brothers^30^Alliance^Thousand Needles^Pilot Longbeard^Wizzle Brassbolts^^^^Bring the crate of crash helmets to Wizzle Brassbolts at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles.^You ever heard of the Shimmering Flats? It's a stretch of salt flats way over in Kalimdor, just south of the Thousand Needles canyon. It's a great place for racing because, well, it's so flat! A couple of gnome brothers are out there, friends of mine, trying out their new rocket car, and from what I hear it's fast! Heh, so fast that their pilots keep crashing. Giving themselves concussions. So they asked me for some Siege Engine helmets, but I have duties here. I can't make the trip! Can you?Goblin Sponsorship^37^All^Thousand Needles^Gazlowe^Wharfmaster Lozgil^Load Lightening^^^Speak with Wharfmaster Lozgil at Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.^Back to what you came here about. I know I promised Pozzik that I'd deliver a new fuel regulator for him, but I still haven't received it yet. Revilgaz over in Booty Bay said he'd have it shipped over, but it might be it slipped through the cracks somehow. If that's true, there's not much we can do about it. We can at least find out if it was dispatched from Booty Bay. Check in with Wharfmaster Lozgil over there, he should be able to check the cargo records.Goblin Sponsorship^37^All^Thousand Needles^Wharfmaster Lozgil^Baron Revilgaz^Load Lightening^^^Speak with Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay.^I'm afraid I can't be of much more help to you, <name>. If you'd like to follow up on it more, I'd suggest you go hit up the Baron himself. If there's anyone who knows Revilgaz's business, it's Revilgaz. You'll find him at the tavern across the harbor, top floor.Goblin Sponsorship^37^All^Thousand Needles^Baron Revilgaz^Baron Revilgaz^Load Lightening^^^Bring the Fuel Regulator Blueprints to Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay.^See, the Venture Company shredders out in Lake Nazferiti (in northern Stranglethorn) have been equipped with a new model fuel regulator. I was thinking that Pozzik would be able to take advantage of it, if he could get some details. Unfortunately, Cozzle, the foreman out there, appears to be a little more clever than I gave him credit for. You seem like you might have more luck finding the blueprints though. I know he keeps them in his house, but they're almost certainly under lock and key.Goblin Sponsorship^37^All^Thousand Needles^Baron Revilgaz^Pozzik^Load Lightening^^^Deliver the Fuel Regulator Blueprints to Pozzik on the Shimmering Flats.^You should be all set to go. Give Pozzik my regards and tell him that if he ever needs anything, not to hesitate to ask. I'll be waiting for the news that he breaks the track record soon!Parts of the Swarm^35^Horde^Thousand Needles^Korran^Belgrom Rockmaul^Parts of the Swarm^^^Return to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar.^Head back to Belgrom in Orgrimmar and tell him Moktar be doing his bidding well out in the Thousand Needles. Tell him also, that me studies progress, and I hope to be havin' learned more soon. That should please him greatly.The Eighteenth Pilot^37^All^Thousand Needles^Pozzik^Razzeric^Load Lightening^^^Speak with Razzeric on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^I'm going to be busy with working on integrating this new fuel regulator to our racer designs, but if you'd like to help out the team some more, talk to Razzeric. He's our pilot--well, our eighteenth pilot, to be exact--and he likes to add his own little modifications to the racers. He's a little off his rocker, though, so try not to act too surprised.Razzeric's Tweaking^41^All^Thousand Needles^Razzeric^Razzeric^Load Lightening^^^Retrieve the Seaforium Booster for Razzeric in the Shimmering Flats.^Pozzik's a great mechanic, I know that, but he's afraid to just load on the firepower and grab on for the ride. Not me, though. After Pozzik finishes with a racer, I take a little time to put my own modifications on--you know, loosening up the controls, removing parts of the frame, and adding more juice! I ordered a seaforium booster from Shreev at the Gizmorium in Gadgetzan, but apparently the zeppelin it was being sent on crashed in Dustwallow Marsh! I gotta have it, <name>!Safety First^41^All^Thousand Needles^Razzeric^Shreev^Load Lightening^^^Bring the Seaforium Booster to Shreev at Gadgetzan in Tanaris.^But wait, what's this? Shreev left the safety on. That will limit the amount of power I can draw from the booster at any time. I told him I wanted it off! This is no good. You have to take this to the Gadgetzan Gizmorium in the Tanaris Desert and have Shreev remove this.Safety First^41^All^Thousand Needles^Shreev^Razzeric^Load Lightening^^^Return the Modified Seaforium Booster to Razzeric on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^There, I did what Razzeric wanted. Just tell him to be careful when he sets this off. If he makes the slightest mistake, he won't be moving forward, he'll just be a burnt spot on the track. Would be a shame, too, if that happened. Who knows if our nineteenth driver would be any good?Keeping Pace^41^All^Thousand Needles^Pozzik^Rizzle's Unguarded Plans^Keeping Pace^News for Fizzle^^Have Zamek create a diversion, then steal Rizzle's plans for Pozzik on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^The Brassbolts brothers have discovered a new building material, that's the only explanation that makes sense. Their cars have been operating faster than before, but their designs, and all the other data we've gathered from their runs is identical. What we do know, is that Rizzle Brassbolts has been focused on the plans for this new discovery almost constantly. Zamek can create a diversion for you, so that you can steal those plans from them.Rizzle's Schematics^41^All^Thousand Needles^Rizzle's Unguarded Plans^Pozzik^Keeping Pace^^Indurium Ore^Bring the Sample of Indurium Ore to Pozzik on the Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles.^Rizzle's schematics describe the process of the refinement of indurium ore. From his scrawls, it is apparent that indurium ore is being obtained from the dwarven excavation site of Uldaman in the Badlands. Much of the other notes relate to the heat resistant properties. Used as a paperweight for the plans is a hunk of what appears to be unrefined indurium ore.The Sacred Flame^25^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Zangen Stonehoof^Zangen Stonehoof^The Sacred Flame^^^Return a Filled Etched Phial to Zangen Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^The Galak centaur in the Thousand Needles are protecting an artifact from the time of the centaurs' creation. We would like to retrieve it, but we require a phial of water from one of the night elves' moonwells. To collect the water, you will first need to obtain one of the phials carried by the dryads near the Raynewood Retreat in the heart of Ashenvale Forest. There is a moonwell near the western bank of the Falfarren River, south of the main road, where you can fill the phial.The Sacred Flame^29^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Zangen Stonehoof^Rau Cliffrunner^The Sacred Flame^^^Deliver the Filled Etched Phial to Rau Cliffrunner at the Freewind Post.^Bring the filled phial to Rau Cliffrunner at the Freewind Post in southeastern Thousand Needles. You can get to the Thousand Needles by taking the Great Lift at the southern edge of the Barrens. I wouldn't be surprised if you can help us out further.The Sacred Flame^29^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Rau Cliffrunner^Rau Cliffrunner^The Sacred Flame^^^Retrieve the Cloven Hoof for Rau Cliffrunner at the Freewind Post.^Using the water you brought, you will be able to temporarily douse the flame that holds the centaur relic. It will not work permanently, however, so you will have to be quick about it. You will find Splithoof Crag, the centaurs' stronghold, to the north of here. The flame is kept in Splithoof Hold, a heavily guarded part of the crag. Be careful, though, the Galak centaur have great numbers here, and will be rather reluctant to surrender something so dear to them.In Search of Thaelrid^24^Alliance^Blackfathom Deeps^Dawnwatcher Shaedlass^Argent Guard Thaelrid^In Search of Thaelrid^^^Seek out Argent Guard Thaelrid in Blackfathom Deeps.^Many rumors circulate these days about the union of the Twilight's Hammer and the naga in Blackfathom Deeps on the coasts of Ashenvale. My role here with the Argent Dawn is to collect as much information as I can, so we know when and where help is needed. It has been weeks now since I sent a scout to check on the activity at Blackfathom Deeps. Argent Guard Thaelrid has not yet reported back. My other scouts are preoccupied with pressing matters. Seek out and aid Thaelrid for me, <name>.Twilight Falls^25^Alliance^Blackfathom Deeps^Argent Guard Manados^Argent Guard Manados^^^^Bring 10 Twilight Pendants to Argent Guard Manados in Darnassus.^Empowered by the ancient rites of the chaotic Old Gods the members of the Twilight's Hammer strive to bring about the return of their dark patrons and spread death and terror across the world. We believe that the Twilight's Hammer has allied with the naga and are amassing in Blackfathom Deeps on the coast of Ashenvale. Whatever evil plan brews in the depths of the old temple must be thwarted. Wage war on the Hammer and bring back proof of your deeds. Your efforts will be rewarded handsomely.Blackfathom Villainy^27^Alliance^Blackfathom Deeps^Argent Guard Thaelrid^Dawnwatcher Selgorm^In Search of Thaelrid^^^Bring the head of Twilight Lord Kelris to Dawnwatcher Selgorm in Darnassus.^Strength has left me. Your help is needed! Long ago this site was a great temple of Elune. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an Old God seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred Moon Well. Aku'Mai, servant of the Old God, rose from the waters. The Twilight's Hammer cultists have allied with the naga to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power. Slay Kelris and bring his head to Selgorm in Darnassus, <name>, please.Theramore Spies^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Nazeer Bloodpike^Nazeer Bloodpike^Theramore Spies^^^Kill 9 Theramore Infiltrators, then return to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.^The Horde and Alliance hold an uneasy truce. Outlying skirmishes and covert actions are taken by one side against the other, and it is our duty to ensure the Horde is on top! Now is the chance to do just that. Alliance infiltrators have taken positions east of Brackenwall Village. They spy on the village and report our movements to Theramore, which we cannot allow. Hunt down the infiltrators and slay them. Send a clear message to their superiors that we will not tolerate their spies' presence!The Theramore Docks^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Nazeer Bloodpike^Nazeer Bloodpike^Theramore Spies^^^Bring the Captain's Documents to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.^<name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks. They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea. One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize. He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you. The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks. Find those documents, <name>, and bring them to me.Jarl Needs a Blade^35^All^Dustwallow Marsh^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^The Hermit of Witch Hill^^^Bring Razorspine's Sword to "Swamp Eye" Jarl at Swamplight Manor.^I have cutting to do. I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but... I need myself a blade. A certain blade... Some people call it a sword. I call it a swing blade. You help me? Those fish-men, you know, murlocs or whatever they're called.... There's one they call Razorspine, carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need! But don't sleep on this. What I'm cutting won't keep forever...Mudrock Soup and Bugs^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Morgan Stern^Morgan Stern^Morgan Stern^^^Bring 8 Forked Mudrock Tongues to Morgan Stern in Theramore.^I'm working on a dish I call "Mudrock Soup and Bugs." I still need the major ingredients, and... well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh! So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me? First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles. You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay. But I don't want just any tongues! I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked... They say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish...Deadmire^41^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Melor Stonehoof^Melor Stonehoof^^^^Bring Deadmire's Tooth to Melor in Thunder Bluff.^Deadmire is an ancient crocolisk in Dustwallow marsh. And it is his time to die. Old bones grind as he pulls his huge body through the swamp, and although he still moves with the strength and speed of youth, his aging body tortures the great spirit within it, a spirit whose flame will not waver. Yet now he lives in constant, maddening pain. You must end the life of this noble creature, <name>. You must lead Deadmire to peace.Jarl Needs Eyes^35^All^Dustwallow Marsh^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^The Hermit of Witch Hill^^^Bring 20 Unpopped Darkmist Eyes to "Swamp Eye" Jarl at the Swamplight Manor.^Eye juice is good juice for drinking. Too bad most critters only have two eyes. But spiders have lots of eyes. Lots and lots. And Darkmist eye juice is tasty. Smooth and salty! Unpopped spider eyes... I taste them already. Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern. You figure the spiders are named after the cave... or is it the other way around?Marsh Frog Legs^35^All^Dustwallow Marsh^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^The Hermit of Witch Hill^^^Bring 10 Marsh Frog Legs to "Swamp Eye" Jarl in Dustwallow Marsh.^I like cooking. Good swamp cooking. Fried green frog legs and the like. And I'm all out of legs. The manor is overrun with frogs, though. Giant marsh frogs. Think you could bring me some of those legs? Nothin' to it, really. Just bop 'em on the head and bring me the legs. Then I'll make a stew and stew it up and suck it down and give you some too. Do you like stew?The Orc Report^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Loose Dirt^Lieutenant Aden^The Orc Report^^^Bring the Spy's Report to Lieutenant Aden in Theramore.^Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found. And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube. And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment. The parchment is written in orcish... and it looks important.Captain Vimes^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Theramore Lieutenant^Captain Garran Vimes^The Orc Report^^^Bring the Spy's Report to Captain Garran Vimes.^Captain Vimes should see the orc report you found, <name>. He knows the orcish language better than most. And he should know that there are Horde spies near Theramore! The captain is in the barracks, on the northeastern side of Theramore Isle.Blueleaf Tubers^26^All^The Barrens^Mebok Mizzyrix^Mebok Mizzyrix^^^^Grab a Crate with Holes.^Blueleaf tubers are a delicacy around the world! But they're rare, very rare. The only place to find them is here in the Barrens, deep in the earth, in Razorfen Kraul. And even then, they're impossible to find unless you know just where to look! That's why I've trained these snufflenose gophers to find them for me. They have great noses and can smell a tuber from fifty paces away. It won't be easy, but if you get me some tubers I'll pay you handsomely.Stinky's Escape^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^"Stinky" Ignatz^Morgan Stern^^^Feast at the Blue Recluse^Escort "Stinky" Ignatz, then speak with Morgan Stern in Theramore.^Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me! I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. The cook Morgan Stern is researching a new recipe, and he sent me out here to gather bogbean leaves. I guess he thinks they're tasty. Anyway, while looking for a bogbean plant... I got myself surrounded! Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for the bogbean?The Lost Report^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Loose Dirt^Nazeer Bloodpike^^^The Severed Head^Bring the Spy's Report to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.^Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found. And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube. And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment. The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of Theramore. After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village.The Severed Head^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Loose Dirt^Nazeer Bloodpike^The Severed Head^The Lost Report^^Bring the Defiant Orc Head to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.^Vigorous digging reveals the head of a male orc, raggedly severed at the neck. His lips are frozen in a snarl, and its dark eyes stare defiantly.The Troll Witchdoctor^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Nazeer Bloodpike^Kin'weelay^The Severed Head^^Marg Speaks^Take the Defiant Orc Head to Kin'weelay in the Grom'gol Base Camp in Stranglethorn Vale.^We must know the events surrounding Marg's death! And the only way to do that, <name>, is through the witch-magic of trolls. Bring Marg's head to Kin'weelay in Stranglethorn Vale, at the Grom'gol Base Camp. Kin'weelay is the most powerful witchdoctor of the Darkspear trolls. If anyone can speak to Marg Nighteye's spirit, it is he.The Missing Diplomat^28^Alliance^Stormwind City^Bishop DeLavey^Jorgen^The Missing Diplomat^^^Find Jorgen in Stormwind City.^Recently a diplomat was sent to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmoore. That diplomat never arrived. I believe the Defias are involved in this plot, but I'm not sure how. The diplomat's disappearance still eludes public attention, but it can't remain that way for long. Agents of the king are already scouring the city for clues, but I have my own contacts I would like involved. In the Valley of Heroes is an old friend of mine named Jorgen. Find him, give him this note, and follow his instructions.The Missing Diplomat^28^All^Stormwind City^Jorgen^Elling Trias^The Missing Diplomat^^^Delivery Jorgen's Sealed Note to Elling Trias in Stormwind City.^Take this here note to Elling Trias. Don't say nothin' else to him. Just be polite and wait for him to respond. And don't worry, he will. I'm gonna only impress this on ya once more, <name>: treat this matter seriously, and keep your yapper shut. Ya can find Trias at his cheese shop, Trias' Cheese, in the Trade District. Good luck.The Missing Diplomat^28^Alliance^Stormwind City^Elling Trias^Watcher Backus^The Missing Diplomat^^^Give the Sealed Note to Watcher Backus in Duskwood.^Jorgen, you ol' sonuva.... So, that's how it's going to be, huh? All right, I can deal with that. I hope he finds the Twisting Nether that much sooner! Here's what's gonna happen, <name>. I'll start using my contacts here, but you're doing most of the footwork so I save some coin. Head to Darkshire in Duskwood and find Watcher Backus--he usually patrols the north road right outside of town. Just tell him you're looking into any Defias activity for me and he'll help you out with any information he can.The Missing Diplomat^30^Alliance^Stormwind City^Watcher Backus^Watcher Backus^The Missing Diplomat^^^Find the Defias Docket and return it to Watcher Backus in Duskwood.^Defias activity? Well, there's always some activity; even if they keep to themselves we consider them a threat. But now that I think about it, there was a recent sighting that seemed odd. It must have been a couple weeks ago, but some of their agents had gathered around Addle's Stead. From the report, I'd guessed something big went down. Why don't you check there first and bring me back anything you find? The farmstead is south of the road from Westfall just as you enter Duskwood.The Missing Diplomat^30^Alliance^Stormwind City^Watcher Backus^Elling Trias^The Missing Diplomat^^^Bring the Defias Docket to Elling Trias in Stormwind.^Whoa, this looks way too complex to be something to just lead you astray. I shouldn't even be looking at this stuff. Take it to Trias--he'll be able to make sense of it. And DON'T let anyone get in your way. This is bigger than me. It might even be bigger than him, but we'll see. And do me a favor, <name>, don't tell anyone I helped you. If my superiors found out I knew about any of this and didn't share it with them they'd probably hang me.The Missing Diplomat^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Elling Trias^Dashel Stonefist^The Missing Diplomat^^^Speak to Dashel Stonefist in Stormwind.^Yeah, now that I think about it... Dashel... Dashel something... What was his name? FIST! Dashel Stonefist. They call him Fist in some circles--probably on account that he likes to get in brawls. You can find him in Old Town usually--right smack dab in the center of it. Go talk to him. If you have to, use a sword or something heavy and blunt to persuade him to open up some. And don't hesitate. If he's in this as deep as these papers suggest, then he's not going to give you any information willingly.The Missing Diplomat^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Dashel Stonefist^Elling Trias^The Missing Diplomat^^^Speak to Elling Trias in Stormwind.^So yeah... um... I might know something 'bout that meeting at Addle's Stead. Happened a few weeks back I think. I really didn't have any part in it. Me part was done when plan A failed... damn adventurers. The guy we got on the inside for plan B came out of Menethil; guy called Slim. That's all I know regarding their backup plan.The Missing Diplomat^33^Alliance^Stormwind City^Elling Trias^Mikhail^The Missing Diplomat^^^Speak to Mikhail in the Wetlands.^A contact of mine retired in the Wetlands at the harbor city of Menethil. He should be willing to help on your word alone if you tell him you're working for me. His name is Mikhail. He mentioned becoming a bartender before leaving Stormwind a few years ago. Speak to him, find this Slim, and find out if there's anything else to know about this kidnapped diplomat. We need to find out where they've taken him, or at least who he is. The docket doesn't mention anything about their plans after he's captured.The Missing Diplomat^33^Alliance^Stormwind City^Mikhail^Mikhail^The Missing Diplomat^^The Missing Diplomat, The Missing Diplomat^Subdue Tapoke Jahn before he escapes, and then return to Mikhail in Menethil.^You say Elling sent you here? Well then, the hospitality I expressed is now tenfold. Anything you need, just ask. I will do my best to aid you. Hmm, Slim, you say? Not sure the name sounds familiar, but I'll keep my eyes out for him. Don't look now, <name>, but the gentleman over by the exit is looking over here. He's listening to our conversation a little too intently if you catch my meaning? If I were you, I'd do what you can to subdue him before he makes a break for the door.The Missing Diplomat^33^Alliance^Stormwind City^Tapoke "Slim" Jahn^Mikhail^The Missing Diplomat^The Missing Diplomat^^Speak to Mikhail in the Wetlands.^The Defias didn't pay me well enough to die for their cause. They took the king. Yeah, the king of Stormwind, not some lowly diplomat. He was on his way to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmore--it was a big deal apparently, and a big secret. But it's not just the Defias that are involved. They're working with someone. I think they knew this was bigger than them. My part was just to get their man on board the king's ship while it was in the harbor. The guy's name was Hendel. That's all I know. I swear!The Black Shield^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Black Shield^Krog^The Black Shield^^^Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to Krog in Brackenwall Village.^An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn. The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney.Lieutenant Paval Reethe^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Theramore Guard Badge^Captain Garran Vimes^Lieutenant Paval Reethe^^^Bring Reethe's Badge to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.^A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing away debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore. Underneath the anchor is embossed the name "Lieutenant Paval Reethe".The Black Shield^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Black Shield^Captain Garran Vimes^The Black Shield^^^Bring the Blackened Iron Shield to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.^An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn. The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney.... and Bugs^40^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Morgan Stern^Morgan Stern^Morgan Stern^^Feast at the Blue Recluse^Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to Morgan Stern in Theramore.^Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab. And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- Muckshells they call them -- just won't do! I'm afraid the only suitable crabs live far away, in the Swamp of Sorrows. The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs. An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish. So, <name>... are you willing to travel?Lieutenant Paval Reethe^40^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Garran Vimes^Adjutant Tesoran^Lieutenant Paval Reethe^^^Find out more about Reethe from Adjutant Tesoran in Theramore.^I don't recognize the name of Lieutenant Paval Reethe. Your best bet would be to check with Adjutant Tesoran. He keeps track of all the records for the Theramore guard, from personnel to their equipment. He should be able to tell you who this Reethe is with a quick check of his books.Morgan Stern^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Angus Stern^Morgan Stern^Morgan Stern^^^Speak with Morgan Stern in Theramore.^I'm developing a new menu for the restaurant. It will be filled with rural dishes with a "bayou" theme. I think my clientele at the Blue Recluse will love them! I sent my nephew Morgan to Theramore, a city on the edge of the Dustwallow Marsh. He's there gathering recipes from the locals, and I must know what he found so far. The trip to Theramore is long. Too long for me. But I bet a young <class> like yourself would jump at the chance to travel, yes?Marg Speaks^40^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Bubbling Cauldron^Nazeer Bloodpike^Marg Speaks^The Troll Witchdoctor^^Bring the Jeweled Pendant to Nazeer in Brackenwall Village.^Cursed muckshell! You can't kill Marg! Ah, but I am dead. So it must have slain me... But my mission! My mission! You, <name>, must complete it. While near Theramore, I spied a group of Alliance soldiers camped on the beach. And one soldier wore a pendant... a pendant laden with more gems than any soldier could afford! That night I snuck into their camp and stole the pendant, but on my return to base a muckshell crab-man killed me! <name>, you must find that muckshell and recover the pendant!Report to Zor^40^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Nazeer Bloodpike^Zor Lonetree^Marg Speaks^^Service to the Horde^Bring the Jeweled Pendant to Zor Lonetree in Orgrimmar.^It is strange that the pendant Marg stole was in the hands of common soldiers. Perhaps its owner was in disguise, or perhaps the soldiers themselves stole it! Regardless of which is true, this is a noble's pendant and we must discover its true owner if we are to unravel its mystery. Take the pendant to Zor Lonetree in Orgrimmar. He is well schooled in Alliance politics, and will know if this pendant has a history among the nobles of Stormwind.The Missing Diplomat^33^Alliance^Stormwind City^Mikhail^Commander Samaul^The Missing Diplomat^The Missing Diplomat^^Find Commander Samaul in Dustwallow Marsh.^The beginning of every month the Kul Tiras Marines all get paid and usually leave Theramore for somewhere else. A lot of them come here to womanize, carouse, and just have a good time. One of those groups I'd consider regulars here at the tavern, and I believe this Hendel is among them. Commander Samaul in Theramore would be able to help you find him if Hendel's still stationed there. He's completely loyal to Proudmoore, but if you drop Elling's name, he should help you out... discreetly.The Missing Diplomat^35^Alliance^Stormwind City^Commander Samaul^Archmage Tervosh^The Missing Diplomat^^^Search Sentry Point for any sign of Private Hendel.^Hendel? Yes, I know the man. But why would you need one of my soldiers? Elling sent you to find him? Hmm, I don't like the sound of that. Elling wouldn't have you come to me first if your business wasn't troubling. I understand if you can't tell me what this is about, but know this: I have a duty to protect these lands. If you're going to cause a disturbance, then I suggest you inform me of whatever you can. I believe Hendel was stationed at the first tower outside of Theramore. Be cautious.The Missing Diplomat^36^Alliance^Stormwind City^Archmage Tervosh^Private Hendel^The Missing Diplomat^^The Missing Diplomat^Find Private Hendel in Dustwallow Marsh.^Private Hendel is to the west of here. He's currently on guard duty protecting some of Theramore's infiltrators while they rest. They've been keeping tabs on the Horde base, Brackenwall, and looking for anything else that might threaten our borders. You should have no problem finding him; just look for the tents along the road. I have another matter to attend to, but I shall catch up to you soon enough. You can always find me in the Lady Proudmoore's tower if you have any problems.Suspicious Hoofprints^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Suspicious Hoofprint^Krog^^^^Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Krog in Brackenwall Village.^Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh.Lieutenant Paval Reethe^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Theramore Guard Badge^Krog^^^Questioning Reethe^Bring Reethe's Badge to Krog in Brackenwall Village.^A glint of light on the ground catches your eye from underneath the rubble. Brushing debris and ash caked onto the object reveals the insignia of a gold anchor on white, enameled on the surface: the sign of Theramore. Underneath the anchor is embossed the name "Lieutenant Paval Reethe".Stinky's Escape^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^"Stinky" Ignatz^Mebok Mizzyrix^^^^Escort "Stinky" Ignatz, then speak with Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.^Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!! I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>. A goblin from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something... I honestly don't care why -- his money was good and I know this swamp, so here I am. Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean! Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant?Questioning Reethe^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Ogron^Krog^^Lieutenant Paval Reethe^Return to Krog^Go with Ogron to speak with Reethe, then return to Krog in Brackenwall Village.^It took a long time, but I found Reethe. He hide good for a human. Ogron worried that he might be crazy after so much time in swamp. You come with me for we go get answers from him.The Missing Diplomat^28^Alliance^Stormwind City^Thomas^Bishop DeLavey^The Missing Diplomat^^^Find Bishop DeLavey in Stormwind Keep.^Excuse me, <sir /madam>. Bishop DeLavey asked me to approach adventurers that might be able to help him with a delicate matter. If you could quietly head to Stormwind Keep and speak to him at your earliest convenience, I'm sure he would appreciate your help. Again, please be discreet. It is a matter of some importance.Researching the Corruption^24^Alliance^Blackfathom Deeps^Gershala Nightwhisper^Gershala Nightwhisper^The Corruption Abroad^^^Gershala Nightwhisper in Auberdine wants 8 Corrupt Brain stems.^Foolish blood elves toil with demonic magic. Have they not witnessed what happened with the naga and with the satyrs of Kalimdor? I fear that the blood elves will meet a similar deformation. Azeroth cannot afford to give birth to another vile race of monsters. I wish to study the brain stems of the satyr and naga so that I might deduce what fate the elves are headed toward. In Blackfathom Deeps, on the coast of Ashenvale, you will find both satyr and naga. 'Tis a long journey, <name>.The Black Shield^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Krog^Mosarn^^The Black Shield^^Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Mosarn in Thunder Bluff.^Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before. In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work. Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted. It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have.They Call Him Smiling Jim^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Guard Byron^Captain Garran Vimes^They Call Him Smiling Jim^^Inspecting the Ruins^Speak with Captain Garran Vimes on the top floor of Foothold Citadel.^I can't help it if I feel sorry for ol' Jim there. He wasn't always like that. Ran an inn out in the marsh for a while, wonderful place. Look, I don't really want to talk about it. Bring it up with Captain Vimes if you really have to. He's stationed on the top floor of Foothold Citadel, the large barracks to the east of Lady Jaina's tower.Suspicious Hoofprints^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Suspicious Hoofprint^Captain Garran Vimes^^^^Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.^Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn. There are at least a few visible impressions, with more rows of prints almost imperceptible in the soft mud of the marsh.Daelin's Men^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Adjutant Tesoran^Captain Garran Vimes^Lieutenant Paval Reethe^^^Return the information about Reethe to Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.^Reddon... Redpath... Ah, here it is! Lieutenant Paval Reethe. Joined the Theramore guard along with most of the recruits that came across the sea with Lady Proudmoore. Enlisted with the marines of Kul Tiras at the age of sixteen. Distinguished service, promotions... Listed as missing.The Deserters^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Garran Vimes^Balos Jacken^Lieutenant Paval Reethe^^^Get information about Reethe from Balos Jacken and the deserters in Dustwallow Marsh.^It has been a struggle maintaining a presence in the marsh, but through strength of our resolve, we have been able to maintain several defensive watchtowers throughout the area. The latest information and scouting reports I have received indicate that a group of deserters has squatted in our abandoned tower at Lost Point, southeast of the inn. The local lieutenant seems to be Balos Jacken. See if you can get some information out of him. Be warned, <name>. He may be a tough nut to crack.The Deserters^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Balos Jacken^Captain Garran Vimes^Lieutenant Paval Reethe^^A Grim Connection^Speak with Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore about Reethe.^Reethe? That coward? We threw him out of camp because he insisted on raiding the supplies of the ogres up at Brackenwall Village. We're not so many in number that we could stand up to those mindless brutes. He crossed the line one too many times, so we left him to fend for himself. Now, I helped you out... So, why don't you help us out and forget you bumped into us?James Hyal^35^Alliance^Stormwind City^Connor Rivers^Vincent Hyal^James Hyal^^^Speak with Vincent Hyal in Menethil Harbor.^Before working here at the Blue Recluse, I was trained by one of the best chefs and innkeepers I'd ever met. His name was James Hyal. Everything I have and everywhere I've gotten in life is thanks to him. I wonder how he's doing. His brother Vincent and he went to work in a tavern in Menethil Harbor, but I haven't heard from him recently. If you ever happen to be headed in that direction, maybe you could say hello to him for me?James Hyal^35^Alliance^Wetlands^Vincent Hyal^Clerk Lendry^James Hyal^^Inspecting the Ruins^Speak with Clerk Lendry at Foothold Citadel in Theramore.^My brother James went with Lady Proudmoore across the sea. Last I heard, the fighting had settled down over there, and James was setting up an inn somewhere on the continent. Wherever he is, I'm sure he's doing good business. Damn fine cook he was. I haven't heard from him for a while now--too busy with his inn, I'd wager--but the clerk in Theramore could probably point you to him. Look for him on the top floor of that keep near the middle of the city. What's it called... Foothold Citadel, that's it.Unfinished Gordok Business^60^All^Dire Maul^Captain Kromcrush^Captain Kromcrush^^^^Find the Gauntlet of Gordok Might and return it to Captain Kromcrush in Dire Maul.^Now you da king, so maybe you get prized Gordok artifact back from creepy elf who calls himself Prince!

Caz Twosprocket, one of our best blacksmiths, works the forge at the smithy. Take the shield to him, and see what he can tell you.The Black Shield^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Caz Twosprocket^Captain Garran Vimes^The Black Shield^^^Speak with Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.^Ah, I almost missed this... The leather strap on the back must have burned off, but it seems like it was made to fit a large person. I'd guess a tauren, actually. That's about all I can tell you. Tell Captain Vimes I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.The Black Shield^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Krog^Do'gol^The Black Shield^^^Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Do'gol in Brackenwall Village.^Hmm... I don't see anything out of the ordinary with this shield. We should have Do'gol, the blacksmith, take a look at it, and see if he can tell us more about it, but I wouldn't hold out hope...The Black Shield^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Do'gol^Do'gol^The Black Shield^^^Acquire 5 Acidic Venom Sacs for Do'gol in Brackenwall Village.^Hmmm, there's writing right here on the rim of the shield, but it's hard to read from all the burned stuff. I need acid to make it clear. Venom from the darkmist spiders would do good. The spiders have taken over an old mine, the Darkmist Cavern, northwest of the village. Get me some of their sacs and I can clean this up.The Black Shield^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Do'gol^Krog^The Black Shield^^The Black Shield^Talk with Krog in Brackenwall Village.^Oh, I think I might have dropped too much acid onto the shield. Let me just rub a little... Hm, kind of hard to read, but it looks like the name Mosarn. Never heard of him. Maybe Krog knows. Krog knows many people.The Missing Diplomat^38^Alliance^Stormwind City^Private Hendel^Archmage Tervosh^^The Missing Diplomat^The Missing Diplomat^Defeat Private Hendel in Dustwallow Marsh.^What?! You come here accusing me of allying with the Defias, and think I'll just stand here while you insult me?! Something tells me you've had this coming for a long time.Stormpike's Order^14^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Stormpike^Furen Longbeard^Mountaineer Stormpike's Task^^^Bring Stormpike's Request to Furen Longbeard in Stormwind.^There is a dwarven armorsmith whose work I admire greatly. His name is Furen Longbeard, and his skill is unmatched. I need a new shield, and I must have one of his! The problem is... Furen is far to the south, in the dwarven district within Stormwind. In human lands! I can't imagine why he would live there, so far from Ironforge. The humans must pay him a king's ransom to keep him there! So, if you want to travel and don't mind making some money, then will you send Furen my request for a shield?Mountaineer Stormpike's Task^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Kadrell^Mountaineer Stormpike^Mountaineer Stormpike's Task^^^Speak with Mountaineer Stormpike.^I hear Mountaineer Stormpike is looking for a runner.

If so, then you'll find Stormpike at the top of the northern guard tower.Sample for Helbrim^15^All^Undercity^Apothecary Zinge^Apothecary Helbrim^Escorting Erland^^^Bring the Wolf Heart Sample to Apothecary Helbrim in the Barrens.^A colleague in Kalimdor, Apothecary Helbrim, is researching the effects of Lordaeron toxins on the beasts of Kalimdor. He would be very interested in a sample of the wolf hearts Renferrel sent me. Helbrim is stationed in the Barrens, in a village known as the Crossroads. To reach him, you must travel via zeppelin to the orc capital of Orgrimmar, then travel south, by foot, to Durotar. Head west into the Barrens, and you will soon reach the Crossroads.Zinge's Delivery^15^All^Undercity^Apothecary Renferrel^Apothecary Zinge^Escorting Erland^^^Bring the Wolf Heart Samples to Apothecary Zinge in the Undercity.^The wolf hearts you acquired possess a quality unseen in similar specimens. There is a toxicity to them that should be deadly to the very wolves in which the hearts beat! It's quite incredible, and we must study it further. I kept a few samples of the hearts acquired. Take them to my colleague, Apothecary Zinge. You will find her in our headquarters in the Undercity.Reclaimed Treasures^43^Alliance^Ironforge^Krom Stoutarm^Krom Stoutarm^^^^Get Krom Stoutarm's treasured possession from his chest in the North Common Hall of Uldaman, and bring it to him in Ironforge.^I had myself a fine job as a digger at the Uldaman excavation site in the Badlands... that is until those blasted troggs showed up. I escaped with my hide barely intact, and nothing else. In the chaos, I left my most treasured possession. It's safe from the troggs in my chest, sure, but it's right in the thick of 'em. I'd be in your debt, both in honor and coin, if you could fetch it for me! A chest with my name on it is at the end of the North Common Hall. That's the one you need to get in.Regthar Deathgate^32^Horde^Desolace^Krusk^Regthar Deathgate^Regthar Deathgate^^^Speak with Regthar Deathgate in the Barrens.^A warrior of the Horde, Regthar Deathgate, is recruiting agents for a mission into the land of Desolace. Speak with him if you wish to volunteer. He is stationed in the Barrens, in a series of bunkers west of the Crossroads. And sharpen your weapons. Desolace is a place torn by war.The Kolkar of Desolace^32^Horde^Desolace^Regthar Deathgate^Felgur Twocuts^Regthar Deathgate^^^Speak with Felgur Twocuts at Ghost Walker Post in Desolace.^The Kolkar centaur live in Desolace, and their forces have spread into the Barrens. This is a known fact and we have Horde agents dealing with them here. But as long as the centaur are strong in Desolace, they will always pose a threat. It is time we rid ourselves of that threat. Speak with Felgur Twocuts at Ghost Walker Post in Desolace. He was sent to gather intelligence on the centaur. He will know how to best deal with the Kolkar of Desolace.Mazen's Behest^41^Alliance^Stormwind City^Mazen Mac'Nadir^Acolyte Dellis^Mazen's Behest^^^Speak with Acolyte Dellis in Stormwind.^As caretaker of the works here in the library of the Academy of Arcane Arts and Sciences, it is my responsibility to ensure all the magical tomes and scrolls are accounted for at all times. Who knows what folly would unfold if some of these enchanted texts were to fall into the wrong hands? Which reminds me... my assistant, Dellis, made a horrible mistake last week. He's quite able in the library but incompetent when he leaves the gates of Stormwind. Be a hero, and help old Dellis out, would you?Mazen's Behest^41^Alliance^Stormwind City^Acolyte Dellis^Watcher Mahar Ba^Mazen's Behest^^^Retrieve Khadgar's Essays on Dimensional Convergence and deliver them to Watcher Mahar Ba in Nethergarde Keep.^Master Mazen's directions were quite clear: Deliver a very important essay to Watcher Mahar Ba in Nethergarde Keep. But I had never been to the Blasted Lands before! The journey was frightening! When I got to the Swamp of Sorrows, I made a wrong turn and ended up surrounded by horrible plant-like swamp creatures. They lurched as if to attack me so I ran. But in my haste I dropped the essay. One of the beasts took it I am sure. Could you please try to retrieve it and deliver it to Mahar Ba?Khan Dez'hepah^35^Horde^Desolace^Felgur Twocuts^Felgur Twocuts^^^Centaur Bounty^Bring Khan Dez'hepah's Head to Felgur Twocuts in Desolace.^The Kolkar are not the only centaur of Desolace. Many clans wander these dry plains, fighting and dying against each other. And it is good that they fight among themselves, for they are strong and brutal. If the centaur united against us, they would be a fierce foe. We must deal with them before they unite. Your first task is to disrupt the Kolkar clan. Do this by killing its leader, Khan Dez'hepah. The Kolkar Village is northeast of here. Go, and may fortune go with you.Centaur Bounty^31^Horde^Desolace^Felgur Twocuts^Felgur Twocuts^^Khan Dez'hepah^^Bring 15 Centaur Ears to Felgur Twocuts in Desolace.^Now that you scared the centaur clans, it's time to bleed them. When traveling Desolace, hunt centaur. I don't care which clan you hunt. Just gather ears. A hoard of ears. By weakening their numbers you will weaken their resolve, and stamp out any thoughts of expansion. Good hunting, <name>.Magram Alliance^33^Horde^Desolace^Gurda Wildmane^Warug^Magram Alliance^^Broken Tears^Gain a Friendly reputation with the Magram, then speak with Warug.^To beat the centaur, we must use their hatred against them. We will ally with one of the clans and through them, we will learn how to defeat all the clans. If you choose to ally with the Magram then slay their foes, the Gelkis. This will earn you respect among the Magram. When you earn enough, then meet with the Magram spokesman Warug, on the outskirts of the Magram Village, in southeast Desolace.Gelkis Alliance^33^Horde^Desolace^Gurda Wildmane^Uthek the Wise^Gelkis Alliance^^Stealing Supplies^Gain a Friendly reputation with the Gelkis, then speak with Uthek the Wise.^To beat the centaur, we must use their hatred against them. We will ally with one of the clans and through them, we will learn how to defeat all the clans. If you choose to ally with the Gelkis then slay their most hated rival, the Magram. After you earn the respect of the Gelkis, meet with the Gelkis shaman Uthek the Wise, on the outskirts of the Gelkis Village, in southwest Desolace.Broken Tears^33^All^Desolace^Warug^Warug^Magram Alliance^^^Maintain your reputation with the Magram, and bring 3 Broken Tears to Warug in the Magram Village.^The Gelkis think our centaur mother, Theradras, protects us. They are stupid. No one protects the centaur. The Magram do not need protection! We are the strongest! Show the Gelkis they are stupid. Go to the cave in their village. They hoard crystals in that cave, the tears of Theradras. Destroy the tears and bring me the broken pieces!Stealing Supplies^35^All^Desolace^Uthek the Wise^Uthek the Wise^Gelkis Alliance^^^Bring 6 bags of Crudely Dried Meat to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village.^When we are not at war, we hunt for meat. Meat gives us strength, and full bellies fight harder than empty ones. It is the same with the Magram. They store extra meat so they may fight longer between hunts. If you raid their village to the east and take their stores of meat, then their strength will fail.Gizmo for Warug^35^All^Desolace^Warug^Warug^Magram Alliance^^Khan Shaka^Maintain your reputation with the Magram, and bring an Advanced Target Dummy to Warug in the Magram Village in Desolace.^Long ago, a little gnome came to Desolace. He had horses and a cart, and the cart held strange things. Funny things. Things that burned different colors. Things that moved and weren't alive. I killed the little gnome, but before that... he made me laugh. I kept my favorite thing from his cart. It was a human made of wood and it waved at me until I hit it and broke it. I want a new one. Get me a new one!Nothing But The Truth^42^Horde^Duskwood^Deathstalker Zraedus^Apothecary Faustin^Nothing But The Truth^^^Speak with Apothecary Faustin at Beggar's Haunt.^Our expeditionary force was sent at Varimathras's behest to survey lower Azeroth. While out scouting I noticed a human Infiltrator spying on Beggar's Haunt. Before I could apprehend him, some of our orcish... brethren... captured him and took him to Stonard, their stronghold in Swamp of Sorrows. I want to... help... our orcish allies. They did not see our camp here but nonetheless I want to lend a hand. Work with Faustin here to develop a... truth serum for our friend in Stonard.Ongeku^37^All^Desolace^Uthek the Wise^Uthek the Wise^Gelkis Alliance^^^Maintain your reputation with the Gelkis, and bring a Draenethyst Shard to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village in Desolace.^You have more to prove, and your next task will take you far, so for now the Gelkis will fight the Magram without you. The earth whispers many secrets to those who listen. One secret I hear is of a red crystal. It is called draenethyst, and it is new to our earth. It comes from a place where mountains fly, and where demons rule. Bring me a shard of draenethyst, and it will make my magic strong! The shard is in a place called the Swamp of Sorrows, held by the lost one Ongeku.Khan Jehn^37^All^Desolace^Uthek the Wise^Uthek the Wise^Gelkis Alliance^^^Bring the Khan Jehn's Head to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village in Desolace.^The earth speaks to me, and it says that the Magram grow weak. Now it is time to kill their Khan! Bring me the head of the Magram Khan, Jehn!Khan Shaka^37^All^Desolace^Warug^Warug^Khan Shaka^Gizmo for Warug^^Maintain your reputation with the Magram, and bring the Head of Khan Shaka to Warug in the Magram Village in Desolace.^You help the Magram, and I like you. Now, kill the Khan of the Gelkis! He is Khan Shaka, and I want his head! I want to stare at his head and laugh at him!Khan Hratha^42^All^Desolace^Uthek the Wise^Uthek the Wise^Gelkis Alliance^^^Maintain your reputation with the Gelkis, and bring the Maraudine Key Fragment to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village.^<name>, you helped us against the Magram. Now, help us beat the Maraudine! Kill the head of their clan, Khan Hratha! To face him, blow the Maraudine War Horn. It is atop a high bluff in the Valley of Spears. But to blow the horn, you must gain a warhorn mouthpiece. These are rare, carried only by trusted Maraudine centaur. After the horn is blown, centaur will come. Kill them until Hratha appears. Khan Hratha holds the piece of... a key. Bring it to me...Khan Hratha^42^All^Desolace^Warug^Warug^Khan Shaka^^^Maintain your Magram reputation, and bring the Maraudine Key Fragment to Warug in the Magram Village in Desolace.^The Gelkis Khan is dead, and now the Maraudine will fall! Kill the Maraudine Khan, Hratha! To face him, blow the horn on the high bluff in the Valley of Spears. But to blow the horn, you need a mouthpiece. To get a mouthpiece, kill Maraudine centaur. Keep killing until you find a mouthpiece. Then blow the horn. Do this and Maraudine centaur will come to the tower. Kill them until Khan Hratha appears. Hratha holds the piece of a key. Give this piece to me...Strange Alliance^35^Alliance^Desolace^Captain Pentigast^Uthek the Wise^Strange Alliance^^^Gain a Friendly reputation with the Gelkis, then speak with Uthek the Wise.^We are fortunate the centaur clans fight among themselves, for if they joined into a single force then they would be unstoppable. Yes, we are fortunate, and we should press our advantage. One of the centaur clans, the Gelkis clan, is in brutal war with the Magram clan. If we attack the Magram, then perhaps an alliance may be struck with the Gelkis. Speak with Uthek the Wise, in the outskirts of the Gelkis camps in southwestern Desolace. Through her we might strike an alliance with the Gelkis.Nothing But The Truth^42^Horde^Duskwood^Apothecary Faustin^Apothecary Faustin^Nothing But The Truth^^Nothing But The Truth^Apothecary Faustin at Beggar's Haunt needs 5 Shadow Panther Hearts, Mire Lord Fungus and some Green Whelp Blood.^I have just the right serum in mind. It will deal with the truth in precisely the way the truth should be dealt with. For this concoction I will need several Shadow Panther hearts from the Swamp. I also require the enchanted fungus off of the Mire Lord who resides there. I am sure one as able as you, <name>, can persuade him to part with some. The last item I'll need for the serum is the blood of a dreaming whelp, like the ones that live outside Itharius' cave in the swamp. Now, off you go!Raid on the Kolkar^32^Alliance^Desolace^Uthek the Wise^Uthek the Wise^Strange Alliance^^Stealing Supplies^Maintain your reputation with the Gelkis, and bring 10 Crude Charms to Uthek the Wise in the Gelkis Village in Desolace.^The Kolkar centaurs think their magic is strong. They do not know magic! They would not know magic if it bit them! You will show them their magic is weak. Go to the Kolkar to the northeast and kill them. Take their charms. Bring me the charms and I will throw them in the fire and laugh!Brutal Politics^35^Alliance^Desolace^Captain Pentigast^Warug^Brutal Politics^^^Gain a Friendly reputation with the Magram, then speak with Warug.^Desolace is a land at war. The centaurs wage war with each other, and we believe the victor among them will spill out and threaten our strongholds. That, we cannot allow We must learn how to beat the centaurs, and to do that... we must ally with one of the clans. The Magram centaurs war with the Gelkis. If you fight the Gelkis then the Magram might consider an alliance. Earn the favor of the Magrams then speak with Warug, in the Magram village in southeastern Desolace.Assault on the Kolkar^32^Alliance^Desolace^Warug^Warug^Brutal Politics^^Broken Tears^Maintain your reputation with the Magram. Kill 12 Kolkar Centaurs, 12 Kolkar Scouts and 6 Kolkar Maulers, then return to Warug in the Magram Village in Desolace.^The Kolkar think they are strong, but we laugh at them! We laugh and we kill them! You kill them too. Show me you can kill Kolkar like we do. Head north and slay them all!Centaur Bounty^31^Alliance^Desolace^Corporal Melkins^Corporal Melkins^^^^Bring 15 Centaur Ears to Corporal Melkins at Nijel's Point in Desolace.^Many clans make up the centaur race. Each has its own leader and agenda, but all the clans have one thing in common. Cruelty. If we are to ever find peace, then the centaurs must be removed. And so I put you on the task to do just that. While wandering Desolace, hunt centaur and take their ears. Bring me many, many ears. Do this in service of the Alliance, <name>, and we will be one step closer to war's end.Nothing But The Truth^42^Horde^Duskwood^Apothecary Faustin^Deathstalker Zraedus^Nothing But The Truth^Nothing But The Truth^^Give Faustin's Truth Serum to Deathstalker Zraedus at Beggar's Haunt.^Everything is proceeding according to plan, <name>. I want you to give this truth serum to Deathstalker Zraedus and he'll show you how to administer it.... properly. Haha!Draenethyst Crystals^35^All^Swamp of Sorrows^Magtoor^Magtoor^^^^Bring 6 Draenethyst crystals to Magtoor at The Harborage in the Swamp of Sorrows.^The lost ones who live in the Fallow Sanctuary look as we look, but they are monsters... driven mad by the rigors of our journey to Azeroth. Once our brethren, they now live in the Fallow Sanctuary to the east, catching or killing any who wander near. And they have stolen something sacred to us--draenethyst crystals. We lack the force to enter the Fallow Sanctuary and reclaim our stolen draenethyst from among their huts and campfires, but without those crystals... we too may lose our way.Nothing But The Truth^42^Horde^Duskwood^Deathstalker Zraedus^Infiltrator Marksen^Nothing But The Truth^^^Take Zraedus's Brew to Infiltrator Marksen in Stonard.^We need to operate with a certain amount of discretion. After all, it's not like you're going to waltz in there and convince the fool to drink Faustin's concoction here, right? But if there's one thing those humans cannot deny it's the booze. I'll take Faustin's serum and mix it into this ale. I guarantee the poor sap will show no reluctance when it comes to chug-a-lugging a brew. Make haste to Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows, <name>. And keep our little mission nice and quiet...Noboru the Cudgel^39^All^Swamp of Sorrows^Noboru's Cudgel^Magtoor^^^^Bring Noboru's Cudgel to the leader of The Harborage in the Swamp of Sorrows.^Noboru has plagued the Draenei of the Harborage for months, and his cudgel is a symbol of the brutality they have suffered at the hands of the lost ones.Galen's Escape^38^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Galen Goodward^Galen's Strongbox^^^^Escort Galen out of danger, then find his camp in the Swamp of Sorrows and open his strongbox.^Please help! These creatures are going to eat me! Help me out of here, and I'll give you a great treasure! It's in my camp in the swamp north of Stonard, but it's locked in a strongbox that can be opened through a trick that only I know. If you help me escape, then I'll teach it to you.Final Passage^36^Horde^Thousand Needles^Parqual Fintallas^Dorn Plainstalker^Test of Faith^^^Speak to Dorn Plainstalker in Thousand Needles.^You have done well, <name>. You have passed my test, and the tests before mine. Return to Dorn in Thousand Needles. He will sense the change within you, and see that your mind, body and spirit are strong enough that you should be rewarded for your efforts. Stay true to the balance you've shown throughout these trials, <name>. Dorn will test you again in the future if you do.Supplies for Nethergarde^45^Alliance^Duskwood^Watchmaster Sorigal^Quartermaster Lungertz^Vital Supplies^^^Bring the Crate of Powerstones to Quartermaster Lungertz, before the powerstones expire.^This crate of powerstones needs to go to Nethergarde Keep, in the Blasted Lands. They won't hold their power for long, so we can't ship them with the next caravan. You must take them, and you must take them quickly. Bring them to Quartermaster Lungertz in Nethergarde Keep. To reach the keep, you must travel east through Deadwind Pass, then east through the Swamp of Sorrows, then south through the Blasted Lands. Use caution, <name>. You will travel through dangerous lands, yet you must not fail.Encroaching Wildlife^37^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Watcher Biggs^Watcher Biggs^Help Watcher Biggs^^^Kill 8 Young Sawtooth Crocolisks, 10 Sorrow Spinners and 10 Swamp Jaguars then return to Watcher Biggs in the Swamp of Sorrows.^My caravan was destined for the eastern coast, but we did not reach our goal. Lost Ones attacked us, killing guards and dashing supplies. I alone survived their assault. I have sworn to protect what supplies remain, but wild creatures skulk near. Please, help me defend my camp from the beasts!Driftwood^42^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Watcher Biggs^Watcher Biggs^Help Watcher Biggs^^^Bring 8 pieces of Sundried Driftwood to Watcher Biggs in the Swamp of Sorrows.^I owe you greatly, <name>. An honorable heart beats within you. And now I have another task for which I humbly ask your aid. If I'm ever to reach Nethergarde, then I must fix this wagon. And for that... I will need wood. Strong, dry wood--not the spongy, tangled wood of the swamp's trees. <name>, go east to the coast and search for driftwood that has been dried by the sun. Bring it to me.Neeka Bloodscar^35^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Helgrum the Swift^Neeka Bloodscar^Neeka Bloodscar^^^Speak with Neeka Bloodscar.^The Badlands is harsh and lies close to the Alliance-held land of Loch Modan, so communication between Stonard and the Badlands outpost of Kargath is often cut. Prove yourself, <name>. Travel to the Badlands and speak with Neeka Bloodscar, head scout of the Kargath outpost. Speak with her, and then send her report back to me.Coyote Thieves^40^Horde^Badlands^Neeka Bloodscar^Neeka Bloodscar^^^^Bring 30 Coyote Jawbones to Neeka Bloodscar in Kargath.^Have you spent many days in the Badlands, <class>? Have you felt its heat? Have you faced the beasts that wander its dusty plains? It's time you did. Crag coyotes are a tough breed. Tough, and bold enough to creep into Kargath and steal from our food supplies. Help rid the outpost of these thieves! Hunt crag coyotes, <name>. Hunt them and bring me their jawbones. Bring me enough, and maybe I'll believe it when you say you know the Badlands.Report to Helgrum^40^Horde^Badlands^Neeka Bloodscar^Helgrum the Swift^Neeka Bloodscar^^^Bring Neeka's Report to Helgrum the Swift in Stonard.^I wrote a fresh report for Helgrum in Stonard. Bring it to him. And if you consider yourself an outrunner, then don't lose your way. Or fall to an enemy.The Lost Caravan^35^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Watcher Biggs^Watcher Biggs^Help Watcher Biggs^^^Find the Caravan Chest in the Fallow Sanctuary, obtain the Wizards' Reagents and bring to Watcher Biggs.^I was stunned during the attack by the Lost Ones, but before my sight went black I spied one of our wagons being dragged to the Fallow Sanctuary, the lost one village to the north. A caravan chest with valuable reagents was in that wagon, reagents vital to the studies of the wizards of Nethergarde Keep. Find the chest and get those reagents, <name>. Get them and bring them to me.Threat From the Sea^45^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Tok'Kar^Katar^Lack of Surplus^^^Speak to Katar in the Swamp of Sorrows.^While I begin work on your weapon, why don't you talk to Katar? He mentioned needing help with patrols along the beach, and I'd rather see you keep your wits and weapons prepared instead of getting drunk with some of the other louses I share this camp with.The Lost Supplies^40^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Lost Supplies^Quartermaster Lungertz^^^^Bring the Lost Supplies to Quartermaster Lungertz.^This barrel is small yet sturdy. Its seams are sealed with a yellow, pungent wax. Stamped on the bottom of the barrel are the words: QUARTERMASTER LUNGERTZ NETHERGARDE KEEPPool of Tears^43^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Fel'zerul^Fel'zerul^Pool of Tears^^^Fel'zerul in Stonard wants you to gather 5 Atal'ai Artifacts.^The Warchief sent us to investigate strange happenings at The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. The Atal'ai trolls are a tribe of dark casters, known for practicing forbidden magic. You can imagine how astonished we were when we arrived here to discover the temple had been sunk. The green dragons now guard the site, claiming to be protectors of Azeroth. We need to discover what happened. Explore around the Pool of Tears and gather Atal'ai artifacts. From those I can begin to piece together this puzzle.Deliver the Shipment^42^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Watcher Biggs^Quartermaster Lungertz^Help Watcher Biggs^^^Bring the Shipment to Nethergarde to Quartermaster Lungertz in Nethergarde Keep.^While I fix this wagon, <name>, I have one last task for you. I have packed the most vital supplies saved from the ogre attacks. Take them to Nethergarde Keep. The keep is nestled in the northern hills of the Blasted Lands, keeping watch over the Dark Portal. To reach Nethergard, follow the road east. When it branches head south into the Blasted Lands, then turn left at the next fork. Follow the road, <name>, and be wary.Threat From the Sea^43^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Katar^Katar^Lack of Surplus^^^Kill 10 Marsh Murlocs, 10 Marsh Inkspewer, and 10 Marsh Flesheater, then return to Katar in the Swamp of Sorrows.^I have no love for the sea, nor any creature I've seen come from its depths. It is a powerful but blind mistress; callous and brutal. It would bring me great pleasure to slay the fish men by the hundreds if it were within my power. But I garner some pleasure from watching their deaths at the hands of any who do the Horde's will. Which brings us to you, <class>. How many can you slay? Would you test yourself against their most powerful kind?Threat From the Sea^43^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Katar^Tok'Kar^Lack of Surplus^^Continued Threat^Speak with Tok'Kar in the Swamp of Sorrows.^Before you take rest, speak to Tok'Kar again. While you were gone I believe he finished a few weapons. For your help here, he would offer one of them to you. You would do well to test its strength against the fish men when you are ready... but only to please me further.Continued Threat^45^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Katar^Katar^^Threat From the Sea^^Kill 10 Marsh Inkspewers, 10 Marsh Flesheaters, and 10 Marsh Oracles, then return to Katar in the Swamp of Sorrows.^It pleases me to see your hatred for the fish men grows with mine. Find more of their kind along the beach, and when you've had your fill of combat, return to me. We shall speak then of a reward for your diligence.The Atal'ai Exile^44^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Fel'zerul^Atal'ai Exile^Pool of Tears^^^Bring the Bundle of Atal'ai Artifacts to the Atal'ai Exile in the Hinterlands.^While you were braving the dangers of the Pool of Tears, one of my scouts returned with a scroll written in blood on dried flesh. It seems to be a judicial sentence against a priest of the Atal'ai tribe. This priest was sentenced to a fate worse than death amongst the Atal'ai. He was exiled to live far north in the Hinterlands, with the Witherbark trolls. I will bundle these artifacts. You are to seek out the exile and discover their true use. Return to me once your journey is complete.Fresh Meat^44^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Dar^Dar^^^^Bring 10 Monstrous Crawler Legs to Dar in the Swamp of Sorrows.^There's a high demand for the succulent taste of crawler meat among my customers; especially the meat from the monstrous crawlers. If you plan on heading to the coast, then I could easily make it worth your while to bring me back some of their legs to have transported back to Orgrimmar. The coast is to the east from here, and you should have no problem finding the creatures scurrying along the beaches and under the sea.Alliance Relations^30^All^Orgrimmar^Craven Drok^Keldran^Alliance Relations^^^Speak to Keldran in Orgrimmar.^Be still, <class>, and allow me to share with you something important to our people, but far from obvious. We are a proud race, and the war with the humans tried even Thrall's great patience. You see, our Warchief is wise and prudent, and he continues to put his people first. Ultimately, he is a diplomat, and in his time with the humans he learned much of their ways. If the tale I've started piques your interest, then find Keldran near the western exit of the city. His hovel is there.Alliance Relations^30^All^Orgrimmar^Keldran^Takata Steelblade^Alliance Relations^^Alliance Relations^Speak to Takata Steelblade in Desolace.^As the Alliance progresses deeper and deeper into Kalimdor, incorrect conclusions may be drawn about the Horde making pacts with the Burning Legion. The Warchief cannot allow that to happen. And with his blessing, I am taking control of overseeing them removed. I have agents in the area of Desolace at the Ghost Walker Post north of the great Kodo Graveyard. Head south of the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains and you shall come across it. When you arrive, seek out Takata Steelblade.Alliance Relations^33^Horde^Orgrimmar^Takata Steelblade^Maurin Bonesplitter^Alliance Relations^Alliance Relations^^Speak to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace.^The Burning Blade have many agendas, but know that they are evil to their core, their spirits corrupted, and their destruction is the only way to thwart their objectives. Keldran sent Maurin with me because of his knowledge of the Blade and their warlock ways. He has control of our plots against the Blade while I deal with the other demonic threats here in Desolace. Speak to him, and he will guide you in his designs.Befouled by Satyr^33^Horde^Orgrimmar^Takata Steelblade^Takata Steelblade^^^^Slay 7 Hatefury Rogues, 7 Hatefury Felsworn, 7 Hatefury Betrayers, and 7 Hatefury Hellcallers, and return to Takata Steelblade in Desolace.^A demon infestation does not occur without other influences--something else allows evil to gain a foothold. It may start with a weakened spirit, a needless desire for power; perhaps it's a thirst for revenge, or the appeal for final justice. When we are beset by pain, evil takes advantage of us--evil such as the satyr. Ties have been made between them and the Burning Blade, and Thrall would have them slain. Seek them out to the northeast of here, and return to me when you've driven them back.The Burning of Spirits^33^Horde^Orgrimmar^Maurin Bonesplitter^Maurin Bonesplitter^Alliance Relations^^Alliance Relations^Return the Burning Gem and 15 Infused Burning Gems to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace.^Death is most desirable for those despicable creatures that turn their back on their liege for such selfish reasons. But death is not enough when dealing with those that have given themselves over to the darkness. Take this gem. When one of the Burning Blade's near death, activate its magic. The spell shall pull the corrupted spirit out of its victim, leaving an infused gem behind. Bring me these infused gems so I may dispose of them properly. Go now, and may you elude death.Alliance Relations^33^Horde^Orgrimmar^Takata Steelblade^Keldran^^The Burning of Spirits^^Speak to Keldran in Orgrimmar.^The fight goes well, <name>. Perhaps the Warchief will allow us to return to our homes before the seasons change if we continue to make such great strides in our battle against the demons and their underlings. Return to Keldran and let him know what we have done. I am sure he will reward you for your efforts here. His cause is important to him, and he will take pride in knowing that the Warchief respects his concerns.Vahlarriel's Search^33^Alliance^Desolace^Vahlarriel Demonslayer^Malem Chest^Vahlarriel's Search^^^Find and search Tyranis and Dalinda Malem's wagon in Desolace.^I am Vahlarriel, <name>. I've come here to discover the whereabouts of two missing nobles of a Darnassian merchant family--House Malem. The father of the house fears the worst, and I am to do everything I can to find his missing children. I have yet to start my search for Tyranis or Dalinda, but I am hopeful I shall not be here long. Last word tells of them passing through the Stonetalon Mountains a few weeks ago. If you find their wagon, please, come find me immediately.Vahlarriel's Search^33^Alliance^Desolace^Vahlarriel Demonslayer^Dalinda Malem^Vahlarriel's Search^^^Find Dalinda Malem in Desolace.^Find both Dalinda and Tyranis if you can and come back to me with your findings. Start your search at this fortress. I will contact my superiors in Darnassus immediately and let them know the situation. <name>, there is something else I wish to impress upon you. My superiors have shown some concern over Tyranis' and his motives for coming here. It is more important to them that Dalinda is found and brought back safely. Tyranis is to be... gauged before he is taken home.Search for Tyranis^33^Alliance^Desolace^Dalinda Malem^Dalinda Malem^Vahlarriel's Search^^Return to Vahlarriel^Find Tyranis Malem in Desolace.^We were brought here after the orcs slaughtered all our guards and servants. Oh, the terrible things they did to them! I thought surely they would kill us right there and then, but it became obvious they had other plans. Tyranis attempted to speak to them. I think he wanted to impress them with his knowledge of the arcane... I'm not sure why. Please, I can't leave here until I know what's happened to my brother. Find him, then come back for me when his fate is known.Return to Vahlarriel^33^Alliance^Desolace^Dalinda Malem^Vahlarriel Demonslayer^^Search for Tyranis^^Escort Dalinda Malem from Thunder Axe Fortress and then return to Vahlarriel Demonslayer in Desolace.^So, the time is now then? I appreciate your efforts, and if the situation does not lend itself, then allow me to thank you now for everything you've done for me and my family. If you're ready, then there is nothing else for me here--we can leave when you feel the time is right.Seeking the Kor Gem^22^Alliance^Paladin^Thundris Windweaver^Thundris Windweaver^^The Test of Righteousness^^Bring a Kor Gem to Thundris Windweaver in Darkshore.^Greetings, <name>. What can I do for one who follows a holy path? Ah, yes, Stilwell, the blacksmith... from long ago. I remember him well, though, I have not heard his name in some time. He never struck me as an impudent man, so I can only assume his desire for a Kor gem is noble. If you truly wish for one of the gems, then you must head to the northwest of Ashenvale. You will find Blackfathom Deeps there within some ancient ruins. The naga who still use the gems are down below. Do not go alone, <class>.Return to Fel'Zerul^44^Horde^The Hinterlands^Atal'ai Exile^Fel'zerul^Pool of Tears^^^Return to Fel'Zerul in Stonard.^Jammal'an the Prophet sentenced me to exile from The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I once felt the high priest was a worthy leader. His unyielding faith in his prophecy will bring about the destruction of the Atal'ai. If it hasn't already. When I expressed my concerns, I was labeled an infidel and ousted from the temple. Those artifacts you brought to me are harmless. But if Jammal'an has found the proper fetish enchantment for the summoning ritual, the world lies in great peril....The Temple of Atal'Hakkar^50^All^Swamp of Sorrows^Fel'zerul^Fel'zerul^Pool of Tears^^^Collect 20 Fetishes of Hakkar and bring them to Fel'Zerul in Stonard.^So he spoke of Jammal'an's prophecy? The Atal'ai spiritual leader believes once Hakkar returns to Azeroth from the Nether, the god will grant the Atal'ai tribe immortality. Foolish trickery to bring about a premature doomsday if you ask me. But you say the exile spoke of enchanted fetishes? This concerns me greatly. If these are in fact the key to the Atal'ai ritual which caused this mess, we must understand their intrinsic powers. Venture into the Temple, and seize the fetishes!Jammal'an the Prophet^53^All^The Hinterlands^Atal'ai Exile^Atal'ai Exile^^^^The Atal'ai Exile in The Hinterlands wants the Head of Jammal'an.^My Witherbark companions don't take kindly to strangers around their home. Me? I don't have a home anymore. I was exiled from my people, the great Atal'ai tribe of the Swamp of Sorrows. Our spiritual leader, Jammal'an, had what he called a prophecy. He believes the summoning of the god, Hakkar will bring the Atal'ai immortality. But I urged caution. What if the prophecy was nothing more than manipulation? I want revenge for my exile. Bring me Jammal'an's head. Maybe then my people will be free.The Missing Diplomat^31^Alliance^Stormwind City^Dashel Stonefist^Dashel Stonefist^The Missing Diplomat^^^Defeat Dashel Stonefist in Stormwind.^Yeah, you're obviously not the smartest <class> to come into Stormwind, but you're about to be one of the dumbest to never leave. Have you met me friends?In Search of The Temple^43^Alliance^Stormwind City^Brohann Caskbelly^Brohann Caskbelly^In Search of The Temple^^^Brohann Caskbelly in Stormwind wants you to search for the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.^There was a time when I was young and full of vigor like you, <class>. But now I'm old and unable to explore the world like I once did. Ah, the things I saw! But there was one mystery that eluded me. For my final quest, the Explorers' League sent me in search of The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. It was rumored to be located in the Swamp of Sorrows. Because of my frail state, I traveled the skies by gryphon in search of it but never found it. Help an old dwarf out? Perhaps you will have better luck on foot.To The Hinterlands^43^Alliance^Stormwind City^Brohann Caskbelly^Falstad Wildhammer^In Search of The Temple^^^Speak with High Thane Falstad Wildhammer at Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands.^As I mentioned earlier, I attempted to scout the temple on my own from the air. Well, I wasn't exactly alone. I traveled to the renowned gryphon aviary at Aerie Peak in The Hinterlands. There I enlisted the aid of one of their finest pilots. The pilot fell off his mount, down into the swamp... In my old age the poor fellow's name eludes me. The master of the aviary would remember, no doubt. Journey there and seek out Falstad Wildhammer. We need to find out what happened to that pilot.Gryphon Master Talonaxe^43^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Falstad Wildhammer^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^In Search of The Temple^^^Speak with Gryphon Master Talonaxe inside the Aerie Peak Aviary.^So you're a glorified errand <boy/girl> for some old Explorers' League geezer, eh? Well you listen to me, <class>. I don't know who your old buddy was flying around with down in Azeroth. Do I look like Gryphon Master Talonaxe to you? Do I? If you're so interested in the flight assignments why don't you ask the gryphon master? If I catch you idling around here for much longer, I'm going to put you to some real work. Now get a move on.Rhapsody Shindigger^43^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Rhapsody Shindigger^In Search of The Temple^^^Seek out Rhapsody Shindigger in The Hinterlands.^Rhapsody took quite a liking to the booze. Now don't get me wrong -- all of us dwarves up here at the aviary love a good ale when the time is right. But ol' Shindigger took to the liquor like a gryphon takes to the skies. And a damned shame it was, too. No one could fly like Rhapsody. First sign of trouble was when he came stumbling back from that mission with your buddy, Brohann. All went down hill quickly after that. Had to let him go. Last I heard, he's set up a brew camp to the east of here...Rhapsody's Kalimdor Kocktail^43^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Rhapsody Shindigger^Rhapsody Shindigger^In Search of The Temple^^Rhapsody's Tale^Rhapsody Shindigger in The Hinterlands wants you to bring him 3 Roc Gizzards, 3 Groddoc Livers and 3 Ironfur Livers.^Hiccup! So that crazy fool Brohann sent ya? My we had quite an adventure...Hiccup! If ya want me to tell ya what happened down in the swamp, I'm gonna need me something stiff to drink. It wasn't a pretty scene, ya see. Hiccup! Tell ya what... bring me what I need to whip up a Kalimdor Kocktail and I'll tell ya all about it. Gonna need some Roc gizzards from Tanaris... and let's see... some Groddoc and Ironfur livers from Feralas... A nice stiff Kalimdor Kocktail... that'll get me talking!Reclaimers' Business in Desolace^33^Alliance^Ironforge^Roetten Stonehammer^Kreldig Ungor^^^The Karnitol Shipwreck, Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^Speak to Kreldig Ungor at Nijel's Point in Desolace.^There's work to be done in Desolace, <name>. It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties. But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with Kreldig Ungor, and tell him I sentcha. You can find him holed up at Nijel's Point--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of northern Desolace. Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.The Karnitol Shipwreck^39^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Karnitol's Chest^The Karnitol Shipwreck^Reclaimers' Business in Desolace^^Find Karnitol's Chest in Desolace.^My first order of business is for the mage Karnitol--a noble of some sort in Stormwind. Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of Desolace. He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety. He wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in Stormwind.The Karnitol Shipwreck^39^Alliance^Desolace^Karnitol's Chest^Kreldig Ungor^The Karnitol Shipwreck^^^Return to Kreldig Ungor at Nijel's Point in Desolace.^You take a few moments to figure out what pried the chest open, and you notice along the sides and top of the chest, long, deep scratches that reveal that something other than a man or giant took interest in it. The marks don't appear as if they were caused by dagger or sword. After going through the chest you find it to be completely empty. Not having another course of action, you close the chest and prepare to leave. Kreldig will be disappointed.The Karnitol Shipwreck^39^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Kreldig Ungor^The Karnitol Shipwreck^^^Find Karnitol's Satchel and return it to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.^Intriguing. Well, we might not be without hope quite yet. Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet. If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches.The Karnitol Shipwreck^39^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Roetten Stonehammer^The Karnitol Shipwreck^^^Bring Karnitol's Satchel to Roetten Stonehammer in Ironforge.^Take Karnitol's things back to Roetten in Ironforge and he'll pay you for a job well done. Haha, if you're not careful, he's gonna be so pleased with ya that he'll ask you to join us full time. Again, great job, <name>. Be careful on your way back, and don't take too much time--Karnitol's not the most of patient of men, but he's very generous nonetheless.Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^33^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Kreldig Ungor^Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^Reclaimers' Business in Desolace^^Bring 10 Hatefury Claws, and 10 Hatefury Horns to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.^One of my tasks out here involves picking up some reagents for Leftwitch, a gnome mage in Kharanos . Roetten seems to think it's easy coin in the bank since we're out here already. He doesn't really care that we're short-handed as is. The first few items on his list should be easy enough to get, and it'd be a good chunk of coin for anyone helping me out. I need some horns and claws from the Hatefury satyr to the east of here. Bring 'em back to me and we'll get started on the rest of the list.Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^35^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Kreldig Ungor^Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^^^Bring 7 vials of Scorpashi Venom and 3 Aged Kodo Hides to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.^Next on Leftwitch's list is... let's see... hmm. Oh, here it is. Simple enough, but pretty explicit in his directions. He needs venom from the scorpashi, and hide from some kodo. The fine print says both are from specific creatures: the venom's got to come from any of the scorpashi, and the hide's got to come from an aged kodo, not the dying or ancient ones. Mages, I tell ya, some of the stuff they want... it's just weird.Vahlarriel's Search^33^Alliance^Desolace^Malem Chest^Vahlarriel Demonslayer^Vahlarriel's Search^^^Return the Malem Pendant to Vahlarriel Demonslayer at Nijel's Point in Desolace.^As you continue your search of the wagon you find not only a pendant, but also footprints leading off towards the south. In the distance you can see smoke rising from a large fort. The smoke is from a kept fire, not the burning of buildings, and your instincts tell you that the Malems, if still alive, were taken that direction. You think Vahlarriel at Nijel's Point should not only see the pendant you've found, but also know about the signs of life to the south.Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^40^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Kreldig Ungor^Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^^^Bring 10 Felhound Brains, 10 Nether Wings, and 10 vials of Doomwarder Blood to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.^This is the last of the items, and I won't lie, it ain't pretty. I'm also expecting this to take you a little bit longer than the other items. So, enough with the warning, let's get this started. Leftwitch says he needs: ten brains from either mana eaters, mage hunters, or ley hunters. Ten nether wings from a nether maiden, sister or sorceress. And... ten vials of doomwarder blood from a doomwarder captain, or lord. Simple enough, huh? Sheesh... if you wanna pass on this one, I'd understand.Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^40^Alliance^Desolace^Kreldig Ungor^Roetten Stonehammer^Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.^^^Bring Leftwitch's Package back to Roetten Stonehammer in Ironforge.^To get paid, you're gonna have to get back to Ironforge and speak to Roetten himself. He'll love getting Leftwitch's package out of the way anyway. Just give him this and it should be enough to get your booty. And don't worry, I'm still going to put in a good word for you when I get back. I shouldn't be in Desolace much longer.Rhapsody's Tale^43^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Rhapsody Shindigger^Brohann Caskbelly^Rhapsody's Tale^Rhapsody's Kalimdor Kocktail^^Bring the Atal'ai Tablet Fragment to Brohann Caskbelly in Stormwind.^Before the flight, I drank me a whole keg of stout. Hiccup! And what a flight it was. Zipping around with Brohann following me. Didn't see no temple though. Hiccup! Well, didn't see no temple till I got a little too tipsy and fell off my mount. I plunged right into the water and was sucked down. Found myself surrounded by a bunch of creepy trolls. Sure swam out of there fast! Even made off with this troll souvenir. Here, take it to Brohann and let him know his temple is down there, indeed. Hiccup!The Binding^10^Undead^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Carendin Halgar^Halgar's Summons^^^Using the Runes of Summoning, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Runes of Summoning to Carendin Halgar in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity.^Surely you have seen the circle of summoning below us? Only there will you be able to draw forth an unbound voidwalker. Using these runes, you will be able to draw it forth, and then you must dominate it through strength of arms and magic. When it is subdued, it will be indentured to you. Come to me then, and I will elucidate the spell of summoning, so that it may serve you to whatever end you wish.Devourer of Souls^20^Horde^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Godrick Farsan^Carendin Summons^^Hearts of the Pure^Speak with Godrick Farsan in the Temple of the Damned.^A succubus is a devourer of souls, destroyer of hearts, tempter of men. A creature of profound evil and of singular mind. It cannot be brought into our world without a stimulus. Thus we use its own strength against it. With the hearts of good men, pure men, loving men, the succubus will be unable to resist, and will cross into our world. Then you can dominate it, and make it your own. Speak with my assistant, Godrick Farsan, within the Temple. He will help you find your bait.Creature of the Void^10^Undead^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Carendin Halgar^Halgar's Summons^^The Binding^Recover Egalin's Grimoire and bring it to Carendin Halgar in the Temple of the Damned.^It seems the consensus that you are ready to learn to summon a voidwalker. A being created of the chaos that lies beyond, if you summon one but cannot control it, you will be torn asunder. The first voidwalker was summoned by Egalin, and in his grimoire is the process explained. Unfortunately, it was stolen from us by an agent of the Scarlet Crusade who has it secreted away in his base at a tower to the west. Bring it to me, and I will impart the knowledge to you.The Binding^20^Horde^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Carendin Halgar^Carendin Summons^^^Using the Pure Hearts, summon and subdue a succubus, then return the Pure Hearts to Carendin Halgar in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity.^Using these hearts, cast a spell at the summoning circle to open a doorway for the succubus to come through. Your powers are greater now, and you will need all of them to defeat the succubus. Beware its charms, <name>, many a strong mind has been bound to its will. When overcome, the succubus will be returned to the void, and I will teach you the spell to summon it forth at your command.Into The Temple of Atal'Hakkar^50^Alliance^Stormwind City^Brohann Caskbelly^Brohann Caskbelly^Rhapsody's Tale^^^Gather 10 Atal'ai Tablets for Brohann Caskbelly in Stormwind.^According to legend, The Temple of Atal'Hakkar is a holy shrine dedicated to the ancient god, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Maintained by a vicious tribe of trolls named the Atal'ai, the temple is rumored to be impenetrable. Now sunk beneath the Pool of Tears, retrieving artifacts from the temple is even more difficult. But that's what I need you to do, <name>. Aid me by gathering the intact Atal'ai Tablets. Bring them to me and I will return to the Explorers' Guild a hero. Together we will share the glory.Hearts of the Pure^20^Horde^Warlock^Godrick Farsan^Carendin Halgar^Carendin Summons^^^Bring the hearts of Dalin Forgewright and Comar Villard to Carendin Halgar in the Temple of the Damned.^Men of honor and goodness? Does such a man exist? It took much research, but through bits of overheard stories, I managed to find two men that should do. The first is Dalin Forgewright, who has dedicated himself to the care of the Lordaeron refugees, whom are refused by their kin at the Greymane Wall. The other is Comar Villard, a man who remains faithful to his lost love, wandering the Wetlands for a sign of his wife. Deliver their hearts to Carendin. But first, let me show you your quarry.Vital Supplies^45^Alliance^Stormwind City^High Sorcerer Andromath^Watchmaster Sorigal^Vital Supplies^^^Speak with Watchmaster Sorigal at Darkshire in Duskwood.^Our mages are conducting research at Nethergarde Keep in the Blasted Lands, research vital to our understanding of the Dark Portals. They require nearly constant supplies, but our supply line to Nethergarde is tenuous. You must help ensure the supplies make it to Nethergard. Report to Watchmaster Sorigal in Darkshire, and do as he asks. This task will take you into hostile lands, <name>. Prepare yourself.Halgar's Summons^10^Undead^Warlock^Ageron Kargal^Carendin Halgar^Halgar's Summons^^^Speak with Carendin Halgar in the Undercity.^Ah, <name>! I just received word from Carendin Halgar that he would like to see you for further training. You should be proud of yourself, <name>. It's not every day that Master Halgar personally sees fit to instruct a young warlock. You'll be able to find him in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity, near the Temple of the Damned.The Corrupter^33^Horde^Desolace^Flayed Demon Skin (old2)^Maurin Bonesplitter^The Corrupter^^^Bring the Flayed Demon Skin to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace.^The torn skin smells rotten, and is remarkably pliable for something that appears to be dry and fragile. As you unroll it, you can clearly see the red markings of some kind of language on one side. At the bottom of the skin is a very clear symbol that you guess is a signature of some kind. Perhaps it is something Maurin could tell you more about?The Corrupter^33^Horde^Desolace^Maurin Bonesplitter^Maurin Bonesplitter^The Corrupter^^^Bring a Shadowstalker Scalp to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace.^I believe I can find this demon lord given the proper reagents. If he is indeed as powerful as I suspect, I will need items gathered from deadly creatures. But you act in the Warchief's name, so I am sure you will accept my task. First, I will have to break any wards he has against scrying. For this, I will need the scalp from a satyr--but not any satyr. The scalp must come from a Hatefury shadowstalker. Search for them among the ancient ruins in the northeast of Desolace.The Corrupter^35^Horde^Desolace^Maurin Bonesplitter^Maurin Bonesplitter^The Corrupter^^The Corrupter^Bring an Oracle Crystal to Maurin Bonesplitter in Desolace.^An oracle crystal would do nicely. They are crafted by the naga for their oracles to use. Northwest of here, along the coast, is a vast coral reef that the naga have taken as their home when this close to the shore. You can find their oracles there. The Slitherblade are deadly and will not react kindly to your intrusions, so be careful and make haste. When you return, we shall see about finding this demon lord Azrethoc.Ziz Fizziks^21^All^The Barrens^Sputtervalve^Ziz Fizziks^Ziz Fizziks^^^Speak with Ziz Fizziks in Windshear Crag in Stonetalon Mountains.^The Venture Company stole many of the best goblin minds, but from time to time, we get the opportunity to steal some back. A while ago, the Venture Company outfit in the Stonetalon Mountains hired Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle--a gnome! Their other engineer, Ziz Fizziks, was so taken aback by this, he pleaded with me to find him new employment with the Tinkers' Union. I set him on a few tasks, but he might need help. Maybe you could look in on him for me? He's stationed at the western edge of Windshear Crag.The Corrupter^33^Horde^Desolace^Maurin Bonesplitter^Takata Steelblade^^The Corrupter^The Corrupter^Speak to Takata Steelblade in Desolace.^This creature is far more dangerous than I had anticipated. No doubt Takata questions my abilities to take on such a creature, and it would insult his honor if he were not informed about what just happened. Speak to the swordsman, tell him you are willing to slay the demon if he would allow it, but do not press too hard. It is better if he thinks it his own idea.Deviate Hides^17^All^Wailing Caverns^Nalpak^Nalpak^^^^Nalpak in the Wailing Caverns wants 20 Deviate Hides.^As Naralex descended deeper into his nightmare, a strange breed of beasts arose from beneath the Barrens into the Wailing Caverns. These deviate creatures have strange, otherworldly properties. While evil in nature, it is my opinion that some good can come from their existence here in Kalimdor. I believe their hides will be of particular use in the ways of leatherworking. If you feel up to the task, venture into the caves below and retrieve some deviate hides.Deviate Eradication^21^All^Wailing Caverns^Ebru^Ebru^^^^Ebru in the Wailing Caverns wants you to kill 7 Deviate Ravagers, 7 Deviate Vipers, 7 Deviate Shamblers and 7 Deviate Dreadfangs.^Naralex had a noble goal. Our great leader aspired to enter the Emerald Dream and help regrow these harsh lands back into the lush forest it once was. But something went terribly wrong. Naralex's dream turned into a nightmare and corrupt creatures began to inhabit the caverns. While some Disciples of Naralex seek to awake our master, my concern is with ridding these caves of the evil beasts. Brave the caverns, <name>, and eradicate the deviate spawn.The Corrupter^40^Horde^Desolace^Takata Steelblade^Takata Steelblade^^The Corrupter^^Slay Lord Azrethoc and Jugkar Grim'rod and return to Takata Steelblade in Desolace.^Although I have no knowledge of this Lord Azrethoc, I agree with Maurin, he must be stopped; especially if he is attempting to gain influence over the Burning Blade to further his goals. You have already shown you wish to aid the Warchief, and I would trust you to gather a party to slay the demon lord and his warlock servant. When you are ready, head directly south, and return to me when the threat has been ended.Hamuul Runetotem^16^Horde^Wailing Caverns^Tonga Runetotem^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^Hamuul Runetotem^Altered Beings^^Speak with Hamuul Runetotem.^The shells you brought me have a taint, one I have never before seen. I am certain the water of the Oases is the cause, and I can sense the confusion they cause this land. It is as if the land dreams and cannot awake. The Wailing Caverns must be the source of the taint. But before you go there, speak with Hamuul Runetotem, the elder druid. I sent word to him of the happenings in the Barrens. He is wise, and can offer you counsel. You will find him in Thunder Bluff, on the Elder Rise.Nara Wildmane^16^Horde^Wailing Caverns^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^Nara Wildmane^Hamuul Runetotem^^^Speak with Nara Wildmane.^I entered the land of dreams, and dreamed of a cult of druids who dwell in the Wailing Caverns. I saw that their goals were once noble, but they have lost their way. They are now servants of the taint seeping through the Barrens. I am old and my strength fails. I could not long dwell in that dreaming place and know little more of the tainted druids. But Nara is young and her spirit is fierce. She remained in the dreaming when I fled. Speak with Nara. She is in the tent, over yonder.Smart Drinks^18^All^Wailing Caverns^Mebok Mizzyrix^Mebok Mizzyrix^^Raptor Horns^^Bring 6 portions of Wailing Essence to Mebok Mizzyrix in Ratchet.^Ok, so the raptor horns didn't work so well. But that's all right -- no one got rich on their first try! And besides, I think I found something that'll work even better in my smart drinks! There is a substance called Wailing Essence, and I think it is the cause of the strange plants and animals in the Barrens. Get me some and I'll try it in my drink! I heard the essence gathers in ectoplasmic creatures in the Wailing Caverns to the west. Hunt those creatures and gather the essence.Wharfmaster Dizzywig^11^Horde^The Barrens^Apothecary Helbrim^Wharfmaster Dizzywig^^^^Bring the Secure Crate to Wharfmaster Dizzywig in Ratchet.^I have need to send a crate of potions, reagents and other items to my associates in the Old World. Little time I have to actually see them to the dock at Ratchet, and the last caravan has already left. If you could, please take this to Wharfmaster Dizzywig. He will ensure that it is placed on the next boat to Blackwater Cove.Path of Defense^10^Horde^Warrior^Uzzek^Uzzek^Veteran Uzzek^^^Bring 5 Singed Scales to Uzzek at Far Watch Post in the Barrens.^As a warrior, one of our most crucial tasks is... protection. We are the shield of the Horde, and we keep our weaker brethren safe. If you are to join in our ranks, then you must prove your mettle to me. Go to Thunder Ridge in Durotar, where live the lightning hides and thunder lizards. Hunt the beasts! Show me you are tougher than they! Brave their assaults and bring me a stack of their singed scales as proof. Do this, and then I will teach you.Vile Familiars^1^Orc, Troll^Warlock^Ruzan^Zureetha Fargaze^Vile Familiars^^Burning Blade Medallion^Speak with Zureetha Fargaze.^Zureetha has been sending novices like yourself to help cull the numbers of the creatures in the cave near where you fought the vile familiars. I think it would be good for you to gain experience by assisting her. Be sure to tell her that you assisted with the imp problem, she'll probably have a reward for you.Creature of the Void^10^Orc^Warlock^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Gan'rul's Summons^^The Binding^Retrieve the Tablet of Verga for Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.^So few warlocks remain... We risk much, but the risks are warranted. You must quickly reach maturity in your ability if you are to be of use to the Horde and to the Warchief. It is time that you learned a new summoning spell. First, you must recover the Tablet of Verga, which was stolen by warlocks of the Burning Blade and is now kept at their lair in Skull Rock to the east of the city. With the tablet, I will show you the runes necessary to summoning a voidwalker.Thun'grim Firegaze^10^Horde^Warrior^Uzzek^Thun'grim Firegaze^Veteran Uzzek^^^Speak with Thun'grim Firegaze in the Barrens.^It is vital that a warrior's weapon is one of quality. And if there is an orc who can craft quality weapons, then that orc is Thun'grim Firegaze. He is a hermit who dwells atop the hills east of the Crossroads. If you seek a weapon, warrior, then you should seek Thun'grim. To find him, first travel to the Crossroads to the west, then strike east into the hills. His camp is high on a hilltop.Forged Steel^10^Horde^Warrior^Thun'grim Firegaze^Thun'grim Firegaze^Veteran Uzzek^^^Bring the Forged Steel Bars to Thun'grim Firegaze in the Barrens.^I will give you a weapon, <name>, but first you must aid me. The Razormanes to the northwest came into my camp a few nights past. They would not meet me in combat, but they know my eyes are bad--a few distracted me with snorts while others stole from me! The cowards! They took an iron chest, and within it were some forged steel bars. If you can recover them then I will give you the weapon you seek. Search for the iron box within the quilboar camps, and return with the forged steel bars.The Binding^10^Orc^Warlock^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Gan'rul's Summons^^^Using the Glyphs of Summoning, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Glyphs of Summoning to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.^Now, observe the Tablet of Verga, for it contains the glyphs you will need for the summoning. Take them to the circle in Neeru Fireblade's tent on the other side of the cavern. There you will be able to call for the voidwalker. You must defeat it using whatever physical and magical means you have at your disposal. When this is completed, return to me with the glyphs of summoning and I will demonstrate how you may bind the creature to your will.Veteran Uzzek^10^Horde^Warrior^Krang Stonehoof^Uzzek^Veteran Uzzek^^Path of Defense^Speak with Uzzek at Far Watch Post in the Barrens.^The Horde honors its warriors because their strength is unquestioned. But the truly great warriors are great students as well. Seek out Uzzek. He is a veteran of many battles and now instructs young warriors in the ways of combat. You will find him south of Far Watch Post, the orc garrison on the border of the Barrens and Durotar.Gan'rul's Summons^10^Orc^Warlock^Ophek^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Gan'rul's Summons^^^Speak with Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.^You there. <name>, right? I hope your schedule isn't busy, because Gan'rul wants to see you right away. You'll find him with the senior warlocks in the Cleft of Shadow. Based on my past dealings with Gan'rul, your summons is either a very good thing or a very bad thing.Devourer of Souls^20^Horde^Warlock^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Cazul^Devourer of Souls^^Hearts of the Pure^Speak with Cazul in the Cleft of Shadow.^The time has come for you to learn more of the summoning magics. You will learn to summon a succubus, a creature of incredible mental powers. It can lull those of weak minds into its servitude--but have no fear! I feel certain that you will be equal to the challenge. A succubus can only be summoned when baited with an item that represents great devotion and love. I leave it to you to find such an object. A suggestion? Speak with Cazul... There seems to be little the ancient warlock does not know.Blind Cazul^20^Horde^Warlock^Cazul^Zankaja^Devourer of Souls^^^Speak with Zankaja in Orgrimmar.^Hmm... But, of course, that is not why you have come to speak with me. If Gan'rul has sent you to me, it must be that you are to summon a succubus, and need an object to use for enticement. Hmm... If you trust a blind man to lead you, <name>, then listen. In the bluffs of Orgrimmar, west of the wind rider tower, lives Zankaja. She waits for the return of her mate. Go to her.News of Dogran^20^Horde^Warlock^Zankaja^Gazrog^Devourer of Souls^^^Speak with Gazrog at the Crossroads.^My mate, Dogran, was recently sent to the Crossroads for duty. It was a promotion, and he was very proud. I was sad, of course, but I didn't let him know that. And worried, too. The Barrens is a more dangerous place than Orgrimmar, and I feared the worst. Now it's been a week after he should have returned, and I have received no word from him... Perhaps you could go to the Crossroads and see if they have any news? He worked with Gazrog, who should still be stationed there.News of Dogran^20^Horde^Warlock^Gazrog^Ken'zigla^Devourer of Souls^^^Speak with Ken'zigla at the Malaka'jin.^He was stationed at Camp Taurajo, where we've been trying to weed out the quilboar. He led a few grunts to one of their camps, where he was hurt bad. The others made it back and tried to rescue him. He was in bad shape, his wounds festered, so they were afraid to move him without patching him up first. They sent a message here, requesting a healing draught from the trolls at the Malaka'jin at the base of the Stonetalon Mountains. We sent someone to get it, but they haven't returned yet.Ken'zigla's Draught^20^Horde^Warlock^Ken'zigla^Grunt Logmar^Devourer of Souls^^^Bring Ken'zigla's Draught to Grunt Logmar at Camp Taurajo.^I figured there might be another coming to get the draught, so I prepared it anyways. Here you go, <name>. Mind you, you should only give half of it to him! That will give him enough strength to move without bleeding himself dry. Wait a night, then give him the other half. Anyways, you'll want to bring this to Logmar at Camp Taurajo. From what the first one told me, he should have an idea where this Dogran is.Love's Gift^20^Horde^Warlock^Grunt Dogran^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Devourer of Souls^^^Bring the Dirt-caked Pendant to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.^Zankaja is young and beautiful. To be chained to an invalid... I will not allow her to suffer that injustice. Leave me, <name>. And thank you. I may end my life in glorious battle, instead of a lifeless husk. And please, I would ask you not to tell my mate of this... I do not want guilt on her conscience.The Binding^20^Horde^Warlock^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Devourer of Souls^^^Using Dogran's Pendant, summon and subdue a succubus, then return Dogran's Pendant to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.^Take this to the summoning circle in Neeru's tent, <name>. Summon forth a foul succubus, then show it your mastery. I believe in the strength of your magic. As always, though, be wary, for pride and overconfidence has overcome many a promising warlock. When you have defeated it, return the pendant to me so that I might deliver the news to Zankaja.Dogran's Captivity^20^Horde^Warlock^Grunt Logmar^Grunt Dogran^Devourer of Souls^^^Bring Ken'zigla's Draught to Dogran in the Barrens.^You've made it this far, so if you want to see this through to the end, I won't stop you. I can't spare you any additional manpower though, you'll be on your own. Dogran is being held in a quilboar camp to the north of here. Look for a group of two huts. He'll be heavily guarded--that is, if they haven't killed him yet, or he hasn't succumbed to his wounds. Good luck.Call of Earth^4^Orc, Troll^Shaman^Canaga Earthcaller^Canaga Earthcaller^^^Call of Earth^Bring 2 Felstalker Hooves to Canaga Earthcaller in the Valley of Trials.^The time is now, young <class>. You've grown strong and your spirit endures like the earth. Following the shaman's path shows you have wisdom before even proving yourself.

This is what earth asks of you. In the end, you shall become one with the earth--respect it as it shall respect you.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Searn Firewarder^Kranal Fiss^Call of Fire^^^Find Kranal Fiss in the Barrens.^Fire be witcha, mon.

The element of fire is yours for the understanding, if you're prepared to pay for it. Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the night elf lands, you've gone too far.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Kranal Fiss^Telf Joolam^Call of Fire^^^Bring the Torch of the Dormant Flame to Telf Joolam in Durotar.^You are powerful enough to wield the totem of fire, but that does not mean you are ready. Along the Southfury River in Durotar, before the Great Sea, lies a hidden trail to one of the highest peaks in the land. Find your way to the top and you shall find one of our holy shrines watched over by Telf Joolam--the Shrine of the Dormant Flame. Take this torch to him--it marks that you attempt to tame fire. Return it to me aflame by the brazier at the shrine and I will see you are given the totem of fire.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Telf Joolam^Telf Joolam^Call of Fire^^^Bring 1 Fire Tar and 1 Reagent Pouch to Telf Joolam in Durotar.^But you did not come here for a history lesson, did you? You came for the Eternal Flame and fire totem. The first step is to create a sapta and bind you to the flame. I can create the fire sapta for you if you bring me two items. The first is fire tar, a simple item usually carried by Razormane spellcasters in eastern Barrens. The second item will be more dangerous: a reagent pouch from one of the cultists of the Burning Blade. You can find them in a cave above the ravines northeast of Razor Hill.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Telf Joolam^Brazier of the Dormant Flame^Call of Fire^^^Defeat the Minor Manifestation of Fire, and place the Glowing Ember in the brazier atop the Shrine of Eternal Flame.^The fire sapta is finished. The time has come for you to face the flame. Use the sapta at the shrine and head to the top of the mountain to face the manifestation there. He will not attack until you are ready, but he will realize you are able to see him. Strike him down swiftly, <name>, for he shall only grow in power the longer you take to slay him. Once he is defeated, place his glowing embers within the brazier and light the torch.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Brazier of the Dormant Flame^Kranal Fiss^Call of Fire^^^Bring the Torch of Eternal Flame to Kranal Fiss in the Barrens.^Torch firmly in hand, you turn away from the brazier and look out over Durotar.

She is along the eastern coast, south of the Southfury River and Ratchet. You will find her there at her fishing hut. Good luck to you, <name>.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Islen Waterseer^Brine^Call of Water^^^Find Brine at Blackthorn Ridge in Southern Barrens.^If there is one lesson you must learn of water, it is this: water means rebirth. Its power flows, erodes, and makes clean all manner of things. You will find its ability to heal and replenish incomparable, but only when it is pure. When you understand that water, when polluted, can devastate all that it touches, you will appreciate how vital a resource it is. If you wish the water sapta, find Brine deep in Southern Barrens. Her home is continually molested by the quilboar there.Call of Air^30^Horde^Shaman^Searn Firewarder^Prate Cloudseer^^^^Find Prate Cloudseer in Thousand Needles.^You be makin' headway now, mon.

She will teach you more.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Brine^Brine^Call of Water^^^Fill the Empty Blue Waterskin at the Ruins of Stardust in Ashenvale and return to Brine in the Barrens.^Take this waterskin and head deep into the lush forest the night elves call Ashenvale. It is to the far north of the Barrens. Once you've entered the forest, travel west. Along the mountains that separate Stonetalon and Ashenvale, and beyond Lake Mystral, you will find a holy place: the Ruins of Stardust. At the center of the lake you will find a small fountain. Bring me a sample of the fountain's water. It will be the final component you'll need before I send you back to Islen.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Brine^Brine^Call of Water^^^Fill the Empty Brown Waterskin at the watering hole below Brine's hut and return it to her in the Barrens.^To find understanding and gain the sapta from me, you must seek out only the purest forms of water. As you fetch the samples for me, take note of your surroundings. Be aware of the creatures that rely on the water, that protect it. See how it affects forests and deserts. Witness how the very substance that sustains life will force creatures to take lives. We shall start with a simple task: down below my hut there is a pond of the precious liquid. Fill this skin with it and return to me.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Brine^Brine^Call of Water^^^Fill the Empty Red Waterskin at the well in Tarren Mill and return to Brine in the Barrens.^Long ago I followed some companions into the Hillsbrad Foothills. We defended ourselves from some tenacious humans who make their home there and we found ourselves in a small town the Forsaken had taken over: Tarren Mill. It was there I found a most peculiar thing: in the center of town was a small well of fresh spring water. I'm not sure the plagued citizens of the town even realize its value--it's a small holy vestige in an unhallowed sea. Bring me a sample of that water in this waterskin.Tooga's Quest^50^All^Tanaris^Tooga^Torta^^^^Show Tooga the way back to his wife, Torta.^I am so lost! My wife, Torta, sent me out to fetch dinner and I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. Would you be so kind as to lead me back to Torta? She's waiting for me just south of Steamwheedle Port.Supplying the Front^12^Alliance^Blacksmithing^Tormus Deepforge^Thorvald Deepforge^^^^Bring 6 Copper Axes and 6 Copper Chain Belts to Thorvald in the southern guard tower of Loch Modan.^The mountaineers of Loch Modan are fighting troggs, and having a busy time of it! They need constant supplies of new armor and weapons if we're ever to get a handle on those troggs. That's why my colleague Thorvald is there, trying to keep the mountaineers in good gear. So if you were to make some copper axes and copper chain belts and bring them to Thorvald, he would be obliged. He might even share his knowledge with you. Thorvald is in Loch Modan's southern guard tower.Gaffer Jacks^12^Alliance^Fishing^Wizbang Cranktoggle^Wizbang Cranktoggle^Gaffer Jacks^^^Bring 8 Gaffer Jacks to Wizbang Cranktoggle in Auberdine.^I came to Auberdine because of the quiet. I want to invent my inventions where it's quiet, because after a night of drinking I don't like all the noise of Ironforge! So I took a ship to Auberdine and had a little too much to drink on the way. I dropped my box of gaffer jacks overboard! I need my gaffer jacks! I don't know exactly where I dropped them, but if you fish for them in the ocean you might get lucky...Electropellers^12^Alliance^Fishing^Wizbang Cranktoggle^Wizbang Cranktoggle^Gaffer Jacks^^^Bring 12 Electropellers to Wizbang Cranktoggle in Auberdine.^We know you're lucky, but... just how lucky are you, <name>? One night I was wandering the roads of Darkshore. I was looking for a good river or lake to try my new self-propelled, exploding duck decoy and I think I was a little tipsy... because I passed out and awoke hours later in Auberdine. My hair was singed and my bag of electropellers was gone! I must have dropped them in the water! I need those electropellers! Maybe you can fish them out of some lake or stream in Darkshore...Elixirs for the Bladeleafs^8^Alliance^Alchemy^Syral Bladeleaf^Syral Bladeleaf^^^^Bring 6 Elixirs of Lion's Strength and 2 Elixirs of Minor Defense to Syral Bladeleaf in Dolanaar.^Our herb and alchemy shop is booming, but my husband spends so much time mixing potions that we never have time for each other. Can you help us? If you can bring me a supply of pre-made elixirs, then I would be happy to trade with you. I have some rare herbs that you might find useful.Moonglow Vest^18^Alliance^Leatherworking^Lotherias^Lotherias^^^^Bring 1 Embossed Leather Gloves, 5 Embossed Leather Boots and 5 Embossed Leather Cloaks to Lotherias in Darnassus.^We in Darnassus, especially we craftsman, are quite busy. Young adventurers are eager to test themselves in the wilderness, and are in constant need of supplies. If you can help me fill my orders of leather goods, then perhaps I can teach you an advanced leatherworking technique.Gearing Redridge^16^Alliance^Blacksmithing^Tormus Deepforge^Verner Osgood^^^^Tormus Deepforge wants you to bring 4 Runed Copper Belts and 4 Heavy Copper Mauls to Verner Osgood in Redridge.^We dwarves aren't the only ones fighting. Our human allies have their hands full too! Redridge is under periodic attack from blackrock orcs, and their supply of equipment is always low. If you were to help them out, I'm sure their resident blacksmith, Verner Osgood, would teach you a trick or two.A Warrior's Training^10^Alliance^Warrior^Lyria Du Lac^Harry Burlguard^A Warrior's Training^^Bartleby the Drunk^Speak with Harry Burlguard in Stormwind.^You've shown yourself to be a competent warrior, <name>. But you're still young and have a lot to learn. Speak with Harry Burlguard--he's usually in the Pig and Whistle tavern, in the Old Town of Stormwind. Harry is an old veteran and a good teacher. He can show you a few moves that'll keep you breathing longer.Bartleby the Drunk^10^Alliance^Warrior^Harry Burlguard^Bartleby^A Warrior's Training^^^Speak with Bartleby.^Yeah, I can teach you. But first I wanna see what moves you have already. See that drunk over there at the end of the bar? Bartleby? I want you to get his mug. Hah, and if you know Bartleby then you know he won't just give it to you.Beat Bartleby^10^Alliance^Warrior^Bartleby^Bartleby^A Warrior's Training^^^Beat Bartleby, then talk to him.^You want what?? You're crazy! The only way you'll get this mug is if you pry it from my cold, dead fingers...The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Tome of Divinity^Duthorian Rall^The Tome of Divinity^^The Tome of Divinity^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions. Although called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth. Compassion, patience, bravery--these things mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle. Know this well, and never forget it.The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Duthorian Rall^Stephanie Turner^The Tome of Divinity^^^Search the Trade District of Stormwind for Stephanie Turner.^Your task then, <name>, is to find someone here in Stormwind that is in need of aid. Someone who is pure of heart and motive. Perhaps someone helping others. Perhaps someone in need of a guide. Regardless, the person must have noble intent and be relying on your kindness. Do this, and return to me when you are finished. Then, we shall discuss more of your path and what it means to be a paladin of the Light.The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Stephanie Turner^Stephanie Turner^The Tome of Divinity^^^Bring 10 Linen Cloth to Stephanie Turner in Stormwind.^Bless their hearts, most of them have no families because of the Scourge attacks in the last decade. My husband John collects the materials for me to make the shirts and pants for the children, but I haven't even had time to do that. I've been too focused on keeping food on their plates, and a roof over their heads. What's that? You'd be willing to help? Oh, thank the Light, and thank you, <name>. If you could bring me some linen cloth so I can sew clothes for the kids, that would help me out so much.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Tome of Divinity^Tiza Battleforge^The Tome of Divinity^^The Tome of Divinity^Speak to Tiza Battleforge in Ironforge.^In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions. Although called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth. Compassion, patience, bravery--these things mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle. Know this well, and never forget it.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Tiza Battleforge^John Turner^The Tome of Divinity^^^Search the outer ring of Ironforge for John Turner.^Your task then, <name>, is to find someone here in Ironforge that is in need of aid. Someone who is pure of heart and motive. Perhaps someone helping others. Perhaps someone in need of a guide. Regardless, the person must have noble intent and be relying on your kindness. Do this, and return to me when you are finished. Then, we shall discuss more of your path and what it means to be a paladin of the Light. I will remain here in the temple for your return. Other paladins will need my guidance also.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^John Turner^John Turner^The Tome of Divinity^^^Bring 10 Linen Cloth to John Turner in Ironforge.^My wife and I run an orphanage in Stormwind, mostly for children who have lost parents due to the attacks by the Scourge in the last decade. I come to Ironforge every month or so to see about collecting more supplies from the citizens here, and talk to the various groups to see if they can do anything to help. This trip's been agonizingly slow, and not very productive. If I could just get some more linen for my wife to make some clothes, I could finally send a shipment home.The Tome of Valor^20^Alliance^Paladin^Tome of Valor^Duthorian Rall^The Tome of Valor^^^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^Valor, and all the virtues that go along with it, are like rare minerals: you must cherish them when you find them because of their value, but you must also take time to harvest them... refine them. When mixed together properly, a strong alloy is formed, sometimes unbreakable by even the most powerful blows. This strength, your faith, your bravery, must be tested. You must learn to never lose faith and realize that with the power of the Light, you can overcome things that most others cannot.The Tome of Valor^20^Alliance^Paladin^Duthorian Rall^Daphne Stilwell^The Tome of Valor^^The Tome of Valor^Find Daphne Stilwell in Westfall.^Good! Your lack of hesitation is a sure sign that you are prepared and eager to test yourself. So be it. At the very ends of Westfall's Longshore, a small house overlooks the ocean. There, a couple lives, the Stilwells. Jordan is an incredible smith, and he's gone to Ironforge to meet with the dwarves for a while. But this has left Daphne, his wife, alone and unprotected. Reports suggest that the Defias have all but taken over the area, Daphne may need some protection from the villains. Go there.The Tome of Valor^20^Alliance^Paladin^Daphne Stilwell^Daphne Stilwell^The Tome of Valor^The Tome of Valor^^Defend Daphne Stilwell from the Defias attack.^Now, they'll be coming again soon, I'd wager, so get yourself ready. I've got myself a gun in the house. I'll grab it and be ready to help you out, but for the most part, you're on your own. I've no idea how many they'll send, but I'm sure it'll be more than the few they sent earlier. Ask the Light for whatever blessings you can because... did you hear that? I think they're coming. We make our stand near the house!The Tome of Valor^20^Alliance^Paladin^Daphne Stilwell^Duthorian Rall^The Tome of Valor^^^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^Please, return to Duthorian and let him know that I'm safe for now. I have you and the Church to thank for that. He'll send word to Ironforge to let my Jordan know that he has nothing to fear. Oh, how I miss my husband. I can't wait till he returns.The Test of Righteousness^20^Alliance^Paladin^Duthorian Rall^Jordan Stilwell^The Tome of Valor^^Seeking the Kor Gem^Speak to Jordan Stilwell in Ironforge^Actually, I have no doubt that Jordan himself would like to thank you, and seeing as I need a messenger to send word that his wife is safe, I think you'd be a perfect choice. Jordan was to be a paladin of the Light before his dedication to his father's craft took him on another path--he's intimately familiar with our way of life and is considered among our most faithful. He should still be in Ironforge--he likes to work outside the gates during the day, something about the cool mountain air.The Test of Righteousness^22^Alliance^Paladin^Jordan Stilwell^Jordan Stilwell^The Tome of Valor^^^Using Jordan's Weapon Notes, find some Whitestone Oak Lumber, Bailor's Refined Ore Shipment, Jordan's Smithing Hammer, and a Kor Gem, and return them to Jordan Stilwell in Ironforge.^I'd like to reward you if you'd be willing to accept such a thing? Don't misunderstand me, my generosity is dependent on how much help you can be, but I see us both benefiting greatly from such an alliance. I will craft for you a weapon worthy of what you've accomplished, a symbol of paladinhood and the Light, but you must gather the items I need to craft it. I've already started taking notes on the items, it just requires someone brave and skilled enough to recover them. What do you say, <class>?Bailor's Ore Shipment^22^Alliance^Paladin^Bailor Stonehand^Bailor Stonehand^^^^Bring Jordan's Ore Shipment to Bailor Stonehand in Loch Modan.^Ach, ya startled me, <man/woman>! Can't ya see I was lost in thought? What's that? Jordan's shipment... fer Ironforge. Ahhh, yeah, I know whatcha speak of. Mo'grosh ogres... dat's who took me ol' friend's ore shipment. Caravan was headin' here from the Wetlands and was ambushed. The guard who survived their attack just passed away a few days ago--healer couldn't get to 'em fast enough. If you want the shipment, you'll have to head northeast across the Loch. It's got to be there somewhere.A Task Unfinished^5^All^Mulgore^Antur Fallow^Innkeeper Kauth^^^^Bring the Bundle of Furs to Innkeeper Kauth in Bloodhoof Village.^<name>, please, I beg of you, can you help me? I have not finished my tasks here on the Mesa--I'm in the middle of my Rite of Strength--and my father asked me to deliver these furs to the inn in Bloodhoof. I'm far from rested enough to complete both my rite and this task for my father. Would you mind going on for me? The inn is pleasant and a perfect place to rest during your long travels. I'm sure you'll agree once you see it.Bartleby's Mug^10^Alliance^Warrior^Bartleby^Harry Burlguard^A Warrior's Training^^Marshal Haggard^Bring Bartleby's Mug to Burlguard^Ok, here's my mug. Wait! Let me finish what's in it first... there we go.Marshal Haggard^10^Alliance^Warrior^Harry Burlguard^Marshal Haggard^Marshal Haggard^Bartleby's Mug^^Speak with Marshal Haggard.^You've learned a few moves, but you could still use a decent weapon. I bet if you spoke with Marshal Haggard he could help you. Marshal Haggard lives in a manor in Elwynn Forest, at the Eastvale Lumber Camp. He's retired now but he collected a lot of gear during his career. Let him know I sent you, and with luck he'll have a spare weapon to offer.Dead-tooth Jack^10^Alliance^Warrior^Marshal Haggard^Marshal Haggard^Marshal Haggard^^^Retrieve Haggard's Badge from Dead-tooth Jack's camp, and return to Marshal Haggard.^Burlguard sent you, did he? Yes, I have spare weapons around here, but first I have a task for you... A while ago a Defias villain Dead-tooth Jack tricked me. It was dark and he was wearing a Stormwind tabard and I thought he was Marshal Dughan. He said he needed my old Stormwind Marshal's badge and I gave it to him... and then he laughed and ran off before I could catch him! Get back my badge! Dead-tooth Jack probably has it stowed in his camp to the south.Vejrek^10^Dwarf, Gnome^Warrior^Muren Stormpike^Muren Stormpike^Muren Stormpike^^^Bring Vejrek's Head to Muren Stormpike in Ironforge.^If you want to rise in the ranks of the warriors, then you better be tough. I can teach you new moves but before that, prove to me you can handle yourself against real foes. Vejrek is the toughest troll you'll find in these parts, and he's who you have to beat. He has a hut in the foothills just south of Frostmane Hold. Bring me Vejrek's head and I'll know you have mettle.Muren Stormpike^10^Dwarf, Gnome^Warrior^Granis Swiftaxe^Muren Stormpike^Muren Stormpike^^Bartleby the Drunk^Speak with Muren Stormpike.^Hello, warrior! You show a lot of promise, but you still need to learn some tricks and Muren Stormpike is just the dwarf to teach you. You can find Muren at the Hall of Arms in the Military Ward of Ironforge. Talk to him when you're ready to learn what it is to be a warrior.Tormus Deepforge^11^Alliance^Warrior^Muren Stormpike^Tormus Deepforge^Muren Stormpike^^^Speak with Tormus Deepforge.^Now that you've learned some moves, it's time to get you a decent weapon. Speak with Tormus Deepforge. He can make you a weapon I'm sure you'll like. You'll find Tormus here in Ironforge, at the Great Forge.Ironband's Compound^11^Alliance^Warrior^Tormus Deepforge^Tormus Deepforge^Muren Stormpike^^Grey Iron Weapons^Bring a load of Umbral Ore to Tormus Deepforge in Ironforge.^My mentor, Sturgy Ironband, had a compound south of Helm's Bed Lake in eastern Dun Morogh. There he taught blacksmithing and he was the best. But one day, one of his students brought him a load of strange ore. Master Ironband called it umbral ore and was eager to work with it, but soon after it arrived... a band of Dark Iron dwarves attacked his compound. They killed everyone! Enter Ironband's compound, <name>, and avenge my master's death. And bring me the load of umbral ore that caused it.Vorlus Vilehoof^10^Alliance^Warrior^Elanaria^Elanaria^Elanaria^^The Shade of Elura^Bring the Horn of Vorlus to Elanaria in Darnassus.^Before I can teach you, you must show me your resolve. The satyr Vorlus Vilehoof has found one of our remote moonwells, southeast of the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. He now splashes within it, defiling its pure waters with his filth. Find Vorlus at the moonwell and destroy him. Bring me his horn as proof and I will begin your advanced training as a warrior. The path to the moonwell is hidden well, <name>, but stay focused and alert and you will find it.Elanaria^10^Alliance^Warrior^Moon Priestess Amara^Elanaria^Elanaria^^Bartleby the Drunk^Speak with Elanaria.^Greetings, warrior. Your skill grows, but there is more to your profession than you may believe. To further progress, you must soon find a teacher. The warrior Elanaria dwells in Darnassus, at the Warrior's Terrace. She can instruct you.Gakin's Summons^10^Alliance^Warlock^Remen Marcot^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin's Summons^^^Report to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.^Isn't that how it always works? Was looking for you all day and couldn't find you, now when I'm not expecting it, you come and walk right up to me. I've wasted enough time trying to find you, so I won't delay you any longer. Master Gakin's summoned you for additional training. Seems to me you should seek him out as soon as possible. You'll find him in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb tavern. By the way, you might want to keep that particular location quiet. Don't want word spreading about it.The Shade of Elura^10^Alliance^Warrior^Elanaria^Elanaria^The Shade of Elura^Vorlus Vilehoof^^Bring 8 loads of Elunite Ore and the Medallion of Elura to Elanaria in Darnassus.^You have learned much, <name>. Now we will craft you a weapon. A warrior's weapon. To do this, you must travel to Darkshore. Long ago a ship crashed upon the rocks near the Auberdine lighthouse, scattering many crates of elunite ore along the ocean floor. First, you must defeat the elunite's guardian, the Shade of Elura. Once the ship's captain, she cursed herself to roam the deeps and protect her shipment for all time. Defeat her, gain her medallion, and gather the crates of lost Elunite.Surena Caledon^10^Alliance^Warlock^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin's Summons^^^Retrieve Surena's Choker for Gakin the Darkbinder in Stormwind.^I had a student named Surena Caledon. She stood where you stand now, eager to learn of warlock magic, and possessing no small bit of talent. More than that she was young and pleasing to the eye. Had I seen it then, the traitorous trollop! The thieving wench ran off with one of the Defias, Erlan Drudgemoor. While her loss is of little importance, I gifted her a bloodstone choker that I must have. Her life means nothing to me now. You will find her at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch. Retrieve what is mine.The Binding^10^Alliance^Warlock^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin's Summons^^^Using the Bloodstone Choker, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Bloodstone Choker to Gakin the Darkbinder in Stormwind.^By retrieving my choker and besting Surena, you've proven that you're at least as capable as she was. With that said, I can tell you're direly in need of training. You can manage the flows of magic, yes, but being a warlock is much more than that. I will show you how to command a voidwalker, but before I can, you must call one forth at a summoning circle and subdue it using whatever weapons--physical and magical--you have at your disposal. Use the magic of this choker at the summoning circle below.Wastewander Justice^43^All^Tanaris^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Wastewander Justice^^^Take down 10 Wastewander Bandits and Thieves east of Gadgetzan, then report back to Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle.^You there! It's time for you to be a big helper to the Gadgetzan Water Company. The Wastewander nomads out in the Tanaris desert have seized almost all the water wells! Without access to them, our water supply will dry up in no time. If you want to get in our good graces, then you'll help us bring justice to those nomads! Head east of here and bring down ten Wastewander Bandits and Thieves, then report back to me on the double. Justice waits for no man... goblin... bah, just get on it!More Wastewander Justice^44^All^Tanaris^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle^Wastewander Justice^^^Take down 10 Wastewander Shadow Mages, 8 Wastewander Rogues, and 6 Wastewander Assassins for Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle in Gadgetzan.^We need you to take on the stronger ranks of the Wastewander nomads now. You've done a good job thus far, but if we are to take back those water wells, then it only makes sense to do it against as few nomads as possible! This time around we need you to take down their rogues, assassins, and shadow mages. You'll find them east and southeast of here. I'm not going to lie to you - they're a nasty lot. Do this for us though, and we'll be on our way to taking back what is rightfully ours!Smith Mathiel^10^Alliance^Warrior^Elanaria^Mathiel^The Shade of Elura^^Weapons of Elunite^Bring the Case of Elunite to Smith Mathiel.^I have placed the elunite you gathered into a case. Take it to the blacksmith Mathiel, and he will craft for you an elunite weapon. Mathiel is to the south, on the other side of this building.Yorus Barleybrew^20^Alliance^Warrior^Wu Shen^Yorus Barleybrew^Yorus Barleybrew^^The Rethban Gauntlet^Speak with Yorus Barleybrew.^Yorus Barleybrew has issued a challenge to all able warriors of the Alliance. He waits at the Lakeshire Inn, in Redridge, and pledges a grand reward to anyone able to pass his trial.The Rethban Gauntlet^22^Alliance^Warrior^Yorus Barleybrew^Yorus Barleybrew^Yorus Barleybrew^^The Shieldsmith^Enter the Rethban Caverns, reach the first fork, and return to Yorus Barleybrew within the time allowed.^I call my challenge the Rethban Gauntlet. To pass the trial, all you must do is enter the Rethban Caverns, to the first fork, then return here. Easy! Except there are a few wrinkles... You have to return within an hour. There are whole heaps of Redridge Gnolls in the way. Before you start, you have to take a swig of my family's signature drink: Barleybrew Scalder! So what do you say? The Rethban Caverns are in the foothills north of Lakeshire. Are you ready to run the Rethban Gauntlet?Grimand Elmore^28^Alliance^Warrior^Furen Longbeard^Grimand Elmore^Grimand Elmore^Fire Hardened Mail^^Bring Furen's Notes to Grimand Elmore.^I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and I need them sent to Grimand Elmore. He's here in the Dwarven District, in the weapon shop. And duck when you give these to him. He's fiercely proud of his skills, and won't like the idea of learning something from me...Fire Hardened Mail^28^Alliance^Warrior^Furen Longbeard^Furen Longbeard^The Shieldsmith^^Grimand Elmore, Mathiel, Klockmort Spannerspan, Furen's Armor^Gather the materials Furen Longbeard requires, and bring them to him in Stormwind.^So I gave you a nice shield, but we don't have to stop there. I know the secrets to make extremely hard mail armor. It's not easy and it takes very rare materials, but if you're willing to do the legwork then I'll make a piece for you. What do you say, <name>? If you're up for the challenge, then I'll give you a list of what to get and where to get them.The Shieldsmith^22^Alliance^Warrior^Yorus Barleybrew^Furen Longbeard^The Shieldsmith^The Rethban Gauntlet^^Bring the Cask of Scalder to Furen Longbeard.^You really showed what you were made of when you ran the Rethban Gauntlet, <name>. And I'm true to my word. I'll get you the reward I promised... Except it's in Stormwind. Talk to my friend, Furen Longbeard, in the Dwarven District of Stormwind. He's the best shieldsmith you'll ever meet, and he owes me a big favor. Here, take Furen this cask of Barleybrew Scalder and ask him for a shield. He'll give you a nice one.Mathiel^28^Alliance^Warrior^Furen Longbeard^Mathiel^Mathiel^Fire Hardened Mail^^Bring Furen's Notes to Mathiel.^I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and need them sent to the blacksmith Mathiel. He lives in Darnassus which is quite a long way off, but I'm sure he'll be very grateful to learn what I've learned.Klockmort Spannerspan^28^Alliance^Warrior^Furen Longbeard^Klockmort Spannerspan^Klockmort Spannerspan^Fire Hardened Mail^^Bring Furen's Notes to Klockmort Spannerspan.^I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and need someone to take them to Klockmort Spannerspan. He's a gnomish blacksmith in Ironforge and when he learns what I've learned... I bet he'll pull off his own beard in excitement.Burning Blood^28^Alliance^Warrior^Grimand Elmore^Grimand Elmore^Grimand Elmore^^Grimand's Armor^Bring 20 vials of Burning Blood and 1 Burning Rock to Grimand Elmore in Stormwind.^I hate to admit that Furen might have really found something. But to be sure I'll need to try his techniques on a new piece of armor. If you help me with the materials, <name>, then you can have the armor. To make this armor, I need samples of burning blood and a burning rock. The only place I know to get them is Duskwood. The Nightbane worgen based in the Roland's Doom mine have burning blood, and their leader Gutspill will have the rock. May fortune grant you speed, <name>.Water Pouch Bounty^44^All^Tanaris^Spigot Operator Luglunket^Spigot Operator Luglunket^^^Water Pouch Bounty^Bring 5 Wastewander Water Pouches to Spigot Operator Luglunket in Gadgetzan.^Greetings <name> - the name's Luglunket, and we've got an important job for you if you're up for it! Huzzah! Nothing would please me more as a seasoned spigot operator to take any Wastewander water pouches you might find out in the desert. That's our water anyway - the nomads have just stolen it is all! The Gadgetzan Water Company will offer you an official care package for every five you turn in. Most importantly though, you're helping Gadgetzan help itself!Iron Coral^29^Alliance^Warrior^Klockmort Spannerspan^Klockmort Spannerspan^Klockmort Spannerspan^^Klockmort's Creation^Bring 20 loads of Searing Coral to Klockmort Spannerspan in Ironforge.^I want to try Furen Longbeard's new techniques on my own piece of armor. And because you helped Furen and he helped me, you're welcome to the armor after I make it! To finish the piece, I need a special coral, searing coral. It grows in only one place--along the coast south of Menethil Harbor in the Wetlands. Bring me enough searing coral and I'll get right to work on the armor. And hurry, <name>. I'm so eager to get started it's making my toes twist!Sunscorched Shells^30^Alliance^Warrior^Mathiel^Mathiel^Mathiel^^Mathiel's Armor^Bring 20 Sunscorched Shells to Mathiel in Darnassus.^My colleague, Furen Longbeard, made a discovery which I am eager to test. I wish to try it on a new armor that I am researching, for I believe Furen's techniques will produce superior results. Will you help me? If you gather what I need to make the armor, then I will make an extra piece for you. I need the sunscorched egg shells of the Highperch Wyverns who dwell at Highperch, in Thousand Needles. Search for the shells below their nests, and return to me when you have a sufficient amount.Cyclonian^40^All^Warrior^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^The Windwatcher^^^Bring the items on Bath'rah's Parchment to Bath'rah the Windwatcher in Alterac.^I have spent ages watching this site. I watch, so that one day I might see the great Cyclonian fall. But I have not yet found a champion to defeat the wind lord. Perhaps you are that champion. Prove it to me. Gather the items I need to summon Cyclonian, and I will know you are a great warrior. Perhaps then you can defeat him and gain his whirlwind heart. If so, then I will infuse the heart's power in a weapon, and I will give that weapon to you. Here is a parchment with the items I need.The Summoning^40^All^Warrior^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^The Windwatcher^^Whirlwind Weapon^Bring the Whirlwind Heart to Bath'rah Windwatcher.^I am ready to perform the ritual to summon Cyclonian. When he is summoned, you must defeat him and take his whirlwind heart. This I will use to instill a weapon with Cyclonian's power. <name>, are you ready to face the wind lord?The Slaughtered Lamb^10^Alliance^Warlock^Lago Blackwrench^Gakin the Darkbinder^^^^Report to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.^Hmph. Times past, all warlocks in Khaz Modan were trained under the auspices of the masters of Gnomeregan, but now that we've all been forced to relocate into this rat's hole in Ironforge, and Magni's decided to keep a careful watch on us, we're forced to send our novices to Stormwind for training. Luckily, Gakin's no slouch, so you'll still learn what you need to know, but it burns my blood! Anyways, you'll find Gakin in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb in Stormwind.Devourer of Souls^20^Alliance^Warlock^Gakin the Darkbinder^Takar the Seer^Gakin's Summons^^^Speak with Takar the Seer in the Barrens.^A succubus is a devourer of souls, destroyer of hearts, and dominator of minds. It knows nothing but evil. This will be the creature you will learn to summon and control, but it cannot be brought into our world without a stimulus. With a symbol of love as bait, it will surely answer your call. Then you can defeat it, and make it your tool. It will be hard to find something of this nature, though. You should speak with Takar the Seer. You will find him in the Barrens of Kalimdor near Camp Taurajo.Gakin's Summons^20^Alliance^Warlock^Lago Blackwrench^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin's Summons^^^Report to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.^<name>! Didn't expect to see you around these parts, but I was instructed to keep an eye out for you. It's past time you got some more training, so you should stop in to see Gakin the next time you're in Stormwind. He'll be waiting for you.The Islander^30^All^Warrior^Torm Ragetotem^Klannoc Macleod^The Islander^^^Speak with Klannoc Macleod.^Your renown as a warrior grows, <name>. Now it is time to pit yourself against your peers and see where you stand. There is an island off the coast of the Barrens, south of Ratchet. It is called Fray Island and it is a place where warriors meet. Meet, and fight. Speak with the chief warrior of Fray Island, Klannoc Macleod. If he finds you worthy, then Klannoc will lead you further down the warrior's path. To reach Fray Island, search for the sand bar shallows along the Merchant Coast.The Affray^30^All^Warrior^Klannoc Macleod^Klannoc Macleod^The Islander^^The Windwatcher^Kill Big Will, then speak to Klannoc Macleod on Fray Island.^If you want to learn from me, then you must first pass The Affray. It is a challenge we on Fray Island like to offer rising warriors who think they're tough, and if you can pass this test then I'll know you are. To begin, walk into the middle of that crowd yonder and step on the grate. That'll tell Twiggy Flathead you're ready, and he'll send challengers against you. Beat all the challengers and he'll call out Big Will. Kill Big Will, and return to me in the time we allow.Heartswood^20^Alliance^Warlock^Takar the Seer^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin's Summons^^^Retrieve the Heartswood from Ashenvale and bring it to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.^In preparation for your coming, I used my sight to look over the world and through the mists of time. I have found what it is you seek. In the War of the Ancients, two lovers fell together in battle. Where they took their last breaths, a tree known as the heartswood grew, a symbol of their undying love. That should be enough to tempt a succubus. You will find it in the ruins of Ordil'Aran in the northwestern part of the forest of Ashenvale.The Binding^20^Alliance^Warlock^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin the Darkbinder^Gakin's Summons^^^Using the Heartswood Core, summon and subdue a succubus, then return the Heartswood Core to Gakin the Darkbinder in the Slaughtered Lamb.^Using the heartswood core, you will be able to cast a spell at the summoning circle in the crypt below to open a portal for the succubus to pass through. Be careful, <name>, succubi have overrun even the strongest of minds. Once you have bested and returned it to the void, return to me and I will show you how to call and control it.The Orb of Soran'ruk^25^All^Warlock^Doan Karhan^Doan Karhan^^^^Find 3 Soran'ruk Fragments and 1 Large Soran'ruk Fragment and return them to Doan Karhan in the Barrens.^When demons of the Legion fall out of favor, their spirits are imprisoned within orbs and distributed to their mages and warlocks. Many were carried by their servants in Azeroth. Even fragmented, they still possess the powers of the demons trapped inside. The orb of Soran'ruk was broken into two pieces, one was further broken to be used by the acolytes of the Twilight's Hammer in Blackfathom Deeps. The other, larger piece, was possessed by a wizard in Shadowfang Keep. Find them and I can reform it.Tome of the Cabal^30^Alliance^Warlock^Strahad Farsan^Krom Stoutarm^Seeking Strahad^^^Speak with Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge.^It will take more than a simple summoning circle to bring forth a felhunter for you to challenge. My three acolytes and I will assist in creating the magic circles. You require a copy of the Tome of the Cabal, which has been lost to us for some time. It was written by the first group of warlocks to summon a felhunter unaided. Perhaps Krom Stoutarm can help you with this. An itinerant warlock these days, he spends his days hoarding ancient texts and skulking about the library in Ironforge.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^John Turner^Tiza Battleforge^The Tome of Divinity^^^Speak to Tiza Battleforge in Ironforge.^I'm going to see about making plans to return home soon. Hopefully, Stephanie is doing well back in Stormwind. I can't wait to see her again. Till next we meet, <class>.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Tiza Battleforge^Muiredon Battleforge^The Tome of Divinity^^^Take the Symbol of Life and speak to Muiredon Battleforge in Ironforge.^I want you to take this, <name>. It is called the Symbol of Life. You've proven charitable and patient, and now I want you to prove just how adept you've become in both combat, and power. My husband Muiredon returned recently from an encounter with some Dark Iron dwarves, and he barely escaped with his life--he's over there having his wounds healed by one of our priests. Take the Symbol and speak to him. If you can help him, then we will speak again soon. May the Light shine upon you.The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Stephanie Turner^Duthorian Rall^The Tome of Divinity^^^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^I'll take these to the children this very day. Please be safe, good <class>. It is not often <men/women> of your character show their faces in the city, but you've proven that the paladins here in Stormwind shall never turn their backs on those in need. Farewell.The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Duthorian Rall^Gazin Tenorm^The Tome of Divinity^^^Take the Symbol of Life to Gazin Tenorm in Stormwind.^Take this, <name>. It is called the Symbol of Life. You've proven charitable and patient, and now the time has come to see if you're powerful enough to focus one of the Light's greatest gifts. My friend Gazin returned recently from an encounter with some Defias in Elwynn near Heroes' Vigil--he barely escaped with his life. He's near the altar having his wounds healed by our priests. Take the Symbol and speak to him. If you can help him, then we will speak again soon. May you bask in the Light's glory.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Muiredon Battleforge^Narm Faulk^The Tome of Divinity^^^Take the Symbol of Life and resurrect Narm Faulk in Dun Morogh.^We was spyin' on some of the Dark Iron dwarves that've bunkered down south of Helm's Bed Lake. We knew they was up to no good, so Narm an' me thought we'd take a closer look--got ta see their leader given orders to some o' his men. Narm an' me took the chance to kill a few of 'em, but they proved tougher than we thought, an' more of 'em got the jump on us. Narm tol' me to run an' get support, so 'ere I am. Narm needs help, an' I'll not rest till he gets it. C'n ya help, <name>?The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Narm Faulk^Muiredon Battleforge^The Tome of Divinity^^^Retrieve a Dark Iron Script from the Dark Iron dwarves near Helm's Bed, and return to Muiredon Battleforge in Ironforge.^Before I fell in battle, Muiredon and I had almost defeated one of the Dark Iron spies near that small house. We witnessed their captain passing orders to them, and sought to kill him and take the orders. Some of the council in Ironforge do not yet believe the presence of Dark Iron dwarves exists in Dun Morogh. By attaining one of those scripts, we'll not only have proof of their movements, but possibly an idea of what they're planning. Get one of those scripts and take it back to Muiredon, <name>.The Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Muiredon Battleforge^Tiza Battleforge^The Tome of Divinity^^^Speak to Tiza Battleforge in Ironforge.^I c'n see me wife's o'er there beamin' wit pride already. Ya better get yer tuchus o'er there pronto. I be thinkin' she'd have some words wit ya. Light be witcha, mighty <class>. I'll be lookin' fer ya on the battlefield against the Scourge and dem Dark Irons when the time comes.The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Gazin Tenorm^Henze Faulk^The Tome of Divinity^^^Take the Symbol of Life and resurrect Henze Faulk in Elwynn.^Henze and I had made it to Heroes' Vigil, an island in the middle of Stone Cairn Lake in northeastern Elwynn. We'd heard the Defias had infiltrated our borders and we wanted proof to take to the king's advisors. We caught sight of a couple of the scum going over some documents, and we attacked. Unfortunately, we were quickly overwhelmed by more of the mages. Henze held them off for me while I escaped... the daft fool, going and being brave. He's out there now, Henze is. Can you help us, <name>?The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Henze Faulk^Gazin Tenorm^The Tome of Divinity^^^Retrieve a Defias Script from the Defias Rogue Wizards in Elwynn, and return to Gazin Tenorm in Stormwind.^We'll have time to talk more about the Symbol at a later time. What's important now is to get those papers we saw the Defias going over. If we can get our hands on them, we'll be able to prove the Defias have infiltrated Elwynn and hopefully gain some insight into what their plans are. I'm in no shape for battle as of now, <name>. Do you think you're strong enough to get those papers from the Defias here on the island? If you're able to get them, bring them back to Gazin and let him know I'm all right.The Tome of Divinity^12^Human^Paladin^Gazin Tenorm^Duthorian Rall^The Tome of Divinity^^^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^I'll take the script to the King's advisors after Duthorian's taken a look at them, but in the meantime, you should go speak to Duthorian now. He'll be wanting to pat you on the back for sure! Thank you again, <name>. I hope we meet again. You're surely an ally I'm proud to call friend.The Windwatcher^30^All^Warrior^Klannoc Macleod^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^The Windwatcher^The Affray^^Speak with Bath'rah the Windwatcher.^Now that you've learned your berserker's stance, you'll want a nice weapon to use it with. Talk to Bath'rah the Windwatcher, a troll hermit who lives between the Alterac Mountains and the Western Plaguelands. He is a skilled weapon maker and a powerful shaman. To find Bath'rah, go to the river that flows along Tarren Mill's eastern flank. Follow it north--Bath'rah is camped near ruins that rest along the river's eastern bank.The Binding^30^All^Warlock^Strahad Farsan^Strahad Farsan^Seeking Strahad^^^Using the Tome of the Cabal, summon and subdue a felhunter, then return the Tome of the Cabal to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.^If you are sufficiently prepared, then we should begin. Let me explain the process to you. I will begin by creating the basic summoning circle. When that is finished, my acolytes will use the rods of channeling to create the greater circle. Once that is done, read the incantation from the Tome of the Cabal, and the felhunter will be pulled forth. Be careful, <name>. A felhunter is a powerful foe, and I'd like to see you keep your head on your shoulders.Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe^31^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Bring Robes of the Arcana to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^The first item I will aid you in creating is a robe. You will gather the items for me, and we will put them together. Afterwards, assuming you succeed, you will have the first of many items that will make you more powerful and aid you in your struggles. To start, you must have crafted Robes of Arcana. A tailor can make this for you, or perhaps you can purchase one from someone else--I'd be most impressed if you could make it yourself--but regardless, bring me the robes, and we shall go from there.Seeking Strahad^30^Alliance^Warlock^Lago Blackwrench^Strahad Farsan^Seeking Strahad^^^Speak with Strahad Farsan in the Barrens.^It is time you learned the felhunter summoning, <name>. I do not have the reagents and items necessary to teach you here, so you will have to seek out another, Strahad Farsan, another of our inner circle. He makes his residence in the goblin port of Ratchet. I will send word ahead of you to inform him of your coming.Fragments of the Orb of Orahil^40^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Tabetha^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^^Speak to Menara's acolytes inside the tower above Ratchet and choose one of their paths to follow.^Good, then we shall begin. The first thing you must do is speak to my acolytes inside. Choose one of their paths to follow--they will explain more. Second, you must travel to Desolace and find an Infernal Orb from one of the warlocks of Mannoroc Coven. It is that orb that you will cleanse with the help of a mage named Tabetha deep in southern Dustwallow Marsh. She will aid you because of our history together. Again, do not come back until you have done both things I've asked.Tome of the Cabal^30^Horde^Warlock^Strahad Farsan^Jorah Annison^Tome of the Cabal^^^Speak with Jorah Annison in the Undercity.^It will take more than a simple summoning circle to bring forth a felhunter for you to challenge. My three acolytes and I will assist in creating the magic circles. You require a copy of the Tome of the Cabal, which has been lost to us for some time. It was written by the first group of warlocks to summon a felhunter unaided. Perhaps Jorah Annison can help you with this. He's employed as a cartographer in the Undercity these days, but still knows more of ancient texts than any I know.Tome of the Cabal^30^Alliance^Warlock^Krom Stoutarm^Krom Stoutarm^Seeking Strahad^^^Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge.^It was lost, but there's some idea as to where it might be found. There was only one copy ever made and it was vandalized at some point, a large portion of it ripped from the binding. Rumor has it that it somehow passed into the hands of the centaur of Thousand Needles. The rest was lost off the coast west of Southshore, where it was to be transported to Menethil Harbor by boat. It never arrived. In exchange for this knowledge, all I ask is that if you find it, bring it to me to see.Tome of the Cabal^30^Horde^Warlock^Jorah Annison^Jorah Annison^Tome of the Cabal^^^Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Jorah Annison in the Undercity.^Ah! I see that you are a warlock of similar tastes to mine. Indeed, acquiring the Tome of the Cabal is a worthy aspiration. Did you know that it was once held within the walls of Lordaeron? It was vandalized though, almost half its pages removed. Who would commit such a heinous act? That half is lost, though rumor says that it fell into the hands of the centaur of the Thousand Needles. The rest of the text was to be transferred to Ironforge, but was lost in transit on the coast west of Southshore.Tome of the Cabal^30^Alliance^Warlock^Krom Stoutarm^Strahad Farsan^Seeking Strahad^^The Binding^Bring the Reconstructed Tome and 3 Rods of Channeling to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.^Well, ah, it's hard to let it go. But you found it, and you have more important things to do with it, of course. Just, please, be sure to mention to Strahad that I wanted a copy. While you were out, he sent a message for you. He wanted me to tell you that for his acolytes to assist with the summoning, you'll have to acquire three rods of channeling. He might not know where to find them, but I do! They were last used by the orcs of the Dragonmaw clan in the Wetlands. I'd check their spellcasters!Tome of the Cabal^30^Horde^Warlock^Jorah Annison^Strahad Farsan^Tome of the Cabal^^The Binding^Bring the Reconstructed Tome and 3 Rods of Channeling to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.^This is one of the most interesting texts I have perused in the last few years. The selection here is sparse--mostly books on geography--and I have already read them all. I should hope that Strahad would send me a copy of this tome when he has the chance. Speaking of him, he sent word to me while you were away. For your task, you must obtain three rods of channeling. For allowing me to look at this text, I will share a secret: You can find the rods on orcs of the Dragonmaw Clan in the Wetlands.The Test of Righteousness^22^Alliance^Paladin^Jordan Stilwell^Jordan Stilwell^The Tome of Valor^^^Wait for Jordan Stilwell to finish forging a weapon for you.^Why don't we go over to the forge and get started on this? I've been preparing for your arrival for some time, so it shouldn't take long at all. When we're done, you'll be far more prepared to defend the Light than you have been, this much I swear. I'll be somewhat honest, <name>, seeing the results of your exploits makes me somewhat envious. But knowing that I can contribute to your adventures in my own significant way does bring me some joy.Speak with Dillinger^10^Horde^Warrior^Austil de Mon^Deathguard Dillinger^Speak with Dillinger^^Path of Defense^Speak with Deathguard Dillinger in Brill.^I was told Deathguard Dillinger has a job for someone like you. If you're willing to show your value to the Dark Lady's forces, then report to Dillinger immediately. Deathguard Dillinger's post is on the west end of Brill, near the graveyard.Ulag the Cleaver^10^Horde^Warrior^Deathguard Dillinger^Deathguard Dillinger^Speak with Dillinger^^^Kill Ulag the Cleaver, then speak with Deathguard Dillinger.^When the Scourge swept through Tirisfal Glades, we captured one to study. He had a free mind, and called himself Ulag the Cleaver. But, although his will was free, he was still enthralled by the Lich King. We hoped to find a way to break the king's control over Ulag, but we failed. Now, finally, it is time to free him. Free him, and kill him. Activate the skull stone trigger near the mausoleum to the north. This will lift the magical seal that binds him. Then... be ready, <name>.Speak with Coleman^10^Horde^Warrior^Deathguard Dillinger^Coleman Farthing^Speak with Dillinger^^^Speak with Coleman Farthing.^You have proven your value to the Dark Lady, now perhaps you can prove yourself to one of her subjects. Coleman Farthing awaits a warrior who is willing to be his instrument of revenge against the Forsaken's enemies. You will find him in the Gallow's End Tavern in eastern Brill.Agamand Heirlooms^11^Horde^Warrior^Coleman Farthing^Coleman Farthing^Speak with Dillinger^^Heirloom Weapon^Bring Coleman Farthing the Agamand Family Axe, the Agamand Family Sword, the Agamand Family Mace and the Agamand Family dagger.^The Agamand family were my employers in life, and they were the cause of my death! It is fitting that the Agamands are now mindless minions of the Lich King. Now I would have their last vestiges of honor. Go into their family crypt and rob them of their family heirlooms: a sword, an axe, a dagger and a mace. Bring them to me! The Agamand family crypt is at the north end of the Agamand mills, protected by lurking Scourge and dead Agamands.Speak with Ruga^20^Horde^Warrior^Sorek^Ruga Ragetotem^Speak with Ruga^^^Speak with Ruga Ragetotem.^You are a warrior of skill and growing renown. Perhaps you are ready for Ruga Ragetotem's trial? If so, then find Ruga in Camp Taurajo in the Barrens. He awaits those warriors who answer his call.Trial at the Field of Giants^20^Horde^Warrior^Ruga Ragetotem^Ruga Ragetotem^Speak with Ruga^^^Bring 5 twitching antennae to Ruga Ragetotem at Camp Taurajo^To pass this trial, you must travel south to the Field of Giants. There you will find a host of crawling, insect creatures. They are new to the Barrens and I do not like what they herald. Bring me their still-twitching antennae, and waste no time, <name>, for harvested antennae will not twitch for long. Bring me the antennae in the time allowed, and you will pass the trial.Speak with Thun'grim^20^Horde^Warrior^Ruga Ragetotem^Thun'grim Firegaze^Speak with Ruga^^^Speak with Thun'grim Firegaze in the Barrens.^Thun'grim Firegaze, an orc blacksmith of renown, has heard of your continued deeds of valor in service of the Horde. He would like to fashion for you a suit of armor, and bids you speak with him immediately. Thun'grim is camped east of the Crossroads in the Barrens.Brutal Armor^30^Horde^Warrior^Thun'grim Firegaze^Thun'grim Firegaze^Speak with Ruga^^Ula'elek and the Brutal Gauntlets, Orm Stonehoof and the Brutal Helm, Velora Nitely and the Brutal Legguards, Brutal Hauberk^Bring to Thun'grim Firegaze 15 Smoky Iron Ingots, 10 Powdered Azurite, 10 Iron Bars and a Vial of Phlogiston.^I have heard tales of your strength and valor, and wish to make for you a suit of armor, a companion to aid you as tales of your great deeds grow. But the fashioning of this armor will be a quest unto itself, <name>. I will need your help, and the help of other smiths of the Horde. Here, take this scroll. I spent many nights, struggling with near-blind eyes, writing that which I need for the armor. Bring me the items on this scroll and I will create for you the first piece of the suit.Ula'elek and the Brutal Gauntlets^30^Horde^Warrior^Thun'grim Firegaze^Ula'elek^Ula'elek and the Brutal Gauntlets^Brutal Armor^^Speak with Ula'elek in Durotar.^The troll smith Ula'elek will craft for you the brutal gauntlets. He dwells in Durotar, in Sen'jin Village with his Darkspear brethren, and he awaits your coming.Orm Stonehoof and the Brutal Helm^30^Horde^Warrior^Thun'grim Firegaze^Orm Stonehoof^Orm Stonehoof and the Brutal Helm^Brutal Armor^^Speak with Orm Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^Orm Stonehoof is respected greatly for his skill. He will make for you the brutal helm. Seek him out in Thunder Bluff, near the pool by the city's great, central totem.Velora Nitely and the Brutal Legguards^30^Horde^Warrior^Thun'grim Firegaze^Velora Nitely^Velora Nitely and the Brutal Legguards^Brutal Armor^^Speak with Velora Nitely in the Undercity.^It is said that, before her death, Velora Nitely was one of the finest armorsmiths in Lordaeron. Death, it seems, has not decreased her talents. Speak with Velora--she will make your brutal legguards. Velora plies her trade in the Undercity of Lordaeron, in the trade quarter.Satyr Hooves^30^Horde^Warrior^Ula'elek^Ula'elek^Ula'elek and the Brutal Gauntlets^^Brutal Gauntlets^Bring 7 Uncloven Satyr Hooves to Ula'elek at Sen'jin Village in Durotar.^I can make you a pair of brutal gauntlets, and great magic will they hold. But first, you must collect this magic and bring it to me. The satyrs dwell in northeastern Ashenvale because of the forest's power. They feed off its purity, leeching and corrupting. You can tell which satyrs have drawn the most of Ashenvale's magic by their swollen, uncloven hooves. These hooves hold great power. I will need them for your gauntlets' crafting.Chimaeric Horn^30^Horde^Warrior^Orm Stonehoof^Orm Stonehoof^Orm Stonehoof and the Brutal Helm^^Brutal Helm^Bring a Galvanized Horn to Orm Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^I will make you the helm, but you must show me you are worthy of it. Nestled in the southwestern reaches of the Stonetalon Mountains lies the Charred Vale. It was once a verdant place, but is now defiled and ashen, and what creatures remain there are mad with pain and despair. That place is where I send you, <name>. You must go to the Charred Vale and find a chimaera matriarch. Slay her, free her of her misery. Bring me her galvanized horn as proof, and I shall make for you the helm.Dragonmaw Shinbones^30^Horde^Warrior^Velora Nitely^Velora Nitely^Velora Nitely and the Brutal Legguards^^Brutal Legguards^Bring 8 Sturdy Dragonmaw Shinbones to Velora Nitely in the Undercity.^To make the brutal leg guards, I need a brace of sturdy shinbones. The Dragonmaw orcs of the Wetlands have nice, thick shinbones. I'll need theirs. But they must be sturdy. Be sure to test the shinbones as you collect them. If you can break them with your bare hands, then they won't be sturdy enough to work with.The Shattered Hand^13^Horde^Rogue^Therzok^Therzok^Therzok^^^Steal Tazan's key, then use it to open his Satchel and deliver its contents to Therzok in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar.^I'll leave it to you to get Tazan's satchel open, and return to me with its contents. The locking mechanism is complex, so it would probably be easiest if you obtained the key. As you didn't find it on Tazan's body, I can only assume that he left the key in the care of another... Ah, yes, that's right. He had an assistant named Gamon. A drunkard, you'll most likely find him at the tavern. Perhaps you could quietly relieve him of the key.Therzok^10^Horde^Rogue^Kaplak^Therzok^Therzok^^The Shattered Hand^Speak with Therzok in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar.^Lower your voice, <name>. Yeah, I know your name. Was told to keep an eye out for an orc by your description. From what we've heard about you, you can handle yourself in combat, and aren't opposed to a little sneakery from time to time. Am I right? Anyways, you should go see Therzok in Orgrimmar. He's got an offer for you to hear.Speak with Jennea^10^Alliance^Mage^Zaldimar Wefhellt^Jennea Cannon^Speak with Jennea^^Mirror Lake^Speak with Jennea Cannon in Stormwind.^We mages have a task that needs doing. One that is vital to the safety of Stormwind and Elwynn forest. Jennea Cannon has the details. She studies in the wizard's sanctum, in the mage district of Stormwind. You should make your way to her with haste.Mirror Lake^10^Human^Mage^Jennea Cannon^Jennea Cannon^Speak with Jennea^^^Bring a Mirror Lake sample to Jennea Cannon in Stormwind.^This world has been victim to massive mystic struggles, which tore magic currents from once stable channels. We struggle to determine the effects these changes have caused, and some of us fear the worst! But I will reveal more of this later. Right now, we need you to gather information. Here, take this flask. Go to the base of the waterfall at Mirror Lake, southwest of the Stormwind gates, and retrieve a sample of the water there. Return it to me so that I might test it for magical taints.Speak with Bink^10^Alliance^Mage^Magis Sparkmantle^Bink^Speak with Bink^^Mirror Lake^Speak with Bink in Ironforge.^<name>! Bink, my gnome colleague in Ironforge, sends word. She has a task that needs doing and won't rely on anyone but a mage to do it! Are you that mage, <name>? If so, then speak with Bink. She spends her time in the Hall of Mysteries in the Mystic Ward of Ironforge.Mage-tastic Gizmonitor^10^Alliance^Mage^Bink^Bink^Speak with Bink^^^Bring Bink her Mage-tastic Gizmonitor.^We mages do more than just waggle our fingers and make pretty sparks! We control magic, the base fabric of our world! And that takes great care, and resolve. And knowledge... so much knowledge! One of my devices, the mage-tastic gizmonitor, collects and stores that knowledge in huge amounts! But it's lost! When we fled our home of Gnomeregan, I left it in a chest in one of our huts outside the city, and now the place is crawling with leper gnomes! Please, <name>, retrieve my gizmonitor!Speak with Anastasia^10^Horde^Mage^Cain Firesong^Anastasia Hartwell^Speak with Anastasia^^The Balnir Farmstead^Speak with Anastasia Hartwell.^<name>, Anastasia Hartwell has a task for someone of your talents. Speak with her in the Magic Quarter of the Undercity, and prepare yourself for your first task for the mages of the Forsaken.The Balnir Farmstead^10^Horde^Mage^Anastasia Hartwell^Anastasia Hartwell^Speak with Anastasia^^^Bring Balnir Snapdragons to Anastasia Hartwell in the Mage Quarter of the Undercity.^The Plaguelands to the east are an aberration. Devised by the Lich King, they spread their magic into the soil, corrupting and killing all that live. Although there is a certain charm to the destructive forces of the plague, we, the mages of the Forsaken, believe it is unruly and must be curtailed. But first, we must measure how far it has spread into Tirisfal. Go to the Balnir Farmstead in eastern Tirisfal. In the garden are flowers--snapdragons. Gather these and return.Speak with Un'thuwa^10^Horde^Mage^Uthel'nay^Un'Thuwa^Speak with Un'thuwa^^The Balnir Farmstead^Speak with Un'thuwa.^Un'thuwa, tribal mage of Sen'jin Village, detects a disturbance in the magic currents of Durotar and asks for aid. Speak with Un'thuwa and do what you can to help him. Do this, and in time further secrets will be revealed to you.Ju-Ju Heaps^10^Horde^Mage^Un'Thuwa^Un'Thuwa^Speak with Un'thuwa^^^Destroy 4 Ju-Ju Heaps, then return to Un'thuwa in Sen'jin Village.^The warlock Zalazane of the Echo Isles has disrupted the normal flow of magic in Durotar. He does this through tainted fetishes, ju-ju heaps, which he has placed among his huts on the main Echo Isle. These heaps corrupt our wildlife and give power to the warlocks and infernal creatures that lurk in the land's dark corners. You must destroy the ju-ju heaps, <name>, before the flow of magic is forever altered.Mennet Carkad^10^Horde^Rogue^Marion Call^Mennet Carkad^Mennet Carkad^^The Shattered Hand, The Deathstalkers^Speak with Mennet Carkad in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity.^<name>? Not quite what I was expecting, considering Carkad himself has taken an interest to you. Looks can be deceiving though, right? Either way, you should go see him as soon as possible. You wouldn't want to know what happened to the last few that chose to ignore his summons.The Befouled Element^27^Horde^Ashenvale^Befouled Water Globe^Mastok Wrilehiss^The Befouled Element^^^Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.^The slain elemental has produced an intensely glowing globe of water. The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting. It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe. It's not exactly common knowledge who might be interested in such a find; perhaps the person who originally sent you out to the lake, Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, might have an idea.Report to Jennea^15^Alliance^Mage^Zaldimar Wefhellt^Jennea Cannon^Report to Jennea^^^Speak with Jennea Cannon in Stormwind.^Your knowledge of the craft grows, young <name>. Are you now ready to begin your true lessons? Are you ready to take your place in the secret war we wage? If so, then speak with Jennea Cannon, in the wizard's sanctum in the mage district of Stormwind. She has a task for you which will open your first window into the invisible world.Investigate the Blue Recluse^16^Alliance^Mage^Jennea Cannon^Jennea Cannon^Report to Jennea^^^Obtain a Cantation of Manifestation and a Chest of Containment coffers from behind Jennea Cannon. Bring 3 Filled Containment Coffers to Jennea at the Wizard's Sanctum.^A disturbance has been reported at the Blue Recluse tavern in the Mage Quarter. Strange, invisible creatures now wander the tavern, and I fear a mana rift has formed there. I want you to investigate the tavern and capture those creatures. Use the cantation of manifestation in the tavern to make the creatures visible, subdue them then use a containment coffer to capture them. When you have enough, return to me with your filled coffers, your empty coffers and the cantation.Gathering Materials^15^Alliance^Mage^Jennea Cannon^Wynne Larson^Report to Jennea^^Manaweave Robe^Bring 10 Linen Cloth and the 6 Charged Rift Gems to Wynne Larson in Stormwind.^You have served your fellow mages well, and now it is time to don your wizard's robe. Wynne Larson can make your robe, but you must bring her the needed materials The robe will be made of linen which is easy to find, but you must also gain charged rift gems, and the only known location of the gems is in the Silver Stream Mine of Loch Modan, left in crates by the dwarven miners' league. Gather the linen and the gems and bring them to Wynne Larson at the Larson Clothiers in the Mage District.Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic^28^Alliance^Mage^High Sorcerer Andromath^High Sorcerer Andromath^High Sorcerer Andromath^^^Bring Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic to High Sorcerer Andromath in Stormwind.^Long ago, three mages studied in this tower until one fell to the dark arts. He was urged to turn away from that evil magic, but he could not resist. And so he was banished. The fallen mage's new domain is the tower of Ilgalar in Redridge, and he took with him a powerful book--Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic. We, the mages of Stormwind, would have that book returned. Enter the tower of Ilgalar, find the tome in his library, and bring it to me.High Sorcerer Andromath^26^Alliance^Mage^Bink^High Sorcerer Andromath^High Sorcerer Andromath^^^Speak with High Sorcerer Andromath.^High Sorcerer Andromath wishes to speak with you, <name>. He is at the top of the wizard's sanctum, in the mage's district of Stormwind. It would be wise to speak with him, for Andromath is one of the most powerful mages not locked away in Dalaran. Council with him is high council indeed.Pristine Spider Silk^26^Alliance^Mage^High Sorcerer Andromath^Wynne Larson^High Sorcerer Andromath^^Astral Knot Garment^Bring 8 Pristine Spider Silk to Wynne Larson in Stormwind.^Your service has been unwavering, <name>. I think, perhaps, it is time you had a finer garment, one more suiting your station as an adept mage. If you gather the needed materials, then we will arrange the robe made. You must enter Duskwood and hunt carrion recluse spiders. Extract their silk, but only the finest, most pristine silk will do. When you have enough, take it to Wynne Larson, here in the mage district at the Larson Clothiers. She will craft your robe.Speak with Deino^26^Horde^Mage^Anastasia Hartwell^Deino^Speak with Deino^^^Speak with Deino.^The troll mage Deino has need of your assistance, <name>. She resides in Orgrimmar, in the Darkbriar Lodge.Waters of Xavian^26^Horde^Mage^Deino^Deino^Speak with Deino^^^Bring the Xavian Water Sample to Deino in Orgrimmar.^The fabled city of Xavian lies nestled deep within eastern Ashenvale, and tales of its ancient knowledge are well known among the learned. It is said that the waters of Xavian hold vast magical powers. I would have a sample of those waters, from their source. Take this flask and go to Xavian. Gather water from the bottom of its highest waterfall, and return to me. And use care as you move through that ancient city--satyrs now hold the ruins and do not like mages prying into their affairs.Laughing Sisters^26^Horde^Mage^Deino^Kil'hala^Speak with Deino^^Nether-lace Garment^Bring 12 Laughing Sister's Hairs to Kil'hala at the Crossroads.^For your services, I have arranged for the creation of your new robes, provided you can gather the needed materials... For these robes, you must return to Ashenvale for the locks of hair from laughing sisters--dryads who gather near the Raynewood Retreat. When you have their hair, bring it to Kil'hala, a troll tailor at the Crossroads in the Barrens. He will be expecting you, and will fashion your robes.Journey to the Marsh^38^All^Mage^Jennea Cannon^Tabetha^^^Hidden Secrets^Speak with Tabetha.^Now it is time for you to earn your mage's wand. To begin this quest, speak with the human hermit Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh. You will find her shack deep in the marsh, west of Theramore. Speak with her, for her knowledge is vast. You will find Tabetha's cottage west of Theramore, and just north of the Stonemaul Ruins.Items of Power^40^All^Mage^Tabetha^Tabetha^^^^Bring 1 Jade and the Bolt Charged Bramble to Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.^The building of a mage's wand is not easy. Rare substances are required, and a vessel must be made that can store great quantities of magical energy. You must gather these things and bring them to me. I have written onto this parchment that which you need, and instructions on how to get it. Bring me exactly what is on this list, and follow my written directions to the letter, for if you do not then when we make your wand things might go... badly.Hidden Secrets^38^All^Mage^Tabetha^Magus Tirth^Hidden Secrets^Journey to the Marsh^^Speak with Magus Tirth in the Shimmering Flats.^To make your wand, there are key passages in a certain book that I must read. The book is called Rituals of Power, written by the Magus Tirth. I do not have a copy of his book, and none of the world's great libraries possess it. So you must speak with Tirth and gain it from him. Good luck. Tirth used to be a great mage and scholar, but now he spends his time at the gnome and goblin races in the Shimmering Flats, drinking and gambling.Get the Scoop^30^All^Mage^Magus Tirth^Magus Tirth^Hidden Secrets^^^Find the phrase to Tirth's strongbox, then return to Tirth.^I can help you with the book, but first you have to help me! The tome you seek is in my magically locked strongbox. To open it a special phrase must be uttered, and I can't remember the phrase! Normally my assistant helps me remember these things but he's nowhere to be found. If you want my book, then find my apprentice! Ask around the race track--if you're lucky then someone has seen him. Either drag him back here, or at least get my magic phrase from him so we can open my box!Rituals of Power^40^All^Mage^Magus Tirth^Tabetha^Hidden Secrets^^Mage's Wand^Bring the book Rituals of Power to Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.^Hm... now that I think about it, I don't have my book! You see, I had some gambling debts and to pay them off I sold the last copy of Rituals of Power to a member of the clergy.... A member of the Scarlet Brotherhood. He must have taken it to their library in the Scarlet Monastery in Tirisfal Glades! If you want that book, then you'll have to go to the monastery to find it. And sorry about all the trouble. I'm not myself these days...Mage's Wand^40^All^Mage^Tabetha^Tabetha^^Rituals of Power^^Speak with Tabetha after her ritual.^I'll go make the wands now.Return to the Marsh^40^All^Mage^Anastasia Hartwell^Tabetha^Return to the Marsh^^^Speak with Tabetha.^It is time, <name>, for you to speak with Tabetha... the hermit of Dustwallow Marsh. She will instruct you on the creation of a powerful mage's implement. Tabetha's shack lies deep in Dustwallow Marsh, west of Theramore.The Infernal Orb^40^All^Mage^Tabetha^Tabetha^Return to the Marsh^^^Bring an Infernal Orb to Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.^The first step is to acquire an orb with power. The warlocks of the Burning Blade have nice, high quality orbs... it's too bad they've bound demons into them! But we can fix that, yes we can. Go to Desolace and snatch an infernal orb from a Burning Blade summoner. You'll find summoners at the Mannoroc Coven. When you have the orb, return to me.The Exorcism^40^All^Mage^Tabetha^Tabetha^Return to the Marsh^^^Kill the Demon of the Orb, then speak with Tabetha.^Now that we have a summoner's orb, we must exorcise the demon within it. I can do that. That's the easy part. You're the one who has the hard job. You're the one who has to kill the demon once it's out. And you'll have to be quick. If you take too long then he'll jump back in the orb and we'll have to start over! So get yourself ready. Prepare your strongest spells and keep your potions handy, and go get a friend if you have one. Because this isn't going to be pretty.Power in Uldaman^40^All^Mage^Tabetha^Tabetha^Return to the Marsh^^^Retrieve an Obsidian Power Source and bring it to Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.^Now that the demon has been removed, we must gain a power source. Unfortunately, the best power sources are usually the oldest and the hardest to get. It's neat how fate likes to take a bite out of you sometimes, isn't it? So you're going to need to go to Uldaman and defeat the obsidian sentinel there. He's big, he's tough, and his power source packs a punch! I wish you the best of luck, <name>. And if you don't get lucky then, well... it was nice knowing you.Mana Surges^40^All^Mage^Tabetha^Tabetha^Return to the Marsh^^Celestial Power^Kill 12 Mana Surges in the allowed time limit.^We are almost finished, but this last step is the most perilous, <name>. I have the empty summoner's orb and am ready to empower it. We will do this by harnessing the energy of a mana rift. I'll cast a spell that will temporarily open a rift, from which creatures, mana surges, will pour out. You must defeat the mana surges and their power will be released, which I will then collect. Kill enough mana surges before the rift closes and I will place all their collected energy in your orb.Report to Anastasia^15^Horde^Mage^Cain Firesong^Anastasia Hartwell^Report to Anastasia^^^Speak with Anastasia Hartwell.^The mages of the Undercity have noted a magical disturbance within the city, and have sent word for mages of the Horde to investigate. Anastasia Hartwell can tell you more. Speak with her in the Magic Quarter in the Undercity.Investigate the Alchemist Shop^16^Horde^Mage^Anastasia Hartwell^Anastasia Hartwell^Report to Anastasia^^^Obtain a Cantation of Manifestation and a Chest of Containment Coffers from behind Anastasia Hartwell. Bring 3 Filled Containment Coffers, the Chest of Containment Coffers and the Cantation of Manifestation to Anastasia in the Undercity.^Algernon's alchemist shop in the Apothecarium is the locus of a strange disturbance. Invisible creatures, made solely of magic, wander the shop--there must be a reason, and we must find it! Investigate the disturbance and capture those creatures. Take a chest of coffers and a scroll from behind me. Use the scroll at the shop to make the creatures visible, subdue them with your spells, then throw down a coffer to capture them. Return with the filled coffers, the empty coffers and the cantation.Gathering Materials^15^Horde^Mage^Anastasia Hartwell^Josef Gregorian^Report to Anastasia^^Spellfire Robes^Bring 10 Linen Cloth and 6 Dalaran Mana Gems to Josef Gregorian.^It is time for you to don your first mage's robes, <name>. They are a sign of your station, and a testament to your worth. To gain the robes, you must gather the mana gems from the Dalaran mages of Silverpine. Their beliefs are similar to ours and so killing them is somewhat distasteful, but if they lack the strength to resist us, then they do not deserve their lives. Bring the gems and a supply of linen to Josef Gregorian at the Magic Quarter's tailor shop.The Shattered Hand^13^Horde^Rogue^Therzok^Therzok^Therzok^^^Kill Tazan and bring his Satchel to Therzok in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar.^The Warchief is too subtle in his methods. He is cautious to unleash the might of the Horde. Once we were stronger, mighty conquerors all. That pride we must regain, and the Shattered Hand will do so. We build strength from the shadows and strike at the exposed, secretly laying our enemies low. A task you must complete for me, to prove your worth. The troll Tazan trades with the pirates near Ratchet. He has information I must have. Kill him and bring me his satchel.Fenwick Thatros^16^Horde^Rogue^Mennet Carkad^Mennet Carkad^Fenwick Thatros^^^Kill Fenwick Thatros and bring his head back to Mennet Carkad in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity.^Lord Varimathras has just sent me a missive about a threat to the Forsaken that must be immediately removed. His name is Fenwick Thatros, one whom Lord Varimathras believes is a leader of the undead that have taken root in Silverpine Forest. Your name came to mind immediately, <name>. I have faith enough in your abilities that you will carry out this mission flawlessly. The latest reports from the Deathstalkers in Silverpine indicate that Thatros can be found near the decrepit dock on Lordamere.Tools of the Trade^20^Horde^Rogue^Mennet Carkad^Mennet Carkad^Fenwick Thatros^^^Find the Dalaran Status Report and return it to Mennet Carkad in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity.^The wizards of the Kirin Tor at Ambermill have stored away important documents pertaining to the current state of Dalaran. This we know from the admissions of one of our prisoners. Lord Varimathras has placed the duty of recovering them in the hands of the Deathstalkers. This task falls to you, <name>. You will need some equipment, however, and the knowledge of lockpicking. Speak with Estelle Gendry, our outfitter, and ask her for a set of tools before you set out.Tools of the Trade^16^All^Rogue^Mennet Carkad^Therzok^Rokar Bladeshadow^^^Return to Therzok in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar.^Here you go, <name>. These should serve you well. Crafted by my own hand, I swear you'll find none better. Do not bother to tell me your business, however. I have no interest in Therzok's schemes, I wish only to live out my retirement in peace. If you should ever need another set of tools, come back to me, and I will furnish you with a new set. But have a care with them!Bingles' Missing Supplies^15^Alliance^Loch Modan^Bingles Blastenheimer^Bingles Blastenheimer^Find Bingles^^^Find and return Bingles' supplies:^As if crashing into the Loch wasn't bad enough, troggs from the nearby island attacked me and stole my tools and special Blastenheimer Blastencapper explosives. With no gyrocopter and no explosives, the movement has no chance! Get my tools back and find my Blastencapper explosives, <name>. For Gnomeregan!Find Bingles^15^Alliance^Ironforge^Gnoarn^Bingles Blastenheimer^Find Bingles^^^Find Bingles Blastenheimer in Loch Modan.^We've lost contact with Bingles! He was sent on a reconnaissance mission over Gnomeregan and hasn't reported back in over a week. I just know he's gone and blown himself up. He was last seen flying over the Loch. Perhaps you can investigate, <name>.Underground Assault^20^Alliance^The Deadmines^Shoni the Shilent^Shoni the Shilent^Speak with Shoni^^^Retrieve the Gnoam Sprecklesprocket from the Deadmines and return it to Shoni the Shilent in Stormwind.^Gnomeregan has fallen under the control of those dastardly troggs! The situation is grave but perhaps you can help, <name>. Deep in the Deadmines is a functional goblin shredder. Find that shredder and bring back the intact power supply. With the shredder's power supply, we can give our gyrodrillmatic excavationators the power they need to break through the rocky underground borders of Gnomeregan, opening the way for a gnomish assault!Speak with Shoni^15^Alliance^Ironforge^Gnoarn^Shoni the Shilent^Speak with Shoni^^^Speak with Shoni the Shilent at the Dwarven District in Stormwind.^Perhaps... Perhaps you can help us in the battle for Gnomeregan. In Stormwind you will find the commander of our underground assault crew, Shoni the Shilent. Shoni needs assistance with her gyrodrillmatic excavationators. You will probably find her amongst the dwarves in Stormwind. Good luck, <name>.Gyromast's Revenge^20^All^Darkshore^Gelkak Gyromast^Gelkak Gyromast^Gyromast's Retrieval^^^Find Gelkak's First Mate, the Threshwackonator 4100, and lead it back to Gelkak.^Landlubber, ye needs to find me first mate. Take this'n key, puts it in his gulliver an' bring him back here to serve the Cap'n. Them murlocs an' their chief ain't gonna be too happy once me first mate gets a hold of em!Gyromast's Retrieval^20^All^Darkshore^Gelkak Gyromast^Gelkak Gyromast^Gyromast's Retrieval^^^Find and return the three pieces of Gelkak's Key to Gelkak Gyromast.^A pirate's life ain't an easy one, landlubber. It ain't all about plunderin' and booze! Alas, me ship be sunk just off shore thanks to them pesky Threshadons. What I be needin' is me first mate back in workin' order! When I washed up'n shore, the key for me first mate broke on the rocks and was pilfered by the beasties of Darkshore. Out of the corner of me eyes I saw some of them Ragin' Crawlers, Ferocious Foreststrider, and murloc rummaging through the wreckage....Plagued Lands^14^All^Darkshore^Tharnariun Treetender^Tharnariun Treetender^Plagued Lands^^^Capture a living Rabid Thistle Bear and bring it back to Tharnariun.^A sickness spreads across the Darkshore, gripping the minds and bodies of all it touches. The Thistle Bears have been hit the hardest by this plague. The once noble beasts are now an instrument of destruction - rabid and frenzied. I may have a cure for this ailment. Take this trap to the forest and lay it on the ground. Any Rabid Thistle Bear that crosses the light shall become docile for a short time. Once the bear is docile, it shall follow you. Lead it back here, <name>.Cleansing of the Infected^16^All^Darkshore^Tharnariun Treetender^Tharnariun Treetender^Plagued Lands^^Tharnariun's Hope^Cleanse the forest of 20 Rabid Thistle Bears and return to Tharnariun Treetender in Darkshore.^As I had feared, the cure does not work. It saddens me greatly to order the death of any of nature's beasts, but the sick and tainted thistle bears must be put down. Return to the forest and destroy 20 rabid thistle bears, <name>. It will most certainly not put a stop to the plague but it will slow down the damage the animals are doing to our forest and its inhabitants for a short time.Tharnariun's Hope^18^All^Darkshore^Tharnariun Treetender^Tharnariun Treetender^^Cleansing of the Infected^^Find and kill the Den Mother.^The survival of our people and lands comes at unfortunate costs, <name>. You have spilled the blood of nature's servants; many sick animals you have felled. The people of Auberdine are indebted to you, for the forest's pain is eased - even if only for a moment. I have one final task for you, but be warned, you will have to kill again. It is my hope that this will be the last time I call upon you, <name>. In a cave to the northeast, near Bashal'Aran, resides the Den Mother. Slay her.Rest and Relaxation^5^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Falkhaan Isenstrider^Innkeeper Farley^^^^Speak with Innkeeper Farley at the Lion's Pride Inn.^Every adventurer should rest when exhaustion sets in - and there is no finer place to get rest and relaxation than at the Lion's Pride Inn! My best friend, Innkeeper Farley, runs the Lion's Pride. If you tell him I sent you, he may give you the special discounted rates on food and drink. To find the Lion's Pride Inn, travel south along the road from here -- you can't miss it!Dolanaar Delivery^5^Alliance^Teldrassil^Porthannius^Innkeeper Keldamyr^^^^Bring the Dolanaar Delivery to Innkeeper Keldamyr.^Greetings, young <class>. Can you offer me aid? I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of Dolanaar. But I still have business with the druids of Shadowglen and cannot yet leave. Can you deliver this package for me? It must be sent to Innkeeper Keldamyr, at the Dolanaar inn. It lies along the road, to the south.Supplies to Tannok^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Hands Springsprocket^Tannok Frosthammer^^^^Deliver the Crate of Inn Supplies to Tannok Frosthammer in Kharanos.^Hey! You look like a hearty adventurer. If you're planning on braving the pass, do you suppose you could bring a package to the inn in Kharanos? You were planning on stopping at the inn, right? If you make it through the pass, you'll definitely want to take a breather there. Anyways, bring this to Tannok Frosthammer, the innkeeper's assistant. I can't get through the pass myself, and it'll be days until a Mountaineer escort comes through!A Peon's Burden^5^Horde^Durotar^Ukor^Innkeeper Grosk^^^^Bring Ukor's Burden to Innkeeper Grosk in Razor Hill.^Excuse me? Can you help me? I have a load of food here. I walked along the road and braved scorpids and spiders and worse! I brought the food to the Valley of Trials because I thought they needed it and I like to help out. But they don't need any food! Now I have to take it back to Razor Hill and I'm afraid of all the beasts along the way... Can you take it for me? I'm just a peon, but you're a hero. You fear nothing! Take it to Innkeeper Grosk at the Razor Hill inn. Thank you!Easy Strider Living^12^All^Cooking^Alanndarian Nightsong^Alanndarian Nightsong^^^^Bring back 5 Strider Meat to Alanndarian Nightsong in Auberdine.^Do you smell that delicious aroma? It's my secret recipe, <name>--fresh strider stew. Delicious! Perhaps you would be interested in learning the recipe? Before I teach you the recipe, you will need to prove that you can handle the beasts. Now, I don't expect you to go out and tame one and ride it back to me, but if you can kill a few and bring back some of their succulent meat, I may be persuaded to show you the ways of strider stew.The Shattered Necklace^41^Alliance^Badlands^Shattered Necklace^Talvash del Kissel^The Shattered Necklace^^^Search for the original creator of the shattered necklace to learn of its potential value.^You have found a tarnished necklace, though the tarnish belies intricate and magical craftsmanship. The necklace has been shattered, as its setting appears to be missing three gems. On the underside of the necklace is the faint imprint of the city seal for Ironforge. Below the seal are three tiny, engraved letters: "TdK". If there is anything to be gleaned from the necklace, you will need to learn about its origins. Perhaps the seal and the initials are a start...Lore for a Price^41^Alliance^Ironforge^Talvash del Kissel^Talvash del Kissel^The Shattered Necklace^^^Bring five silver bars to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge.^I am a jeweler of great renown here in Ironforge! Well, former renown anyway... I have fallen onto hard times due to the chicanery of a competitor! A bad reputation in this business spells financial disaster. As a result, I find myself without a copper to my good-though-currently-sullied name. I want you to get me five silver bars to finish an order I received - the first in what seems like an eternity. You get me those five silver bars, and I'll answer your questions on the necklace.Back to Uldaman^42^Alliance^Gnomeregan Exiles^Talvash del Kissel^Remains of a Paladin^The Shattered Necklace^^^Search for clues as to the current disposition of Talvash's necklace within Uldaman. The slain paladin he mentioned was the person who had it last.^A competitor of mine started a rumor that my necklace cursed the paladin. Needless to say, no one wants to buy cursed items from a jeweler. <name>, I'll make you a deal - find the gems and I'll reassemble the necklace, so long as you'll advertise that I do NOT make cursed items! Try looking for clues in Uldaman; maybe see if the paladin's body is down there, since he's the one who we know had it last! When you find the gems you should use this; it'll allow you to contact me here in Ironforge.Find the Gems^43^Alliance^Ironforge^Remains of a Paladin^Talvash del Kissel^The Shattered Necklace^^^Find the ruby, sapphire, and topaz that are scattered throughout Uldaman. Once acquired, contact Talvash del Kissel remotely by using the Phial of Scrying he previously gave you.^The paladin's journal has provided perhaps the only clues that Uldaman will yield as to the location of the necklace's gems. If the paladin's scribing remains accurate, then the Shadowforge dwarves and the troggs that vie for control of the dig site will need to be dealt with. Armed with this knowledge, the search for the gems begins in earnest. When all the gems have been acquired, Talvash in Ironforge should be notified via the Phial of Scrying as per his instructions.Uldaman Reagent Run^42^Horde^Badlands^Jarkal Mossmeld^Jarkal Mossmeld^Badlands Reagent Run^^Badlands Reagent Run II^Bring 12 Magenta Fungus Caps to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath.^I've heard about a newly discovered plant called the magenta fungus caps. They grow in clusters at the Uldaman dig site and can be found in the early tunnels and deep within the less-explored areas. I want to study their potential use in alchemy, and that's where you come in. Find the magenta cap clusters and bring me a dozen caps. Be warned, the clusters may spew out poison spores if jostled. Do this for me, and I'll whip up a batch of one of my famous restorative elixirs for you!Badlands Reagent Run II^44^Horde^Badlands^Jarkal Mossmeld^Jarkal Mossmeld^^Uldaman Reagent Run^^Use the empty thaumaturgy vessels on scorched guardian dragons found in the Badlands. Once you have them filled, bring them to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath.^You have been most helpful to me, <class>. I would reward you with the very recipe for the brew I gave you earlier... but I would ask of you a task that is quite dangerous. Hear my request. This lockbox contains three empty thaumaturgy vessels; they are imbued with an attunement aura that will drain the blood of a scorched guardian dragon. Using one on the beast will anger it greatly, so be warned. Once you have all three filled, bring them to me. Do this, and the recipe will be yours.Restoring the Necklace^44^Alliance^Ironforge^Talvash del Kissel^Talvash del Kissel^The Shattered Necklace^^Restoring the Necklace^Obtain a power source from the most powerful construct you can find in Uldaman, and deliver it to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge.^You are going to need to find some "oomph" for the necklace, and Uldaman is probably the best place for it, actually. I guess there are a lot of constructs running around in there, yeah? Well, take out the biggest, baddest construct in that place and grab its power source! I am pretty sure I can fuse that source into the necklace. Without that power source, fixing the necklace will be impossible. Come back to me here to Ironforge when you have it, and we'll get it all fixed up for you!Seek out SI: 7^10^Alliance^Rogue^Keryn Sylvius^Master Mathias Shaw^^^Snatch and Grab^Deliver Keryn Sylvius's package to Master Mathias Shaw at the Stormwind Barracks.^The badge? Oh, it's nothing, fish - nothing you could handle anyhow. By the looks of you, I'd say Mathias is likely to mistake you for the cheese delivery <boy/girl> instead of a proper rogue. Regardless, I've been assigned a job and I've made a promise to deliver on that job. Speaking of which, deliver this package to Mathias and he may give you a small task or two. Get cracking.Snatch and Grab^10^Alliance^Rogue^Master Mathias Shaw^Master Mathias Shaw^^^^Find the Defias Dockmaster and recover the Shipping Schedule for Master Mathias Shaw.^Our operatives in the field are reporting heavy Defias activity south of Goldshire. The reports indicate that the Defias have taken over Jerod's Landing and are now using it as a way to smuggle large quantities of contraband from Redridge to Westfall. I need you to infiltrate the dock house and get me that shipping schedule, <name>. You will probably find it buried deep in the pockets of the Dockmaster. ...and <name>, should you be discovered, SI:7 will disavow all knowledge of your existence.Road to Salvation^10^Alliance^Rogue^Hogral Bakkan^Hulfdan Blackbeard^Road to Salvation^^^Speak with Hulfdan Blackbeard in Ironforge.^Another lost soul looking for guidance, eh? I suppose you want to find a purpose - your purpose. I've seen it a thousand times, another hero looking for work. Well, today's your lucky day, friend. Hogral's got the cure for your ailment. Here's what you do: Take this road here up to Ironforge and make your way to the Forlorn Cavern. Once there, locate the thieves' guild and speak with Hulfdan Blackbeard. He'll put you on the road to salvation.Simple Subterfugin'^10^Alliance^Rogue^Hulfdan Blackbeard^Onin MacHammar^Road to Salvation^^^Find Onin MacHammar by Gnomeregan.^Ye see, the King be strip mining the quarry fer ore and gems. More riches than any one dwarf should see in ten lifetimes. The Hidden Circle has values, <name>. We value valuables. Can ye understand? Now we feels the King should be sharing some of that booty, but we don't want ol' 'Stinkbeard' to know he's sharin' - if ye catch me drift. We needs ye to speak with Onin MacHammar over by Gnomeregan and bring back a report. The crafty dwarf has hidden hisself amongst the lepers. Be careful.Onin's Report^10^Alliance^Rogue^Onin MacHammar^Hulfdan Blackbeard^Road to Salvation^^^Take Onin's Report back to Hulfdan in Ironforge.^The Quarry? Yap, I see those monstrous armored steam tanks come by this post near every day. My contacts to the east tell me that the tank starts off at Ironforge, makes a pickup at the Gol'Bolar Quarry, stops over at Kharanos to refuel and then for some blasted reason, it takes the long way around past Gnomeregan, before reaching Ironforge to drop off the shipment. It's all in the report, <race>. Take it back to Hulfdan so he can plan the next step.The Hidden Chamber^40^Alliance^Ironforge^Baelog^Prospector Stormpike^The Lost Dwarves^^^Read Baelog's Journal, explore the hidden chamber, then report to Prospector Stormpike.^Now for the task at hand. There is a secret chamber, the Chamber of Khaz'mul, that must be explored. The problem is that the chamber's behind a huge, locked door! It's a lucky thing I know how to open it. I've described everything in my journal, here on the table. My band and I are stuck here for now... so you, <name>, must find the chamber of Khaz'mul for us! Read my journal, explore the chamber, then report to Prospector Stormpike at the Explorers' League in Ironforge.The Apple Falls^10^Alliance^Rogue^Jannok Breezesong^Syurna^^^Destiny Calls^Take Jannok's Rose to Syurna in Darnassus.^They say I'm 'lovestruck,' whatever that means. Sure, I spend my every waking moment thinking about Syurna. Sure, my home is full of paintings and drawings of Syurna. Sure, I often go days without eating, sleeping, or drinking, while I lament about the love we could have had. Is that so wrong? Now she won't see me! ME! I've tried sending her messages but she won't even talk to another person unless they are a rogue. Could you deliver this flower to her? Don't forget to tell her it's from Jannok.Destiny Calls^10^Alliance^Rogue^Syurna^Syurna^^The Apple FallsRequires one ofThe Apple Falls^^Find Sethir the Ancient and bring back any clues that you may discover to Syurna.^We believe there is one being that may be able to help us understand what is happening to the forests of Teldrassil. Unfortunately, getting the creature to cooperate has proven disastrous. He hides on a branch at the outskirts of the Oracle Glade. All who have so far approached the satyr, whether through force or diplomacy, have met with doom. Perhaps stealth is the answer, <name>. Find what Sethir the Ancient carries in his packs and report back to me.Badlands Reagent Run^39^Horde^Badlands^Jarkal Mossmeld^Jarkal Mossmeld^Badlands Reagent Run^^^Bring 5 Buzzard Gizzards, 10 Crag Coyote Fangs, and 5 Rock Elemental Shards to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath, Badlands.^<name>, I could use your aid if you're up for it. I am an alchemist of some note, and I seek your aid in acquiring some reagents found out in the Badlands. I need the following items to replenish my stocks: five buzzard gizzards, ten crag coyote fangs, and five rock elemental shards. Obviously, you can get them off of the beasties themselves; if you're not the fighting type, then find friends who are. Acquire these items for me, you'll get some coin out of the deal. Watcha wanna do?Erion Shadewhisper^16^Alliance^Rogue^Jannok Breezesong^Erion Shadewhisper^Erion Shadewhisper^^Erion's Behest^Contact Erion Shadewhisper in Darnassus.^Do not worry, <name>, I am not sending you to see Syurna. Erion requires your presence at the Cenarion Enclave. Make haste!Erion's Behest^16^Alliance^Rogue^Erion Shadewhisper^Renzik "The Shiv"^Erion Shadewhisper^^^Travel to Stormwind City and seek council with Renzik "The Shiv."^Word of your deeds has spread far and wide, <name>. So far, in fact, that Stormwind Intelligence has asked for you by name. The journey is taxing and not without peril, but an opportunity to train under SI:7 should not be taken lightly. A new world awaits you, <name>. Make your way to Old Town in Stormwind and speak with Renzik "The Shiv" at SI:7 headquarters.The Platinum Discs^47^All^^The Discs of Norgannon^The Discs of Norgannon^^^The Platinum Discs, The Platinum Discs^Speak with stone watcher and learn what ancient lore it keeps. Once you have learned what lore it has to offer, activate the Discs of Norgannon.^The centerpieces of this treasure chamber are four huge platinum discs, each adorned with numerous sigils of an unknown origin. Touching them makes your hand tingle. Just after touching the discs, the visage of a large stone watcher springs forth. "Salutations. I am a keeper of knowledge. The Creators' synthesis of the Earthen has been chronicled and stored here for this world in the Discs of Norgannon." You have uncovered a wealth of previously undiscovered worldly lore!The Platinum Discs^47^Alliance^Ironforge^The Discs of Norgannon^High Explorer Magellas^The Platinum Discs^The Platinum Discs^The Platinum Discs^Take the miniature version of the Discs of Norgannon to the Explorers' League in Ironforge.^Touching the Discs of Norgannon once again makes your hand tingle. This time, however, a strange grinding noise is heard from inside the discs. Your backpack suddenly becomes heavier than it was before. Inside, you discover a miniature version of the discs! No doubt, an item of this sort would be invaluable for someone interested in the ancient history of Azeroth. The Explorers' League in Ironforge is such a group, known throughout the Alliance; perhaps they can make good use of it.The Platinum Discs^47^Horde^Thunder Bluff^The Discs of Norgannon^Sage Truthseeker^^The Platinum Discs^The Platinum Discs^Take the miniature version of the Discs of Norgannon to the one of the sages in Thunder Bluff.^Touching the Discs of Norgannon once again makes your hand tingle. This time, however, a strange grinding noise is heard from inside the discs. Your backpack suddenly becomes heavier than it was before. Inside, you discover a miniature version of the discs! No doubt, an item of this sort would be invaluable for someone interested in the ancient history of Azeroth. The sages of Thunder Bluff are such historians, known throughout the Horde; perhaps they can make good use of it.Redridge Rendezvous^16^Alliance^Rogue^Renzik "The Shiv"^Lucius^SI:7^^^Venture forth to Lakeshire in the Redridge Mountains and speak with Lucius.^Sending you out in the field now would be suicide. Renzik doesn't need another dead rogue on his hands. Don't fret, though, <name> - Renzik is going to get you up to speed. Make your way to the Redridge Mountains and speak with an associate of SI:7 named Lucius. You will find him hanging around the docks of Lakeshire with the other shady good-for-nothings.Alther's Mill^20^Alliance^Rogue^Lucius^Lucius^SI:7^^^Open Lucius's Lockbox, recover the Token of Thievery and return it to Lucius in Lakeshire.^We've been training thieves here for years! After all, not every rapscallion is born with the grace and finesse of old Lucius. Up off the road here you'll find Alther's Mill. I got a chest up there with something important inside. Go get it for me! Bring back that token and you'll receive your Certificate of Thievery!Necklace Recovery^41^All^Orgrimmar^Dran Droffers^Dran Droffers^Necklace Recovery^^^Look for a valuable necklace within the Uldaman dig site and bring it back to Dran Droffers in Orgrimmar. The necklace may be damaged.^We've got work for you, that is if you've got the guts to do it! Deep in the Badlands is the Uldaman dig site. We've heard a tale about some idiot paladin who died there recently. Why we even care is that he had a very valuable necklace on him. It's supposedly got three large gems: a ruby, a sapphire, and a topaz. The shot: we want it, and we're payin' TOP SILVER to get it. It may be damaged, but that's neither here nor there; we'll fix whatever scratches are on it.Necklace Recovery, Take 2^41^All^Orgrimmar^Dran Droffers^Remains of a Paladin^Necklace Recovery^^^Find a clue as to the gems' whereabouts in the depths of Uldaman.^As sure as Malton is a dummy, those gems are still in Uldaman somewhere. You're going to have to go back there and look for them. Like I said before, if the information we have is correct then there's a ruby, a sapphire, and a topaz that go with the necklace. Find them and put them in the necklace. As to where the gems are, who knows? Maybe you'll get lucky and find the corpse of the Paladin. If he's not been stripped clean already, then maybe he's got them on him still.Kingly Shakedown^16^Alliance^Rogue^Hulfdan Blackbeard^Renzik "The Shiv"^To Hulfdan!^^^Travel to Stormwind and seek out Renzik "The Shiv."^So there we were, about to start plottin' out phase III when a couple o' Magni's blockheads come bargin' in here talkin' bout some kind o' heist and arresting some o' the Hidden Circle. Well nobody puts the iron on old Blackbeard! The argumentations got heavy and thick and somehow yer name weres blurted out! Me advice? Take the first Gryphon out o' Ironforge and get to Stormwind. Get yerself to Old Town and once there, talk to an old friend o' mine named Renzik "The Shiv."To Hulfdan!^16^Alliance^Rogue^Hogral Bakkan^Hulfdan Blackbeard^To Hulfdan!^^Erion's Behest^Travel to Ironforge and speak with Hulfdan Blackbeard.^Where have you been, <name>?

I wouldn't keep Mathias's second in command waiting if I were you.Translating the Journal^42^All^Badlands^Remains of a Paladin^Jarkal Mossmeld^Necklace Recovery^^^Find someone who can translate the paladin's journal. The closest location that might have someone is Kargath, in the Badlands.^At an impasse of sorts, you know that you will need the book translated into a language you can understand. There certainly are a number of people in the world who could do it; the closest location that might have someone who could, however, is the Kargath outpost in the Badlands. Perhaps that is a good place to start.Translating the Journal^42^All^Badlands^Jarkal Mossmeld^Jarkal Mossmeld^Necklace Recovery^^Find the Gems and Power Source^Let Jarkal borrow the necklace. In exchange, he will translate the journal for you.^Droffers and Son Salvage aren't smart enough to restore the magic in the necklace, but I am. All I want to do is study the necklace so I can learn to make them myself. To do that, I will need your necklace. Let me borrow it, and in exchange for the time I get to study it I will translate the journal for you. While you are searching for the gems, I should have enough time to learn what I need to. It's a simple deal, and no one else will be the wiser. Whatcha wanna do?Find the Gems and Power Source^44^Horde^Badlands^Jarkal Mossmeld^Jarkal Mossmeld^^Translating the Journal^Deliver the Gems^Recover all three gems and a power source for the necklace from Uldaman, and then bring them to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath. Jarkal believes a power source might be found on the strongest construct present in Uldaman.^Here is the journal, translated for you to read on your own. The crux of it says dwarves hid the ruby, the troggs hid the topaz, and a trogg named Grimlok has the sapphire. Look - you're going to need a power source to make the necklace work again. Dran Droffers doesn't know this. To find one, here's what I'd do: go as deep as you can in Uldaman and kill whatever construct there is the strongest. No doubt whatever that is would have it. When you have everything collected, come back here!Deliver the Gems^44^Horde^Orgrimmar^Jarkal Mossmeld^Dran Droffers^Deliver the Gems^Find the Gems and Power Source^^Deliver the Necklace and Gem Salvage to Dran Droffers in Orgrimmar.^Any necklace setting and gem will work, so long as they are the same material. This power source, however, is what will bring the magic back to the necklace... I hope. I'll gladly supply the gems needed for your version of the necklace, so long as the power source actually works. Head to Orgrimmar and keep your end of the bargain with Droffers and Son Salvage. Just keep your mouth shut about our deal, and when you get back I might have a wonderful surprise for you.Necklace Recovery, Take 3^44^Horde^Badlands^Dran Droffers^Jarkal Mossmeld^Deliver the Gems^^^Visit Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath to see if he was successful.^As Dran and Malton Droffers begin to squabble over their new salvage, half of the deal is now complete. A trip to the Badlands is now in order to finish things up, as Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath might have a special reward waiting for you there.Reclaimed Treasures^43^Horde^Undercity^Patrick Garrett^Patrick Garrett^^^^Get Patrick Garrett's family treasure from their family chest in the South Common Hall of Uldaman, and bring it to him in the Undercity.^Sweeping the bat pens with this broom is not befitting a Garrett! I've earned a little coin from this accursed job, and I'm willing to spend it on you to better my station. The Garrett family weapon of choice is locked away in our chest in the South Common Hall of Uldaman from when we Garretts toiled there as diggers. Without it, I will be stuck here forever - literally - sweeping up after these infernal bats. Reclaim my family's treasure and bring it to me! Help me restore my birthright!Horns of Nez'ra^22^All^Rogue^Arantir^Arantir^^^^Return the Horns of Nez'ra to Arantir in Lakeshire.^Many years ago, the Horns of Nez'ra were stolen from Ravenholdt manor. Across continents and oceans I have searched, only to discover that these insignificant beasts have had it in their possession all along. Slay every Blackrock orc you cross until the Horns of Nez'ra are recovered. Should you recover the horns, find me in Lakeshire. Do this for me and your name shall be known to Ravenholdt, <name>.Klaven's Tower^20^Alliance^Rogue^Agent Kearnen^Master Mathias Shaw^Mathias and the Defias^^^Steal the Defias Tower Key, break into the Defias Tower and uncover the contents of the Duskwood Chest. Take whatever information you find back to Mathias Shaw in Stormwind. Read Kearnen's Journal to gain insight about the tower.^I've been staking out this tower for weeks, <name>. Recently a major shipment came through from Duskwood, and along with it came those guards. What are they? Your guess is as good as mine. I can tell you one thing - they aren't human. Anyhow, the shipment had a chest - which is what I assume those abominations are guarding. The zombie with the spikes holds a key we'll need. Get that key, get in the tower, and uncover whatever is in that chest. Take your findings back to Mathias.Mathias and the Defias^20^Alliance^Rogue^Master Mathias Shaw^Agent Kearnen^Mathias and the Defias^^^Travel to Westfall and find Agent Kearnen for your debriefing.^Not a moment too soon, <name>. SI:7 reconnaissance is reporting unusually heavy Defias activity in Westfall.

While you have shown aptitude in the ways of stealth and deception, you still require much training. The Deathstalkers have allies within the Shattered Hand. Seek out those that would assist us - find Shenthul in Orgrimmar.Zando'zan^16^Horde^Rogue^Shenthul^Zando'zan^Find the Shattered Hand^^Wrenix of Ratchet^Speak with Zando'zan at the Cleft of Shadow.^Your determination alone is not enough to overcome the obstacles that lay ahead of us. Speak with Zando'zan to begin your training as an operative of the Shattered Hand.

You've obviously impressed those in charge with your meager skills, as the great Shenthul has asked for you by name. Take the road north of here to Orgrimmar and speak with Shenthul in the Cleft of Shadow.Plundering the Plunderers^18^Horde^Rogue^Wrenix the Wretched^Wrenix the Wretched^Find the Shattered Hand^^^Bring the Southsea Treasure back to Wrenix the Wretched in Ratchet. Do not forget to get an E.C.A.C. and Thieves' Tools from Wrenix's Gizmotronic Apparatus. You will need both of these items to complete your mission.^I don't mean to scare you, <name>, but the last five thieves I sent to steal the southsea treasure came back to me in pieces. South along the coast you'll find Tide Razor, the southsea freebooter's ship. Nestled in the hold is the payoff - the southsea treasure. On the second level of that ship is the pirate's den, a place where they train all of their thieves. Board that ship, steal the treasure, and bring it back to me. Use the pirate's den if you need to practice your thievery, but be careful!Wrenix of Ratchet^16^Horde^Rogue^Zando'zan^Wrenix the Wretched^Find the Shattered Hand^^^Travel to Ratchet in the Barrens and speak with Wrenix the Wretched.^Zando'zan has seen it!

You'll find him outside the Den, taking cover in the shade.The Lost Dwarves^40^Alliance^^Prospector Stormpike^Baelog^The Lost Dwarves^^^Find Baelog in Uldaman.^The dig site at Uldaman wasn't always overrun. We Ironforge dwarves used to control the area, but... that was before the troggs came. They came so fast and in such numbers that not even dwarven might could stop them! In fact, their attack was so sudden that I fear some of our people may be trapped behind enemy lines. My friend Baelog led a small band of dwarves deep within the site just before the troggs showed up. If he and his company live, then I want you to find them.Power Stones^36^All^Badlands^Rigglefuzz^Rigglefuzz^^^^Bring 8 Dentrium Power Stones and 8 An'Alleum Power Stones to Rigglefuzz in the Badlands.^A while ago, I had an incident with the Shadowforge Dwarves. They brought me to Angor Fortress to study two types of strange stones from Uldaman. I discovered that the stones were sustained, stable power sources if treated correctly. It's amazing the things one can find in that old dig site! Anyway, after I told them the secret of the stones they kicked me out of Angor Fortress and began digging for more in Uldaman. I want those stones for myself! Bring me both types and I'll pay you plenty!The Emerald Dreamcatcher^6^All^Teldrassil^Tallonkai Swiftroot^Tallonkai Swiftroot^The Emerald Dreamcatcher^^^Bring the Emerald Dreamcatcher to Tallonkai Swiftroot in Dolanaar.^I was once given an emerald dreamcatcher from Gaerolas Talvethen, the warden of the druids in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. This powerful amulet is able to siphon energy from the Emerald Dream, bestowing luck upon those who carry it. Sadly, I have not been able to retrieve it from my dresser in Starbreeze Village... Although Starbreeze was once a tranquil place, it has now succumbed to the corruption of the furbolg that reside there. Perhaps you would be willing to recover my dreamcatcher, <class>?The Platinum Discs^47^Alliance^Ironforge^High Explorer Magellas^Dinita Stonemantle^The Platinum Discs^^Portents of Uldum^Take your reward voucher to Dinita Stonemantle in the Vault of Ironforge.^This object is an incredible find.

Tower, north of the Sludge Fen and contact the Shattered Hand's covert operative, Taskmaster Fizzule.^The Venture Company... Perhaps you have heard of them? For one year we have worked on planting an agent deep within their ranks. Through much hard work and careful planning, we succeeded. Recently we received word that the Venture Co. are planning something on a grand scale. Go north of the Sludge Fen to the Venture Co. tower and contact our undercover agent, Taskmaster Fizzule. When you find the tower, use this flare gun, then approach Fizzule and show him the salute of the Shattered Hand.Ferocitas the Dream Eater^8^All^Teldrassil^Tallonkai Swiftroot^Tallonkai Swiftroot^The Emerald Dreamcatcher^^^Tallonkai Swiftroot in Dolanaar wants you to kill 7 Gnarlpine Mystics and find the Missing Jewel.^The emerald... It is missing! My dreamcatcher has been damaged! There is a band of Gnarlpine mystics located to the north of Starbreeze. I have heard reports that their leader, Ferocitas the Dream Eater has been wearing a necklace that glows green in the night. Now seeing my dreamcatcher, I am sure that he has stolen my emerald... He would never realize that its power is useless to him. Find this missing jewel, <name>. And, while you're there, clear out some of the corrupted mystics as well.The Shattered Salute^20^Horde^Rogue^Shenthul^Shenthul^Rogues of the Shattered Hand^^^Perform the Shattered Salute on Shenthul.^As a rogue of the Shattered Hand, it is imperative that you learn the Shattered Salute.

Drones, two Venture Co. Patrollers, and two Venture Co. Lookouts.^You will need to steal the tower key from Foreman Silixiz, <name>. Once you've got the key in your possession, hold on to it - I may need it later. Remember, the poison has weakened everything in this tower. Use your abilities to bring chaos and destruction to its inhabitants. Slay them all -- show no mercy! Once everything inside lays in a bloodied heap, pick Gallywix's lockbox and steal the cache of Zanzil's mixture held inside. Take both the head of Gallywix and the mixture to Shenthul in Orgrimmar.Hinott's Assistance^20^Horde^Rogue^Shenthul^Serge Hinott^Mission: Possible But Not Probable^^^Travel to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad Foothills and deliver the Sample of Zanzil's Mixture to Serge Hinott.^Take a sample of the mixture to Serge Hinott in Tarren Mill. If anyone can cure you, it's Serge. Live long enough and Serge will show you the ways of poison creation and use.Hinott's Assistance^20^Horde^Rogue^Serge Hinott^Serge Hinott^Mission: Possible But Not Probable^^^Wait for Serge Hinott to complete the cure.^I have never seen such wondrous results from a poison! Zanzil you say? Never heard of him, however, I must commend him on the creation of this concoction. So, I am to cure you of this and then teach you how to make use of the poison? Give me a few moments to examine the toxin, <name>.Return to Denalan^9^All^Teldrassil^Rellian Greenspyre^Denalan^Return to Denalan^Tumors^^Rellian Greenspyre wants you to speak with Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth.^I have just received word that Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth has discovered what may be the cause of the tumors that plague the timberlings.

Make haste, <name>; he needs our help.Oakenscowl^9^All^Teldrassil^Denalan^Denalan^Return to Denalan^^^Denalan at Lake Al'Ameth wants you to collect the Gargantuan Tumor from Oakenscowl.^In a cave along the southern bank of the lake, a timberling named Oakenscowl is spreading corruption to all the creatures that make Lake Al'Ameth their home. I dared not get too close, but even from a distance, it is obvious: Oakenscowl is being poisoned by the largest tumor I have ever seen... I would call it gargantuan, even. <name>, you have already done much to aid my efforts, but I ask of you one more task. Hunt down Oakenscowl and collect the tumor; remove this source of corruption from my home.Badlands Reagent Run^39^Alliance^Loch Modan^Ghak Healtouch^Ghak Healtouch^^^Uldaman Reagent Run, Badlands Reagent Run II^Acquire the reagents Ghak Healtouch needs from the Badlands, then return to him in Thelsamar.^<class>, I would make use of your services. I am an alchemist of some note, and I seek your aid in acquiring some reagents found out in the Badlands. I need the following items to replenish my stocks: five buzzard gizzards, ten crag coyote fangs, and five rock elemental shards. Obviously, you can get them off of the beasties themselves; if you're not the fighting type, then find friends who are. Acquire these items for me, you'll get some coin out of the deal. Well, what say ye?Badlands Reagent Run II^44^Alliance^Loch Modan^Ghak Healtouch^Ghak Healtouch^^Badlands Reagent Run^^Use the empty thaumaturgy vessels on scorched guardian dragons found in the Badlands. Once you have them filled, bring them to Ghak Healtouch in Thelsamar.^You have been most helpful to me, <name>. I would like to reward you with the very recipe for the brew I gave you earlier, but I must ask of you a favor that is quite dangerous. This lockbox contains three empty thaumaturgy vessels; they are imbued with an attunement aura that will drain the blood of a scorched guardian dragon. Using one on the beast will anger it greatly, so be careful. Once you have all three filled, bring them to me. Do this, and the recipe will be yours.Tears of the Moon^12^Alliance^Darnassus^Priestess A'moora^Priestess A'moora^The Temple of the Moon^^^Priestess A'moora in the Temple of the Moon at Darnassus wants you to bring her Lady Sathrah's Silvery Spinnerets.^Lady Sathrah was once beloved of Elune. Graceful and pure, the spider spun her silver threads through the moonlight, catching the evening mist. The silvery dew had strong healing powers and was kept here in the temple. But of late, Sathrah has descended into madness. Her future generations are now threatened as well. Find Lady Sathrah, <name>, and end her suffering.

When you have completed this, return to me.To Serve Kum'isha^55^All^Blasted Lands^Kum'isha the Collector^Kum'isha the Collector^^^Kum'isha's Endeavors^In your journeys throughout the Blasted Lands, should you ever come across a Flawless Draenethyst Sphere, take the item back to Kum'isha the Collector.^<race>, can your miniscule brain comprehend the rarity of a flawless sphere of draenethyst? Draenei have spent lifetimes in search of just one of these crystals, only to meet horrible fates, their purpose unfulfilled. So you stand before Kum'isha, knowing what Kum'isha has requested and still wish to assist? Very well, <race>... At any time during your travels across these lands, should you find a flawless sphere of draenethyst, return it to me and I shall reward you with riches beyond your wildest dreams.Kum'isha's Endeavors^55^All^Blasted Lands^Kum'isha the Collector^Kum'isha the Collector^^To Serve Kum'isha^^Find and return a Flawless Draenethyst Sphere to Kum'isha the Collector.^Even though the portal conjuration was a failure, I remain hopeful that my next attempt will be successful. The hope of the Draenei is as fervent as your greed for trinkets, <race>. Go back out into these cursed lands and recover another flawless draenethyst sphere. Of course, the choice to take on this task is completely left to you *grin*.The Sleeping Druid^8^All^Teldrassil^Oben Rageclaw^Oben Rageclaw^The Sleeping Druid^^^Bring a Shaman Voodoo Charm to Oben Rageclaw in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den.^The Gnarlpine shaman that inhabit this place have discovered a way of separating a sleeping druid's spirit from the physical body. The furbolg have animated my physical form and are using it to attack anyone that attempts to explore the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. I am now trapped in the Emerald Dream, powerless to stop this. You must help me. The Gnarlpine shaman carry a strange charm which is used to perform this ritual, and I'd like to examine it. Please, <name>, bring one to me.Druid of the Claw^10^All^Teldrassil^Oben Rageclaw^Oben Rageclaw^The Sleeping Druid^^^Oben Rageclaw wants you to kill his soulless body, and then use the Voodoo Charm.^After examining this charm, <name>, I see now what must be done. Please take it, and do as I ask. You are to explore the deepest areas of the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. There, you will find my soulless body... Although I regret what I am about to tell you, I see no other way to free myself from the control of the Gnarlpine. In order for me to escape them, you must kill my physical form. Once that is done, use the voodoo charm on my fallen body. After you have completed this task, please return to me.Snickerfang Jowls^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Drazial^Bloodmage Drazial^^^Rage of Ages^Bring three Snickerfang Jowls, two Blasted Boar Lungs, and one Scorpok Pincer to Bloodmage Drazial.^It is a well known fact that hyenas possess tremendous strength in their jowls, but the strength to snap through three inches of thorium steel? Impossible, improbable, and yet I have seen this demonstrated with my own eyes. Venture forth, into the Blasted Lands, and bring me three snickerfang jowls. As you search for the snickerfang, be on the lookout for boars and scorpoks: The initial assay also requires two blasted boar lungs and one scorpok pincer to complete.Rage of Ages^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Drazial^Bloodmage Drazial^^Snickerfang Jowls^^Bring three Snickerfang Jowls, two Blasted Boar Lungs, and one Scorpok Pincer to Bloodmage Drazial.^Ah, <name>, welcome back. It seems you enjoyed the effect of the robust, operational imbue, derived from snickerfang. Be warned, while the immediate effect is a titanic burst of strength, the long term effects on your spirit and intelligence could be hazardous. With that said, do you require more? If so, bring me another three snickerfang jowls, two blasted boar lungs, and one scorpok pincer.A Boar's Vitality^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Drazial^Bloodmage Drazial^^^Spirit of the Boar^Bring three Blasted Boar Lungs, two Scorpok Pincers, and one Basilisk Brain to Bloodmage Drazial.^Within these blasted lands exists two species of boar: the ash-mane boar and the helboar. It would appear that the stamina of these beasts renders them nearly immune to harm, as the other animals find them too difficult to kill and consequently, not worth the effort. We need to perform further analysis, <name>. Should you bring me three blasted boar lungs, two scorpok pincers, and one basilisk brain, I shall create a divine elixir from the residue of the assay. You will be my first test subject!Spirit of the Boar^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Drazial^Bloodmage Drazial^^A Boar's Vitality^^Bring three Blasted Boar Lungs, two Scorpok Pincers, and one Basilisk Brain to Bloodmage Drazial.^When I first administered the elixir, <name>, I could tell that one or two applications would not satiate your appetite. Even now, I can see the hunger in your eyes. The concoction has addictive properties of which, seemingly, the most strong of will cannot resist. So be it! Should you require more of the lung juice cocktail, venture back into the wasteland and find for me three blasted boar lungs, two scorpok pincers, and one basilisk brain.The Decisive Striker^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Drazial^Bloodmage Drazial^^^Salt of the Scorpok^Bring three Scorpok Pincers, two Vulture Gizzards, and one Blasted Boar Lung to Bloodmage Drazial.^Have you ever watched them in battle, <name>? The scorpoks, I mean. Have you ever seen the grace and agility with which they move? The decisiveness of their strikes? If only we could somehow isolate that agility and encapsulate it, we would be wealthy beyond our... I mean... it would be a boon for the scientific community. Assist me, <name>, and I shall allow you a sampling of the assay. In order to create a stable sample, I will need three scorpok pincers, two vulture gizzards, and one blasted boar lung.Salt of the Scorpok^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Drazial^Bloodmage Drazial^^The Decisive Striker^^Bring three Scorpok Pincers, two Vulture Gizzards, and one Blasted Boar Lung to Bloodmage Drazial.^You live! This is good news, indeed. I assume you are back for more of the scorpok assay? Very well, <name>, back to the wasteland with you and do not return until you have collected three scorpok pincers, two vulture gizzards, and one blasted boar lung.The Basilisk's Bite^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Lynnore^Bloodmage Lynnore^^^Infallible Mind^Bring ten Basilisk Brains and two Vulture Gizzards to Bloodmage Lynnore.^These wastelands are riddled with redstone basilisk, <name>. These basilisk have adapted and flourished, more so than any of the other wildlife within the region. I have watched from afar as they hunt and go about their daily activities - the beasts exhibit a thought process more complex than even some humanoids. I must study their brains! Retrieve ten of their brains for me, <name>. The compound cannot be complete, however, without two vulture gizzards to form the base of the solution.Infallible Mind^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Lynnore^Bloodmage Lynnore^^The Basilisk's Bite^^Bring ten Basilisk Brains and two Vulture Gizzards to Bloodmage Lynnore.^Your focused concentration has dwindled so soon? More research must be done! Oh yes, the price remains the same, <name>. Venture forth into the blasted lands and return to me with ten brains from the redstone and two vulture gizzards.Vulture's Vigor^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Lynnore^Bloodmage Lynnore^^^Spiritual Domination^Bring ten Vulture Gizzards and two Snickerfang Jowls to Bloodmage Lynnore.^Death does indeed have wings in these blasted lands, <race>. I have witnessed the black slayers and bonepickers feasting upon the corpse of many a fallen explorer - sometimes feeding upon the most vile and disease ridden of carcasses. It is a wonder, then, how their internal systems overcome the pestilence that claims these lands. Assist me in my studies, <name>! Gizzards I need! Two snickerfang jowls will also be required for the base of the concoction. You shall be rewarded two-fold for your efforts.Spiritual Domination^50^All^Blasted Lands^Bloodmage Lynnore^Bloodmage Lynnore^^Vulture's Vigor^^Bring ten Vulture Gizzards and two Snickerfang Jowls to Bloodmage Lynnore.^I see that the inner fire has dwindled. Would you say the spiritual euphoria lasted an hour? If it's more of the gizzard gum you desire, then more of the gizzards I require. Back to the wastelands, <name>. Do not return until you have recovered ten gizzards and two jowls.The Thirsty Goblin^49^All^Tanaris^Marin Noggenfogger^Marin Noggenfogger^The Thirsty Goblin^^^Collect a Laden Dew Gland and bring it to Marin Noggenfogger in Gadgetzan.^I've got an idea, see. I've heard of some strange creatures called dew collectors that live to the southwest... and that they are able to store water in special glands. I think that if I could get one of these glands, I could create a drink that would quench my terrible thirst! Do you think you could help me, <name>? Look for the cactus garden, <name>; that's where you'll find the dew collectors.In Good Taste^49^All^Tanaris^Marin Noggenfogger^Sprinkle^The Thirsty Goblin^^^Marin Noggenfogger wants you to speak with Sprinkle in Gadgetzan.^Blech! This stuff tastes terrible! So much for that idea... Wait, what's that? Oh, I know, I know, you think I shouldn't give up on this stuff. Well, okay then. Uhhhh, I have an idea! Brilliant! Take this dew to my friend Sprinkle -- she's an excellent chef. Tell her what we're up to here and that we want to make it go down a little easier. I mean, if it's going to taste that bad, it at least should have some kick to it... And I'm just not feeling it...The Touch of Zanzil^20^Alliance^Rogue^Master Mathias Shaw^Doc Mixilpixil^Mathias and the Defias^^The Touch of Zanzil^Speak with Doc Mixilpixil in the cellar of the Barracks.^It appears as if you've brought back more information than even I expected. This certainly is a strange turn of events, <name>. A cure? Hrm... Go down to the cellar and speak with Doc Mixilpixil - he may be able to help.The Touch of Zanzil^20^Alliance^Rogue^Doc Mixilpixil^Doc Mixilpixil^^The Touch of Zanzil^The Touch of Zanzil^/Lay down to be examined by Doc Mixilpixil. How can he find the cure if he can't find the cause?^Oh my, you look like death. Correction - I've seen death, you look worse than death. You, <sir/miss>, would be what death coughed up at his last physical. Hah! You hear that Noarm? Write that one down! *Cough* Hrm yes, in order for me to help you, I'll need to draw some blood. Don't worry, it only hurts the first few... fifty times or so... /lay down when you're ready for the treatment, <name>.The Touch of Zanzil^20^Alliance^Rogue^Doc Mixilpixil^Doc Mixilpixil^^The Touch of Zanzil^^Bring Doc Mixilpixil one bundle of Simple Wildflowers, one Leaded Vial, one Bronze Tube, and one Spool of Light Chartreuse Silk Thread. The 'itis' doesn't cure itself, young <fella/lady>.^It's unanimous, <name>. You've got the 'itis.' Luckily, I have a cure for the 'itis.' Here's what I need: One bundle of simple wildflowers, one leaded vial, one bronze tube, and last but certainly not least, one spool of light chartreuse silk thread. Ol' Emma left a spool of it for me at 'The Finest Thread.' You can find the shop along the canals. Hurry along now, <name>, and try not to touch anyone until you're cured. Oh, and Dr. Montgomery says you need a shower -- his words, not mine.The Disgraced One^50^Horde^Blasted Lands^Fallen Hero of the Horde^Dispatch Commander Ruag^Fall From Grace^^^Speak to Dispatch Commander Ruag at Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows.^Regret. It is all I have now. One bad decision resulting in several horrible outcomes. If only I had waited for those orders. Maybe they would have detailed the horrors that awaited us in those cursed lands! Maybe they were to redirect us to another detail? Ultimately, it was my fault. All of it was my fault. So here I stand, awaiting orders. I must know. I must have those orders. Dispatch Commander Ruag resides in Stonard. Find him and find out what became of the orders.The Missing Orders^50^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Dispatch Commander Ruag^Bengor^Fall From Grace^^^Speak to Bengor at Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows.^The orders? What could you possibly want with the orders? What are you implying, <name>? Of course I relayed those orders! The soldiers I sent the orders with were ambushed and brutally beaten by murlocs. Only one survived, if you can call that surviving. He can hardly speak, cannot walk, and must be fed through a tube. If you want to know what happened to those orders, speak with Bengor. I'm sure he is around here somewhere... and, <name>, be mindful of what you stick your nose into - it may get bitten off.The Swamp Talker^55^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Bengor^Fallen Hero of the Horde^Fall From Grace^^A Tale of Sorrow^Retrieve the Warchief's Orders and return them to the Fallen Hero of the Horde.^Orders were given by the dispatch commander. We took... took orders. On way to Blasted Lands, ambushed. Murlocs... Many murlocs... One named Swamp Talker. Took orders from my hands as spear thrust into my skull. East... cave.... <Bengor passes out.>Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient^49^All^Tanaris^Sprinkle^Sprinkle^The Thirsty Goblin^^Delivery for Marin^Sprinkle in Gadgetzan wants you to collect a Violet Tragan and return it to her.^When I was a kid, my sister used to do all the cooking. It was horrible! I could barely stomach some of her concoctions -- until I found what I like to call my "secret" ingredient! Add it to anything, and... WOW! It tastes great! What is it, you ask? It's a mushroom called the Violet Tragan. If you want me to help you turn this horrid-tasting brew into something edible, head to the Hinterlands, and look for a small lake there. Oh, and remember, the Violet Tragan can only be found underwater.Delivery for Marin^49^All^Tanaris^Sprinkle^Marin Noggenfogger^Delivery for Marin^Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient^^Sprinkle wants to you take the Violet Powder to Marin Noggenfogger in Gadgetzan.^Here's the Violet Powder, <name>. Take it to Marin and tell him he owes me a favor!Noggenfogger Elixir^49^All^Tanaris^Marin Noggenfogger^Marin Noggenfogger^Delivery for Marin^^^Marin Noggenfogger wants you to speak to him again after he creates his elixir.^Now, to mix this powder in with the dew.

Return to the Fallen Hero when your task is complete. You must remain within close proximity of the stones or the process will fail.^It will take more than you alone to overcome the forces of Razelikh and his subordinates. Gather a suitable group of adventurers and free my men of their eternal torture! Eighteen stones you must shatter. Fight hard and die with honor, <name>.Heroes of Old^57^All^Blasted Lands^Corporal Thund Splithoof^Corporal Thund Splithoof^Petty Squabbles^^Kirith^Open the chest and claim your reward.^Please, take from this a relic of old.

One of my men is still unaccounted for, lost somewhere in the Blasted Lands. I am talking about Lieutenant Kirith, of course. As I had mentioned earlier, we were both imprisoned and tortured by Allistarj, but poor Kirith, his strength of will faltered. I could hear the experiments from my cage; the tortured screams rang through the halls of the cave. That was the last I saw or heard of Kirith.Rin'ji is Trapped!^47^Horde^The Hinterlands^Rin'ji^Rin'ji's Secret^Rin'ji is Trapped!^^^Escort Rin'ji out of the Quel'Danil Lodge, then find his hidden secret at the Overlook Cliffs to the east.^Hey <race>!

Do you think you're capable of such a thing? You decide. If so, then make haste to the castle and find an old friend of mine, a gnome named Tyrion. He's been watching Lescovar now for a couple weeks.

The soft soles are a blessing to those seeking quiet movement in footwear. For this pattern, I need two Nightscape pants and two Nightscape boots crafted. I also will require two wildvines... not just one. When you have these items, we will proceed.Wild Leather Leggings^45^Horde^Leatherworking^Jangdor Swiftstrider^Jangdor Swiftstrider^^Wild Leather Armor^Master of the Wild Leather^Bring 2 Turtle Scale Helms, 2 Turtle Scale Bracers, and 2 Wildvines to Jangdor Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.^You are ready to master more complex lessons, <name>. Wild Leather leggings are some of the sturdiest and powerful leather gear around. The waist, thighs, calves, and the vitals - all are given tremendous protection. Coupled with the enhancement that the wildvine provides, adventurers who own it will thank you each time they see you. For you to gain this pattern, I need two Turtle Scale helms, two Turtle Scale bracers, and two wildvines.Master of the Wild Leather^45^Horde^Leatherworking^Jangdor Swiftstrider^Una^^Wild Leather Shoulders, Wild Leather Vest, Wild Leather Helmet, Wild Leather Boots, Wild Leather Leggings^^Give Jangdor's Letter to Una, the master leatherworker of Thunder Bluff.^<name>, you have learned all I am able to teach you. There is, however, one remaining pattern for Wild Leather armor. I will not require you to toil needlessly for this; you've earned it outright, and then some. This pattern, however, is one that I cannot freely share with you. My teacher, the one who brought me into the craft, is the one who must reward you. Take this note to Una; she teaches leatherworking in Thunder Bluff. Show her the letter, and let her acknowledge you as an equal, as I do.Tabetha's Task^46^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Ursyn Ghull^Tabetha^Tabetha's Task^^^Speak with Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.^Rumor is that Tabetha, a mage colleague who lives deep in Dustwallow Marsh, has a bone to pick with a certain sand troll in Zul'Farrak. If you speak with Tabetha she can tell you more. And bring some friends with you, <name>. If Tabetha has you go to Zul'Farrak then you're not going to want to go alone. You will find Tabetha's cottage west of Theramore, and just north of the Stonemaul Ruin.War on the Woodpaw^42^Horde^Feralas^Hadoken Swiftstrider^Hadoken Swiftstrider^War on the Woodpaw^^^Bring 10 Woodpaw Gnoll Manes to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.^The gnolls... they are more than a nuisance. They are a constant threat to the existence of this very camp! It is irrelevant whether they are indigenous to Feralas or not; if we do not strengthen our resolve against them, we will find ourselves driven out of the entire region. The gnoll attacks against the camp have become more fevered as of late. We need your aid in thinning their numbers; bring to me ten of their manes, and I will reward you handsomely for your effort. Go!Alpha Strike^43^Horde^Feralas^Hadoken Swiftstrider^Hadoken Swiftstrider^War on the Woodpaw^^^Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas and return to Hadoken Swiftstrider within one hour.^The plan is for various leaders of the gnolls - Alphas as they call themselves - to be taken down within rapid succession. If we're able to execute this sort of swift and precise devastation against them, it would cause chaos in their ranks. Perhaps it would also drive a message through their thick flea-bitten heads that we can and will destroy them! I want you to be the messenger of my will; eliminate five of their Alphas within one hour for this to work <name>, or we'll remain at this impasse!Tran'rek^45^All^Tanaris^Krazek^Tran'rek^Tran'rek^^^Speak with Tran'rek in Gadgetzan.^My cousin Tran'rek is in a tight spot. He promised me a load of scarab shells weeks ago and he hasn't delivered. He's my cousin, so I'd hate to have to send someone to Gadgetzan to break something on him. Can you speak to Tran'rek for me? Let him know he needs to get that delivery together before I do something rash? Gadgetzan is in northern Tanaris, in Kalimdor.Scarab Shells^45^All^Tanaris^Tran'rek^Tran'rek^Tran'rek^^^Bring 5 Uncracked Scarab Shells to Tran'rek in Gadgetzan.^The scarabs of Tanaris have very hard shells! Hard enough to use as a building material for lots of things. So many things! In fact, those shells are so useful... the scarabs were hunted all to near extinction! I know where there are more scarabs, and if you promise to bring me their shells then I'll tell you where they are. Promise? Ok, the scarabs have a colony in Zul'Farrak. I guess the trolls don't hunt them for their shells. But you can! Go to Zul'Farrak and get me uncracked shells!The Ruins of Solarsal^43^Alliance^Feralas^Shandris Feathermoon^Solarsal Gazebo^The Ruins of Solarsal^^^Explore the Ruins of Solarsal and investigate the presence of the naga there.^To our south are the Ruins of Solarsal; this is an area that far pre-dates modern times. We explored the ruins initially and found nothing of note; as such, we left it in peace. Very recently, the Hatecrest naga have occupied these ruins in alarming numbers. At first, we considered it as the precursor for an attack. Though that threat is still possible, we believe there might be something else going on. Go there, explore the ruins, and look for anything that stands out to you. Good luck, <name>.Return to Feathermoon Stronghold^43^Alliance^Feralas^Solarsal Gazebo^Shandris Feathermoon^The Ruins of Solarsal^^Against the Hatecrest^Return to Shandris Feathermoon in the Feathermoon Stronghold and report your findings.^With the discovery of the strange gazebo in the heart of the Ruins of Solarsal, the time has come to return to Feathermoon Stronghold and report to General Shandris Feathermoon what has been discovered here.Against the Hatecrest^43^Alliance^Feralas^Latronicus Moonspear^Latronicus Moonspear^Against the Hatecrest^^^Bring 10 Hatecrest Naga Scales to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold.^The best course of action at this point is to assume that, regardless of what the naga are up to, they will eventually move to secure the island for their own. We need to take aggressive steps to counter that threat before it is too late. Bring me ten Hatecrest Scales that are in good condition; it should be obvious to you how to acquire them. You'll cut your teeth on the naga for the first time, and we'll have a weakened naga presence on Sardor Isle - both are prospects that play to our advantage.Against Lord Shalzaru^45^Alliance^Feralas^Latronicus Moonspear^Latronicus Moonspear^Against the Hatecrest^^^Eliminate Lord Shalzaru, and then bring the Mysterious Relic he uncovered to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold.^<name>, new scouting reports have given us a good idea on the naga chain of command. Royalty is present amongst their rank and file, and they're the ones calling all the shots. Specifically, we've identified one of the crueler royals as Lord Shalzaru. Scouts report that he himself has uncovered an odd relic during a recent naga excavation in a cave south of the main ruins, across the water on the Isle of Dread. Put a stop to it by putting a stop to him, and bring me his relic so we can study it.Delivering the Relic^45^Alliance^Feralas^Latronicus Moonspear^Vestia Moonspear^Against the Hatecrest^^^Deliver the Mysterious Relic to Vestia Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold.^If you would be so kind as to deliver the relic to my wife Vestia, I would appreciate it. She's not only a fine priestess for our community, but she is one of the most well-versed scholars you'll find anywhere. I couldn't make heads or tails of this device even if there was a wager involved. My wife though, if anyone can figure out what this thing is, she could... and we need to know! She's just around the bend, no doubt studying. Thanks, <name>.Stoley's Debt^45^All^Tanaris^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^Stoley^Stoley's Debt^^^Speak with Stoley in Steamwheedle Port.^My old buddy Stoley owes me a very special bottle of rum. He tends the bar at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris, Kalimdor, and he promised me that the rum there is stronger than anything we can find in Booty Bay. He's so confident that he says if I try that rum and don't agree with him, then he'll double the money he owes me! Well, I think he's not as confident as he was when last we spoke, and now he's afraid to give me that rum. But I don't back down from wagers, so why don't you talk to him for me...Stoley's Shipment^45^All^Tanaris^Stoley^Stoley^Stoley's Debt^^^Bring Stoley's Shipment to Stoley in Steamwheedle Port.^I owe "Sea Wolf" MacKinley in Booty Bay some rum, to settle a bet, but I'm all out of rum! Captain Cuergo stole my last shipment, and he has it stowed in that walled pirate town to the south. If you can find my shipment of rum and return it to me, then I can prove to MacKinley that Kalimdor's booze beats the dirt out of Booty Bay!Deliver to MacKinley^45^All^Tanaris^Stoley^"Sea Wolf" MacKinley^Stoley's Debt^^^Bring Stoley's Bottle to "Sea Wolf" MacKinley in Booty Bay.^Thanks again for your help, <name>. Here's a bottle of Steamwheedle bilge rum. Take it to MacKinley and he can finally put to rest his crazy beliefs about Booty Bay booze.WANTED: Andre Firebeard^45^All^Tanaris^Wanted Poster^Security Chief Bilgewhizzle^^^^Bring Andre's Head to Security Chief Bilgewhizzle in Steamwheedle Port.^The vile pirate Andre Firebeard is wanted for crimes against Steamwheedle and Gadgetzan. By decree of governing counsel, any who read this are hereby authorized to use lethal force during the apprehension of Andre and his abettors. By further decree, should Andre be deceased, or otherwise indisposed, during the time of his hearing, his head may act as proxy, and deliverance of such head to Security Chief Bilgewhizzle constitutes a binding, and tenderable, contract.Ship Schedules^45^All^Tanaris^Ship Schedule^Security Chief Bilgewhizzle^^^^Report the Ship Schedules to an authority in Steamwheedle Port.^This scroll contains the schedules of shipments between Steamwheedle Port and Booty Bay. Both past and future shipments are included, along with ship names, with large 'X's next to some ships' journeys, and annotations like "GREAT LOOT" and "HARD FIGHT" next to others. Someone at Steamwheedle Port would want to see this document.Skulk Rock Clean-up^48^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Fraggar Thundermantle^Fraggar Thundermantle^^^^Kill 10 Green Sludges and 10 Jade Oozes, and then report back to Fraggar Thundermantle in Aerie Peak.^We Wildhammers remember the past, more than our brothers in Ironforge. If you want to make friends here, then you get your hands dirty for us! The Horde abandoned their positions in the Hinterlands around Skulk Rock; it's now overrun with nasty sludges and oozes. We've got plans on that area, but first we need a clean-up crew to make a hole for us. That's where you come in, Sunshine! Head down there and take out ten green sludges and ten jade oozes, then report back to me here. Move out!The Stave of Equinex^50^Alliance^Feralas^Troyas Moonbreeze^Equinex Monolith^The Stave of Equinex^Return to Troyas^^Energize Troyas' Stave and find the Equinex Monolith.^This stave might be the Stave of Equinex! The Stave of Equinex is actually a key, used to unlock the Equinex Monolith in the Ruins of Ravenwind, on the mainland west of the Dream Bough. Find the four flames that still burn in those ruins: Samha, Imbel, Byltan, and Lahassa. Retrieve their essence and then while standing by the Equinex Monolith, use the essences to energize the stave. If this is truly is the Stave of Equinex, you will be able to unlock the Monolith and gather a sacred artifact from it.Troll Necklace Bounty^45^All^The Hinterlands^Fraggar Thundermantle^Fraggar Thundermantle^^^^Bring 5 Troll Tribal Necklaces to Fraggar Thundermantle in Aerie Peak.^Get this straight, <race> - we are NOT part of the Alliance! The Wildhammers are independent, relying on deeds and actions to prove one's worth, rather than the blather of those who use jibber-jabber to bolster their do-nothing attitudes! If you're looking for friends here, then prove your worth to us first! The foul trolls that choke the hillsides of the Hinterlands sometimes carry tribal necklaces. Bring five of them to me, and we'll mark it down as a step in the right direction for you.Cuergo's Gold^45^All^^Cuergo's Treasure Map^Pirate's Treasure!^^^^Find Cuergo's gold!^This map shows a stretch of beach with a southern face. Below the map are words, elegantly written... South of WheedleSouth of homeFind a mast and flag and bonesDig you there, if you be boldDig and claim Cuergo's gold!A key you'll need and a key you'll seeThe men you face take blood as fee.Woodpaw Investigation^43^Horde^Feralas^Hadoken Swiftstrider^Woodpaw Battle Map^War on the Woodpaw^^^Find the gnoll battle plans somewhere in the gnoll camps to the south of Camp Mojache.^Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity. If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up. I want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans. They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them. Find them, and return to me when you have them.The Battle Plans^43^Horde^Feralas^Woodpaw Battle Map^Hadoken Swiftstrider^War on the Woodpaw^^Zukk'ash Infestation, Stinglasher^Bring the Woodpaw Battle Plans to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.^With the battle plans of the gnolls discovered, all that now remains is to bring the plans back to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache. Perhaps he or someone there can make further sense of what the gnolls are up to.A Fine Mess^30^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Kernobee^Scooty^^^^Escort Kernobee to the Clockwerk Run exit and then report to Scooty in Booty Bay.^<Kernobee groans.> Wha.. What happened? The last thing I remember is being captured by a group of dark iron dwarves, beaten to within an inch of my life and then thrown in here with these filthy troggs. Get me out of here, <name>! Here's the plan: Lead me to the exit; if we make it out alive, you go to Booty Bay and let Scooty know that I went to Ratchet to warn Tinkerwiz of the dark iron's involvement in the making of that super rig. Let's get going!Save Techbot's Brain!^26^Alliance^Ironforge^Tinkmaster Overspark^Tinkmaster Overspark^Tinkmaster Overspark^^^Bring Techbot's Memory Core to Tinkmaster Overspark in Ironforge.^When our beloved city Gnomeregan fell, a rogue spark must have jolted my poor creation, Techbot. It once aided me and my associates with its countless gizmos and limitless store of information, but its positronic brain has polarized. Now it's negatronic... and Techbot's behaviors are reversed. It roams Gnomeregan in a frenzy! But perhaps it can be salvaged. Perhaps, if you can retrieve Techbot's memory core and bring it to me, I can discover the cause of the polarization and fix my poor Techbot. Tinkmaster Overspark^26^Alliance^Ironforge^Brother Sarno^Tinkmaster Overspark^Tinkmaster Overspark^^^Speak with Tinkmaster Overspark in Ironforge.^Tinkmaster Overspark is very upset with the fate of his mechanical creation, Techbot. I remember Techbot as a kind and helpful tool for the gnomes, but Overspark tells me it's malfunctioned. Very sad. But with luck perhaps he can be fixed! Speak with Tinkmaster Overspark, in Tinker Town in Ironforge. He would welcome your help.Essential Artificials^30^Alliance^Ironforge^Klockmort Spannerspan^Klockmort Spannerspan^Klockmort's Essentials^^^Bring 12 Essential Artificials to Klockmort Spannerspan in Ironforge.^A nigh-universal mechanical component--the essential artificial--was of great use to the tinkers and smiths of Gnomeregan. But during the frantic exodus from our city, no one remembered to take any of these devices with them! And I need a large supply of them for work I will soon undertake. Please, go into Gnomeregan and get me some essential artificials. You'll find them in the deeper areas of our city, held in containers called artificial extrapolators. Thank you, <name>, and please hurry!Klockmort's Essentials^30^Alliance^Ironforge^Mathiel^Klockmort Spannerspan^Klockmort's Essentials^^^Speak with Klockmort Spannerspan in Ironforge.^A gnome friend, Klockmort Spannerspan, sent word to me from Ironforge. He tells me he needs help on a dangerous, but essential, mission into Gnomeregan, the once great gnome city now contaminated and filled with mad gnomes and their devices. I must stay here, but my heart aches to help my friend. If you can go in my stead, then I would be much indebted to you. You may find Klockmort in Tinkertown, in Ironforge.Gnogaine^27^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Ozzie Togglevolt^Ozzie Togglevolt^^The Day After^The Only Cure is More Green Glow^Use the Empty Leaden Collection Phial on Irradiated Invaders or Irradiated Pillagers to collect radioactive fallout. Once it is full, take it back to Ozzie Togglevolt in Kharanos.^Since the accident, all Gnoarn thinks about or talks about is cleansing Gnomeregan of the trogg infestation and finding a cure for the sickness that plagues it, <name>. Luckily, Razzle and I are close to some kind of cure - either that or the recipe for a really powerful rum. We won't know until we test! Naturally, in order to test our theory, we're going to need a few things; namely, fallout from the irradiated troggs in Gnomeregan. Fill up this phial with the green glow and bring it back!The Day After^27^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Gnoarn^Ozzie Togglevolt^^^Gnogaine^Speak with Ozzie Togglevolt at Kharanos in Dun Morogh.^You don't think I was always bald, do you? No <sir/ma'am>! It was the radiation leak in Gnomeregan that caused this tragic hair loss. Before that day, I had the only gnomefro in all of Azeroth. <Gnoarn shakes his fist in the air.> Damn those damned dirty troggs - damn them all!! Perhaps it's not too late, <name>. We may still be able to save it - the city I mean! Speak to Ozzie Togglevolt in Kharanos. He and his partner Razzle are working on a solution.Gyrodrillmatic Excavationators^30^Alliance^Stormwind City^Shoni the Shilent^Shoni the Shilent^^^^Bring twenty-four Robo-mechanical Guts to Shoni in Stormwind.^It's terrible, <name>. We are not going to have enough parts to get our fleet of gyrodrillmatic excavationators to Dun Morogh. What we need are spare parts, <name>. What better place to get the spare parts for our vehicles than Gnomeregan? I hear that bots and mechs roam around that place like cattle on an open range. What I need you to do is go to Gnomeregan and tear apart those robots. Bring me back their robot guts. Two dozen should be sufficient.The Grand Betrayal^35^Alliance^Ironforge^High Tinker Mekkatorque^High Tinker Mekkatorque^^^^Venture to Gnomeregan and kill Mekgineer Thermaplugg. Return to High Tinker Mekkatorque when the task is complete.^I trusted Thermaplugg, <race>. Never did I expect that he would betray me and the entire gnomish people. And for what? Power? Wealth? All things that he would have had in time. Now we have been displaced from our home and that madman is in charge. The king of nothing.... We will retake Gnomeregan, <name>. We will not stop until the city is back in our control. If you wish to join in our fight, a simple task I ask of you: Kill the betrayer. Destroy Mekgineer Thermaplugg.Data Rescue^30^Alliance^Ironforge^Master Mechanic Castpipe^Master Mechanic Castpipe^Castpipe's Task^^^Bring a Prismatic Punch Card to Master Mechanic Castpipe in Ironforge.^When we fled Gnomeregan, we left so much data behind! Vitally important data! I need the data on a prismatic punch card, from a Matrix Punchograph 3005-D high security terminal, deep in Gnomeregan. You must access the terminal, but to do that you first need clearance... and to get that you must access lower security terminals-- models -A, -B and -C. And to do THAT you need security punch cards, starting with white... and we left all the punch cards in the city. It's a catastrophe! Can you help?Castpipe's Task^28^Alliance^Ironforge^Gaxim Rustfizzle^Master Mechanic Castpipe^Castpipe's Task^^^Speak with Master Mechanic Castpipe in Ironforge.^Master Mechanic Castpipe in Ironforge has need of adventurers! He's organizing bands to reenter Gnomeregan on a data retrieval mission of top security and importance. Castpipe might not be a member of the Enlightened Assembly of Arcanology, Alchemy and Engineering Sciences like I am, but he's still a smart gnome so if he thinks it's important, then by my calculations there's an eighty-four percent probability that it really is important! Those are good odds!Grim Message^42^All^The Hinterlands^Nimboya^Nimboya^^^^Gather Witherbark Skulls and place on Nimboya's Pike. Place Nimboya's Laden Pike at one of the Witherbark Villages in the Hinterlands, then return to Nimboya in Stranglethorn.^The Witherbark trolls were once allies to the Horde, but they betrayed Thrall... and that must be punished! Here, take my pike and go to the Hinterlands, far to the north. You will find it northeast of Tarren Mill, a village held by our allies, the Forsaken. When you enter the Hinterlands, hunt Witherbark trolls. Gather their skulls and drive my pike into the ground at one of their smaller villages, Hiri'watha or Zun'watha. Show them their vile actions are of consequence!Venom Bottles^43^Horde^The Hinterlands^Venom Bottle^Apothecary Lydon^Venom Bottles^^^Bring a Venom Bottle to an apothecary in Tarren Mill.^These bottles hold a vile, green venom. Considering the number of bottles in this village, the Witherbarks must deem it very important. Perhaps an apothecary in nearby Tarren Mill would like a sample.Undamaged Venom Sac^45^Horde^The Hinterlands^Apothecary Lydon^Apothecary Lydon^Venom Bottles^^^Bring an Undamaged Venom Sac to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^I must have a fresh sample of the venom you brought me. The spiders from which it was gathered must dwell in the Hinterlands -- hunt them until you find an undamaged venom sac and bring it to me. You will find many spiders near the troll city of Shadra'Alor. Do not tarry, <name>, for the venom sac must be fresh when you deliver it.Consult Master Gadrin^45^Horde^The Hinterlands^Apothecary Lydon^Master Gadrin^Venom Bottles^^^Speak with Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village.^The venom from the broodguards wasn't as potent as the venom you brought originally. It must have come from a different spider. I want a fresh sample of that venom. To find out where it came from, you must consult with a troll who knows the Witherbark well--Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village. Travel to Durotar and speak with Gadrin. With luck, he'll know where the Witherbarks get their venom.The Spider God^45^Horde^Durotar^Master Gadrin^Master Gadrin^Venom Bottles^^^Read from the Tablet of Theka to learn the name of the Witherbark spider god, then return to Master Gadrin.^The Witherbarks worship a spider god, and from her they collect their most potent venom. So if you want the venom, then you must summon their god! To do that, you must know her true name, and that name is on a tablet buried in Tanaris, in the troll city of Zul'Farrak, in a tomb guarded by Theka the Martyr. Defeat Theka and find and read his tablet to discover the spider god's name. When you know it, return to me.Summoning Shadra^55^Horde^The Hinterlands^Master Gadrin^Apothecary Lydon^Venom Bottles^^Venom to the Undercity^Defeat Shadra at the altar of Shadra'Alor, then bring her venom to Apothecary Lydon in Tarren Mill.^Take his parchment, and read it at the altar of Shadra'Alor, deep within the witherbark realm in the Hinterlands. This will summon Shadra the spider god.Venom to the Undercity^55^Horde^The Hinterlands^Apothecary Lydon^Master Apothecary Faranell^^Summoning Shadra^^Bring Faranell's Parcel to Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity.^The venom you gathered from the Witherbark's spider god is quite a find! I've been able to kill nearly two dozen rabbits with just a drop of the stuff. Granted, some of those rabbits were very young and small enough to fit in the palm of one's hand so I'm certain their resistance to toxins was low, but it can't be denied that this poison is powerful! I'd like a sample sent to my superior, Apothecary Faranell in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. I am positive he would want to test this himself.In Search of Knowledge^47^Alliance^Feralas^Troyas Moonbreeze^Daryn Lightwind^^^Feralas: A History^Talk to Daryn Lightwind in Rut'theran Village.^While the ruins of Feralas can be quite dangerous, they have much to tell of what has happened here. Searching through the rubble to the south a few days ago, I discovered what appears to be a normal stave. However, I just can't shake the feeling that there is something more to it. Angelas and I have been poring over our books here, but we can't find a thing about it. I have a colleague in Darnassus that may be able to tell us what this is, <name>. Why don't you go talk to her and see if she can help us?Feralas: A History^47^Alliance^Feralas^Feralas: A History^Daryn Lightwind^Feralas: A History^In Search of Knowledge^^Ask Daryn Lightwind if you may borrow her book.^This book looks as if no one has opened it for quite a long time. Its covers are quite worn, and its pages yellowed, but after examining it, you notice that it might be just what Troyas is looking for. You pick it up, but realize you should probably ask before borrowing it.The Borrower^48^Alliance^Feralas^Daryn Lightwind^Curgle Cranklehop^Feralas: A History^^^Take the letter to Curgle Cranklehop in Tanaris.^I have studied many subjects in my time, and my latest fascination is with the snapjaw that occupy the beach in the Hinterlands. There's one in particular I'd like to see, a giant snapjaw named Gammerita. I'd like to go myself, but my research keeps me here. I think a picture of her would be the next best thing. Take this letter to Curgle Cranklehop in Tanaris. She has created an invention for me that can capture a picture. She called it a "snapshot," I think...The Morrow Stone^50^Alliance^Feralas^Equinex Monolith^Troyas Moonbreeze^The Stave of Equinex^^^Return the Sparkling Stone and the Stave of Equinex to Troyas Moonbreeze in Feathermoon Stronghold.^The moment the artifact is removed from the Monolith, you feel the energy in the Stave of Equinex begin to fade.Return to Troyas^48^Alliance^Feralas^Daryn Lightwind^Troyas Moonbreeze^Feralas: A History^^The Stave of Equinex^Deliver the book to Troyas Moonbreeze in Feathermoon Stronghold.^Here it is, <name>. Please, take care of my book. Now, hurry along. I'm sure Troyas is eager for your return.The Super Snapper FX^48^Alliance^Feralas^Curgle Cranklehop^Daryn Lightwind^Feralas: A History^^^Use the Super Snapper FX to take a snapshot of Gammerita, then return to Daryn Lightwind in Rut'theran Village.^Have the first look at my new invention, <name>. All you need to do is target whatever it is you'd like to take a picture of, and push the button. What was that creature from the Hinterlands that you mentioned? Gammerita? Well, good luck finding her. I'm sure Daryn will be quite pleased with the snapshot you return to her. In any case, here's the Super Snapper. Have fun!Grime-Encrusted Ring^34^All^^Grime-Encrusted Ring^The Sparklematic 5200^^^Return of the Ring, Return of the Ring^Figure out a way to remove the grime from the Grime-Encrusted Ring.^You have uncovered what appears to be a ring from the corpse of one of the Dark Iron dwarves. It is difficult to tell what kind of ring it is, however; dirt and hardened residue cake the item completely, making wearing it impossible. You think you can make out the slight luster of precious metal and maybe even the glint of a gem under the residue. If you are going to make use of this ring, you are going to need to find something to get the hardened residue off of it.Seeing What Happens^50^Alliance^Ironforge^Historian Karnik^Uldum Pedestal^Portents of Uldum^^The Stone Watcher^Bring the miniature platinum discs to the gates of Uldum in Tanaris and look for clues as to the connection between the two.^We want you to take the miniature discs you found to the sealed gates of Uldum. We... we aren't sure what will happen when you do this. This sounds risky, sure, we acknowledge that. It might, however, do nothing. You might need to use the discs on something. Perhaps the doors unlock when you have the discs in your possession. Be open to try anything, and be ready for anything to happen. When you've found out what happens, return to Ironforge. We'll have a lot to analyze when you're done!Return of the Ring^34^Alliance^Ironforge^The Sparklematic 5200^Talvash del Kissel^Return of the Ring^Grime-Encrusted Ring^^You may either keep the ring, or you may find the person responsible for the imprint and engravings on the inside of the band.^Opening the box produced by the Sparklematic 5200 reveals what you had suspected - a shiny ring! Wearing the ring, you feel magic power surge through you body. Inside the band is a small but nonetheless discernable imprint of the seal of Ironforge. Next to that, three small initials are engraved: "TdK". This may signify either the initials of the previous owner, or perhaps the initials of the ring's crafter. Keep the ring... or return it to this person. Decisions, decisions...Gnome Improvement^35^Alliance^Ironforge^Talvash del Kissel^Talvash del Kissel^Return of the Ring^^^Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge.^Listen <name>, that ring is yours, sure... but I can make you a better one! That design, like I said, is really simple. I am a lot more skilled now, and for the mere fee of thirty silver coins I'll spruce it up for you! Well, a little more than thirty, actually... I'm in a tight spot right now; all my material stock is all dried up. If you bring me a bar of silver and a moss agate, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will give it a little more pizzazz! Trust me!Return of the Ring^34^Horde^Orgrimmar^The Sparklematic 5200^Nogg^Return of the Ring^Grime-Encrusted Ring^^You may either keep the ring, or you may find the person responsible for the imprint and engravings on the inside of the band.^Opening the box produced by the Sparklematic 5200 reveals a shiny ring! Donning the ring, you feel magic power surge through your body. Inside the band is a small but nonetheless discernable imprint of the seal of Orgrimmar. Engraved letters are next to it, but only the first three stand out even after cleaning: "NOG..." This may signify either the initials of the previous owner, or perhaps the initials of the ring's crafter. Keep the ring... or find "NOG" - decisions, decisions...Nogg's Ring Redo^35^All^Orgrimmar^Nogg^Nogg^Return of the Ring^^^Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to Nogg in Orgrimmar.^No, no, no - I'm not all of the sudden saying that the ring is mine. I normally don't do this, but your information about the Dark Irons was very useful. I'll improve your ring for you, better than whomever made this simple little thing could have ever done. Probably some gnome... If you bring me a bar of silver, a moss agate, and thirty silver coins for my trouble, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will strengthen the magic inside of it. Interested?The Sparklematic 5200!^30^All^Dun Morogh^The Sparklematic 5200^The Sparklematic 5200^^^The Sparklematic 5200!^Insert a Grime-Encrusted Item into the Sparklematic 5200, and be sure to have three silver coins to start the machine.^This contraption stands out amongst the gnomes holding out against the madness outside the room. A small plaque on the device reads "The Sparklematic 5200", followed by some text: "Grime and residue ruining your sparklies? The Sparklematic 5200 puts the shine back in shine-tastic! Insert the item you wish to clean and deposit three silver coins in the coin slot. Give the Sparklematic 5200 a moment for operation, and voila! Your valuables will emerge clean and shiny!"The Stone Watcher^50^All^Tanaris^Stone Watcher of Norgannon^Uldum Pedestal^^^Return to Thunder Bluff, Return to Ironforge^Learn the purpose of the Stone Watcher of Norgannon, and then interact with the Uldum Pedestal in the Tanaris desert.^"Salutations - I am a guardian of entry. Unless you have the Plates of Uldum already integrated with your disc set, I will not allow for entry into the Uldum compound." The appearance of the Stone Watcher of Norgannon must be the reaction that was hoped for in sending you out to the Tanaris desert with the platinum discs. As instructed, you will need to find out what the story behind the Stone Watcher is before continuing on.The Only Cure is More Green Glow^30^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Ozzie Togglevolt^Ozzie Togglevolt^^Gnogaine^^Travel to Gnomeregan and bring back High Potency Radioactive Fallout. Be warned, the fallout is unstable and will collapse rather quickly.^Not only was your sample insufficient in quantity, it was also impure. What we require is more green glow. The troggs are obviously not irradiated sufficiently to fulfill our needs. You will have to go into Gnomeregan and bring back some radioactive fallout, straight from the tap. I am speaking of the irradiated slimes, lurkers and horrors. Be warned, the containment of this type of fallout is difficult. You may need to make several attempts with the phial until a suitable sampling is recovered.Portents of Uldum^50^Alliance^Ironforge^High Explorer Magellas^Historian Karnik^Portents of Uldum^The Platinum Discs^^Speak with Historian Karnik in the Hall of Explorers within Ironforge.^Greetings once again, <name>! Your discovery inside Uldaman has set the Explorers' League abuzz with excitement. The League has been working to unlock the secrets of the miniature platinum discs you found. Your fortuitous arrival here in the Hall allows me to share with you that we are quite possibly on to something! Historian Karnik has uncovered some important clues as to the true origins of the Valley of the Watchers in the Tanaris desert. He would like to speak with you as soon as possible!A Future Task^50^Alliance^Ironforge^Historian Karnik^High Explorer Magellas^Return to Ironforge^^^Speak with High Explorer Magellas in Ironforge.^Well <name>... we seem to be at a temporary dead end here. We know what we need - the Plates of Uldum - but we have no idea where they might be. We'll need to do quite a bit of research on this to come up with a solid plan of attack. I have a couple ideas where to start looking; I have high hopes that soon, we'll be asking you to head out and recover them. The High Explorer needs to be informed on this, <name>; no doubt, he also wants to thank you personally for once again aiding the League.Portents of Uldum^50^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Sage Truthseeker^Nara Wildmane^Portents of Uldum^The Platinum Discs^^Speak with Nara Wildmane on the Elder Rise in Thunder Bluff.^Ah, <name>, it is fortuitous that you have come to me again. Your revelations at the Uldaman dig site have certainly given us sages much discuss. I was doing just that with one of the druids, Nara Wildmane, when it dawned on me that her past adventuring experiences may have some great importance as to the next step we need to take. I would like for you to speak with her concerning her travels to the Valley of the Watchers in the Tanaris desert. She waits for you on the Elder Rise.Seeing What Happens^50^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Nara Wildmane^Uldum Pedestal^Portents of Uldum^^The Stone Watcher^Bring the miniature platinum discs to the gates of Uldum in Tanaris and look for clues as to the connection between the two.^Sage Truthseeker and I would like you to take the miniature discs you found to the sealed gates of Uldum. We... we aren't sure what will happen when you do this. This sounds risky, sure, we acknowledge that. It might, however, do nothing. You might need to use the discs on something. Perhaps the doors unlock when you have the discs in your possession. Be open to try anything, and be ready for anything to happen. Learn what you can, then return to me. We will have much to discuss.Return to Thunder Bluff^50^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Uldum Pedestal^Nara Wildmane^Return to Thunder Bluff^The Stone Watcher^^Speak with Nara Wildmane in Thunder Bluff.^You access the pedestal again; the platinum discs suddenly appear once more in your backpack. With the knowledge of the stone watcher learned and the discs returned to your possession, the time has come to return to Thunder Bluff and inform the Nara Wildmane of your discovery.A Future Task^50^Horde^Thunder Bluff^Nara Wildmane^Sage Truthseeker^Return to Thunder Bluff^^^Speak with Sage Truthseeker in Thunder Bluff.^Well <name>... we seem to be at an unfortunate impasse. We know what we need - the Plates of Uldum - but we have no idea where they might be. We will research this, and then devise a solid plan of attack. I have a couple ideas where to start looking; I have high hopes that soon, we'll be asking you to rejoin our efforts to discover the truth. Sage Truthseeker needs to be informed on this, <name>; no doubt, he also wants to thank you personally for once again heeding the call.Freedom for All Creatures^47^Alliance^Feralas^Kindal Moonweaver^Kindal Moonweaver^^^Doling Justice^Using the Bamboo Cage Key, free the Sprite Darters from the pen in the Grimtotem camp. At least 6 Sprite Darters and Kindal Moonweaver must survive.^The filthy Grimtotem clan are capturing faerie dragons, <name>. Jer'kai and I have no idea what they plan on doing with them, but they're obviously up to no good. We're not powerful enough to fight our way into the camp and free the captured dragons, but perhaps with your help... If you're willing, and you have some strong friends, release the creatures from their cage with this key and make sure they escape with their lives. I'll be by your side the entire time. Jer'kai will remain here.Doling Justice^47^Alliance^Feralas^Jer'kai Moonweaver^Jer'kai Moonweaver^^Freedom for All Creatures^Doling Justice^Kill 12 Grimtotem Naturalists, 10 Grimtotem Raiders, and 6 Grimtotem Shamans before returning to Jer'kai Moonweaver in Feralas.^As she's already told you, Kindal and I will now take the fight to the Grimtotem. Together, we should still be able to pick off some of the tauren without much threat to ourselves, but we'd love some help if you're willing and able. You've seen the camp below us, but there are more to the east. Using your own tactics, deal as much damage to the tauren as you can. We can all meet back here after they've felt the sting of Kindal's arrows and your own weapons.Doling Justice^47^Alliance^Feralas^Jer'kai Moonweaver^Tyrande Whisperwind^^Doling Justice^An Orphan Looking For a Home^Take Jer'kai's Signet Ring to High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus.^Out here in the wilderness, Kindal and I have meager means to reward your help, but we don't want you to feel unappreciated. Take my signet ring. If you ever find yourself in the boughs of Teldrassil, go to the Temple of the Moon in the heart of Darnassus. There you will find my High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind. The ring will let her know that we are well and give credit to your story. We both thank you, <name>.A New Cloak's Sheen^45^Horde^Feralas^Krueg Skullsplitter^Krueg Skullsplitter^A New Cloak's Sheen^^^Bring 10 Iridescent Sprite Darter Wings to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache.^Well met, <class>. I've traveled with my companions down to the Feralas on a mission for our Orgrimmar masters. My life-mate Korrin finds great pleasure in new clothing, so I aim to make her a new cloak adorned with the gossamer wings of faerie dragons. Would you be able to help me? Sprite darters with gorgeous wings I want are west of Camp Mojache.A Grim Discovery^45^Horde^Feralas^Krueg Skullsplitter^Krueg Skullsplitter^A New Cloak's Sheen^^^Bring 20 Grimtotem Horns to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache.^What!? You came across tauren in the area? You're joking! What did they look like!? The Grimtotem clan! You found some of them? Belgrom, one of our masters, has an interest in their kind... he's even put a bounty on them. You have to go back, <class>. Go back and bring me their horns... piles of them if you can. The Grimtotem are not to be trifled with or underestimated. Go back and slay them; let the rivers in Feralas run red with their dark blood.The Ogres of Feralas^43^Horde^Feralas^Rok Orhan^Rok Orhan^A Threat in Feralas^^^Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache wants you to kill 10 Gordunni Ogres, 10 Gordunni Ogre-Magi, and 5 Gordunni Brutes.^The effects of the Gordunni Ogre tribe can hardly go unnoticed in this area. Look around, <name>; their very presence scars this land. We must push them back before they expand even further into Feralas. Follow the river north, and you will find their outpost. Decrease their numbers, <name>. We must show them that their kind is not wanted here.A Grim Discovery^45^Horde^Feralas^Krueg Skullsplitter^Belgrom Rockmaul^A New Cloak's Sheen^^^Bring the Crate of Grimtotem Horns to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar.^What?! Ah, so I did mention a bounty, didn't I? Well, that'll teach me to open my mouth, won't it? You did the work, so I suppose it is only right you reap the greatest reward from it. Take the horns, I'll have them put in a crate for you. Find Belgrom Rockmaul in the Valley of Honor, he'll want to know what you saw and he'll reward you for your hard work. Be well, <class>, and thank you again for everything you've done.Return to Ironforge^50^Alliance^Ironforge^Uldum Pedestal^Historian Karnik^Return to Ironforge^The Stone Watcher^^Speak with Historian Karnik in Ironforge.^You access the pedestal again; the platinum discs suddenly appear once more in your backpack. With the knowledge of the stone watcher learned and the discs returned to your possession, the time has come to return to Ironforge and inform the Explorers' League of your discovery.The Gordunni Scroll^43^Horde^Feralas^Gordunni Scroll^Rok Orhan^The Gordunni Scroll^^^Bring the Gordunni Scroll to Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache.^Picking up the soiled scroll, you notice that it seems to be depicting some sort of meeting or ceremony. Rok Orhan would be interested in this scroll, and what it might mean to the Gordunni.Dark Ceremony^46^Horde^Feralas^Rok Orhan^Rok Orhan^The Gordunni Scroll^^^Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache wants you to find a Gordunni Orb.^These seem to be plans for some sort of dark ceremony, <name>. From what I can make out, this ritual is conducted by the Gordunni mage-lords. Find one of these mage-lords, and from him, gather an orb. The orb of a mage contains great power, and will help us discover more about this ceremony and the magic that the Gordunni wield.The Ogres of Feralas^44^Horde^Feralas^Rok Orhan^Rok Orhan^A Threat in Feralas^^^Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache wants you to kill 10 Gordunni Shaman, 10 Gordunni Warlocks, and 5 Gordunni Maulers.^Now that you have proven that you are a true fighter, I trust that you possess the courage to continue with the task at hand. Travel to the High Wilderness, southwest of here. There lie some abandoned and destroyed structures, on land that once belonged to the night elves. Look for these ruins, and when you see the withered trees and desecrated terrain, you will find the Gordunni. Push them back. These ogres are much stronger than the ones you faced previously, <name>. Be aware.A Threat in Feralas^43^Horde^Orgrimmar^Belgrom Rockmaul^Rok Orhan^A Threat in Feralas^^^Belgrom Rockmaul wants you to speak with Rok Orhan in Camp Mojache.^Feralas is an ideal location for an accomplished <class> to prove <himself/herself>. A tribe of ogres called the Gordunni are the dominant military force there, and their numbers are growing. They must be stopped before they threaten our presence in Feralas. A warrior I know of named Rok Orhan resides at Camp Mojache in Feralas; go to her. She will tell you more of the situation when you arrive.The High Wilderness^44^Alliance^Feralas^Angelas Moonbreeze^Angelas Moonbreeze^^^^Angelas Moonbreeze wants you to kill 8 Gordunni Warlocks, 8 Gordunni Shaman, and 8 Gordunni Brutes.^Although it is dangerous, Troyas and I have been investigating the ruins that cover the forests of Feralas. Lately, though, Troyas has been going on his own to the High Wilderness, and I really worry about him. The Gordunni Ogres have taken over that area, and they don't take kindly to anyone that enters their territory. I was hoping you might be willing to travel to the ruins to the southeast and clear out some of the ogres. Make it a little safer for my Troyas, and I will be extremely grateful.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Swart^Kranal Fiss^Call of Fire^^^Find Kranal Fiss in the Barrens.^It's been some time since you were tested last, <name>. You've been patient thus far in your studies, but it's time for you to learn about greater powers... it's time you learn real power. The element of fire is yours if you're prepared to pay for it. Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the blasted night elf lands, you've gone way too far.Call of Fire^10^Horde^Shaman^Narm Skychaser^Kranal Fiss^Call of Fire^^^Find Kranal Fiss in the Barrens.^Long has it been since you were last tested, <name>. You have shown patience thus far in your studies, but the time has come for you to learn more. The time has come for you to learn about destruction... and chaos. The element of fire is yours for the understanding, if you're prepared to pay for it. Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the night elf lands, you've gone too far.Call of Water^20^Horde^Shaman^Swart^Islen Waterseer^Call of Water^^^Find Islen Waterseer in the Barrens.^You look ready for your next test, <name>. You've been patient in your studies, but the time has come for you to learn more. The time has come for you to learn about the purity of water. Seek out Islen Waterseer in the Barrens. She is along the eastern coast, south of the Southfury River and Ratchet. You will find her there at her fishing hut. Good luck to you, <name>.Call of Water^20^All^Shaman^Narm Skychaser^Islen Waterseer^Call of Water^^^Find Islen Waterseer in the Barrens.^Long has it been since you were last tested, <name>.

Good luck to you, <name>.Gordunni Cobalt^43^Horde^Feralas^Orwin Gizzmick^Orwin Gizzmick^^^^Orwin Gizzmick in Camp Mojache wants 12 samples of Gordunni Cobalt.^I just arrived here in Feralas, and I've heard that the Gordunni Ogres that inhabit the wilds here have some interesting minerals. Who knows what they are up to, but they sure are protective of that stuff! They don't leave it just lying around; no, they bury it to protect folks like me from getting their hands on it. If you'd be willing, I'll give you my shovel. Go to the Gordunni Outpost north of here and dig me up some Gordunni cobalt. Look for the blue glow, then start digging!Witherbark Cages^45^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Witherbark Cages^^^Check the cages at the two Witherbark villages, then return to Gryphon Master Talonaxe.^The son of our mightiest gryphon is gone! Swiftwing's heir, Sharpbeak, was lost while hunting with his parents a few days ago, and we believe it was the trolls who took him. You must aid us! Search the cages in the two Witherbark troll villages to see if Sharpbeak is there.The Altar of Zul^48^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Witherbark Cages^^^Check the top of the Altar of Zul, then return to Gryphon Master Talonaxe.^Sharpbeak was not with the Witherbark trolls. Perhaps the Vilebranch trolls took him. Go to the Altar of Zul on the western edge of Vilebranch territory and search for the gryphon child.Thadius Grimshade^47^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Thadius Grimshade^Witherbark Cages^^^Bring Sharpbeak's Feather to Thadius Grimshade in the Blasted Lands.^Take this feather to Thadius Grimshade, the diviner. He left Aerie Peak years ago to pursue darker knowledge, but in his heart he is still a Wildhammer! And perhaps his talents can help us find Sharpbeak. This feather was taken from the nest where the gryphon child sleeps. If you give it to Thadius then, with luck, he can use his divining magics to find Sharpbeak. Good luck, <name>. You will find Thadius in the Blasted Lands, in the mage tower of Nethergarde Keep.Nekrum's Medallion^47^Alliance^Blasted Lands^Thadius Grimshade^Thadius Grimshade^Witherbark Cages^^^Bring Nekrum's Medallion to Thadius Grimshade in the Blasted Lands.^I'll find out where your gryphon is, but first you have to do something for me. There's a troll in Zul'Farrak, Nekrum Gutchewer, who possesses a medallion I would very much like to study. Bring me that Medallion and I'll use my powers to find Sharpbeak. Zul'Farrak is across the ocean to the west, in the desert of Tanaris.The Divination^47^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Thadius Grimshade^Thadius Grimshade^Witherbark Cages^^^Wait until Grimshade performs the ritual of divination.^Give me room while I perform a ritual of divination. I will find the connection between the feather you brought me and its owner, and follow that connection to Sharpbeak himself. That is... I will if all goes according to plan. If it does not, then... you better close your eyes.Return to the Hinterlands^47^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Thadius Grimshade^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Witherbark Cages^^^Speak with Gryphon Master Talonaxe.^Sharpbeak is held in a cage, high on a cliff at the top of Jintha'Alor in the Hinterlands. The key to this cage is possessed by the high priestess of the Vilebranch trolls, Vile Priestess Hexx. There. I have done my part. I bid you fortune on your quest, <name>.Saving Sharpbeak^51^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Gryphon Master Talonaxe^Witherbark Cages^^^Fight to the top of Jintha'Alor, kill Vile Priestess Hexx for the key to Sharpbeak's cage, and save Sharpbeak.^We must save Sharpbeak! Fight your way to the top of Jintha'Alor in the heart of Vilebranch territory, gain the key to Sharpbeak's cage from the vile Priestess Hexx, and then find and save Sharpbeak!Lines of Communication^47^Horde^Undercity^Oran Snakewrithe^Oran Snakewrithe^^^^Oran Snakewrithe in Undercity wants you to travel to the Hinterlands and burn the Highvale Records, Highvale Report, and Highvale Notes.^The Quel'Danil Lodge is a center of communication for the high elves of the Hinterlands. Their ambassadors are working to establish relationships with other races, with whom they share their knowledge of the Witherbark trolls that inhabit the area in the southern Hinterlands. All of the documents regarding the communications are kept at the lodge. We don't need the Highvale building alliances with others, <name>. Destroy the Highvale documents. We need to burn their lines of communication... literally.Seeking Strahad^30^Horde^Warlock^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Strahad Farsan^^^^Speak to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.^I have taught you skills in the past, but the time has come for another to teach you. He is in Ratchet, and his name is Strahad. He is human, but do not let that fool you into thinking he is weak. He is powerful even though he may be small. He can teach you about more powerful summonings--I feel you are ready. Go to him now. He is in Ratchet... above the port town next to his tower.Tome of Divinity^12^Dwarf^Paladin^Azar Stronghammer^Tiza Battleforge^^^The Tome of Divinity^Speak to Tiza Battleforge in Ironforge.^Hello, <name>.

I overheard him talking about how it was time you be put to the test some... along with some very complimentary things about how well you've performed thus far.

You can find her upstairs in the Hall of Mysteries which is located in the Mystic Ward.Seeking Strahad^30^Horde^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Strahad Farsan^^^^Find Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.^I have taught you skills in the past, but the time has come for another to teach you. He is in Ratchet, and his name is Strahad. He is human, but do not let that fool you into thinking he is weak, nor is he your enemy... at least for now. He is powerful and should be respected. He can teach you about greater summonings, summonings I feel you are prepared for. Go to him now.

Good luck.Dark Heart^50^Horde^Feralas^Talo Thornhoof^Talo Thornhoof^^^^Talo Thornhoof in Camp Mojache wants Edana Hatetalon's Dark Heart.^Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the Northspring harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. She is pure evil; I have heard that her heart is one of crystal. She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart. I have heard of a horn that harpies carry -- blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen. Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death.Vengeance on the Northspring^50^Horde^Feralas^Talo Thornhoof^Talo Thornhoof^^^^Talo Thornhoof wants you to kill 4 Northspring Harpies, 4 Northspring Roguefeathers, 4 Northspring Windcallers, and 4 Northspring Slayers.^In my day, I was a seasoned hunter. There wasn't any creature around that I feared. Until... I was out in the forest, sharpening my blade after a tough battle, when I was ambushed. Harpies surrounded me, and I barely managed to drag myself to safety. Even now, I can still hear their cries echoing... I was never the same after that. But the hate boils inside of me -- I must get even, after all these years. The Northspring harpies can be found to the west of here. <name>, get my revenge.Simple Tablet^1^Troll^Warrior^Gornek^Frang^^Cutting Teeth^^Read the Simple Tablet and speak to Frang in the Valley of Trials.^Ah, while you were gone a parchment came for you, <name>.

He has mixed up a concoction that I need for my... well, you'll see. Off with you now -- to Xerash. Here, take this with you. It's a shrunken head that I promised Xerash in exchange for the herbs. It's the head of some poor dwarf I ventured across in the forest. I'm sure he will be pleased.Return to Witch Doctor Uzer'i^45^Horde^Feralas^Xerash Fireblade^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^A Strange Request^^Testing the Vessel^Deliver Xerash's Herb Pouch to Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Feralas.^Here are the herbs, <name>.

Take this vessel, <name>. With it, you will have the power to shrink and capture a creature inside of it. Travel to the wilderness east of here and look for beasts. The vicious, ironfur bears and longtooth runners are your targets, <name>. Kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape.Hippogryph Muisek^47^Horde^Feralas^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Testing the Vessel^^^Kill 10 Frayfeather Hippogryphs of any type, then use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture them.^Since you have proven that you are both trustworthy and gifted with the ability to use the muisek vessel, I now wish you to capture another creature. Hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the night elves for many years; their spirits are loyal and steadfast. Your task is to kill 10 frayfeather hippogryphs, and quickly, shrink and capture them with the vessel, so that their muisek may be preserved. You will find the hippogryphs in the High Wilderness, to the south of here.Faerie Dragon Muisek^45^Horde^Feralas^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Testing the Vessel^^^Kill 8 Sprite Darters or Sprite Dragons. Use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen Faerie Dragons.^<name>, next I must have you capture a creature that in appearance, may look quite fragile, yet its powerful spirit is what we are truly after. The faerie dragons that I speak of have served the night elves as their allies. We must capture one so that the horde may benefit from this strength of spirit as well. Here is the muisek, <name>. Kill 8 sprite darters or sprite dragons, and capture their muisek. They may be found to the west of here.Treant Muisek^50^Horde^Feralas^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Testing the Vessel^^^Kill 3 Wandering Forest Walkers. Use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen Treants.^The wandering forest walkers that can be found meandering through the forest are our next target, <name>. Night elves have enlisted treants as allies to fight against the horde. Their movement may be slow, but their role as protectors is undeniable. Soon we will be able to use this power for our own benefit. Find 3 wandering forest walkers; kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them.Mountain Giant Muisek^50^Horde^Feralas^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Testing the Vessel^^Weapons of Spirit^Kill 7 Land Walkers or Cliff Giants. Use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen Mountain Giants.^The last task I will require of you is to travel to the northwest and find the final enemy. The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the burning legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain. I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek.Natural Materials^50^Horde^Feralas^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^^^Weapons of Spirit^Bring 2 Splintered Logs, 6 Encrusted Minerals, 20 pieces of Resilient Sinew, and 40 Metallic Fragments to Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Camp Mojache.^I will need certain materials to complete my endeavor... You may do this alongside the other tasks I will give you. I'll need a splintered log from a treant of Feralas. Encrusted minerals, these can be found on the mountain giants and faerie dragons to the west. Also, find me some resilient sinew from the owlbeasts of the Hinterlands or hippogryphs of Feralas. Finally, I'll need a large amount of metallic fragments from any of these creatures I mentioned.Weapons of Spirit^50^Horde^Feralas^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^^Mountain Giant Muisek, Natural Materials^^Witch Doctor Uzer'i wants you to wait for a moment while he prepares the weapons.^Imbuing the muisek into the weapons is a difficult process.

Please wait; I will return in a moment.Against the Hatecrest^43^Alliance^Feralas^Shandris Feathermoon^Latronicus Moonspear^Against the Hatecrest^Return to Feathermoon Stronghold^^Report to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold.^At this point, I am going to direct you to my second, Latronicus. He's been keeping a close eye on the naga forces to date. I'll assess the general situation here in regards to the naga; as much as I want to commit a full force to move against them, leaving the stronghold open to direct attack from the Horde - or worse - seems less than optimal. Anyway, Latronicus awaits. Good work thus far, <name>. Keep it up. You're dismissed.Loramus^57^All^Azshara^Loramus Thalipedes^Loramus Thalipedes^Kirith^^^Listen to Loramus Thalipedes tell his story.^So you wish to battle demons? You would do well to listen to my tale.Gahz'ridian^48^All^Tanaris^Marvon Rivetseeker^Marvon Rivetseeker^^^^Marvon Rivetseeker in Tanaris wants you to collect 30 Gahz'ridian Ornaments.^<name>, I'm a scientist, but also a treasure hunter at heart! Long ago, when trolls used to occupy this land, they created large amounts of ornaments modeled after Gahz'rilla, a hydra they worshipped as a deity. These ornaments are carved out of an element that I call "Gahz'ridian," after the hydra god. I did find some myself, but I'd like to have some more to study -- maybe you can find some? I even invented a detector that makes finding the Gahz'ridian a snap! Just put it on, and the search begins!The Horn of the Beast^43^Alliance^Searing Gorge^Margol's Horn^Mountaineer Pebblebitty^The Horn of the Beast^^^Take Margol's Gigantic Horn to Mountaineer Pebblebitty.^The gigantic horn has numerous scratches and cracks. An unusual metal object is lodged into the rough surface. Upon further examination, you notice that the metal is actually a broken axe head. On the metal, the following words are etched: Property of Mountaineer Pebblebitty. When you try and dislodge the broken axe head, it shatters into a million pieces. Woops!Proof of Deed^43^Alliance^Loch Modan^Mountaineer Pebblebitty^Curator Thorius^The Horn of the Beast^^At Last!^Take Margol's Gigantic Horn to Curator Thorius in Ironforge.^You expect me to believe a story like that? The real horn would have had my broken axe head still lodged into its surface. Listen, take that obvious fake to Curator Thorius in Ironforge. If he can validate your claim, you will receive a proof of deed. Bring that proof back to me and I'll give you the key to the Searing Gorge. Get going!At Last!^43^Alliance^Ironforge^Curator Thorius^Mountaineer Pebblebitty^^Proof of Deed^^Take the Proof of Deed back to Mountaineer Pebblebitty.^I can't believe Pebblebitty doubted the authenticity of the horn. Between you and me, I think she's just jealous. I know she really wanted to kill that beast herself, what with the 'incident' and all. So you need a proof of deed? After the contribution you just made to the museum, it won't be a problem. <Curator Thorius begins to fill out a large document.> There we go! You can take that back to Pebblebitty.Speak with Renferrel^12^All^Silverpine Forest^High Executor Hadrec^Apothecary Renferrel^Escorting Erland^^^Speak with Apothecary Renferrel at the Sepulcher.^While you were out helping our deathstalkers, Apothecary Renferrel sent you a summons.

To learn more, you must go to Camp Taurajo to the south and speak with Jorn Skyseer. He will continue your guidance.Stolen Silver^18^Horde^The Barrens^Gazrog^Gazrog^Raptor Thieves^^^Bring the Stolen Silver to Gazrog in the Crossroads.^You may have killed the raptors, but the silver they stole must be recovered! I have reports that the raptors have a large grouping of nests south of Ratchet, known as the Raptor Grounds. It is likely that they brought our stolen silver there. Go to this raptor haven and search for the stolen silver. When you find it, return it to me.Mura Runetotem^15^Horde^The Barrens^Tonga Runetotem^Mura Runetotem^^Altered Beings^^Speak with Mura Runetotem at the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest.^My clanmate, Mura Runetotem, traveled to Silverpine so that she might aid our undead allies. Silverpine is an ailing forest, a dying forest, and it was Mura's hope to bring it new life. Perhaps the strange life found here in the Barrens can help her work in Silverpine. Take a sample of the shells you gathered, and bring it to Mura in Silverpine. She is staying at the Sepulcher. With luck, studying the shell will give her the insight she needs to heal that dying place.Did You Lose This?^50^All^Blacksmithing^Trenton Lighthammer^Trenton Lighthammer^^A Good Head On Your Shoulders, The World At Your Feet, The Mithril Kid^^Wait for Trenton to finish his work.^You have done much for the Order, <name>. The sheer dedication it takes to get this far would have turned away any ordinary person. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of Galvan, that you are one of us. Which is why I think you deserve a little reward. It is nothing really, just a trinket. You may be familiar with its properties, as I do believe it is what brought you to us in the first place.Bring the End^37^Horde^Razorfen Downs^Andrew Brownell^Andrew Brownell^^^^Andrew Brownell wants you to kill Amnennar the Coldbringer and return his skull.^In the Barrens lies a horrid mess of tangled vines called Razorfen Downs. While our first observations of this place revealed little threat, our recent findings are much more serious... The quilboar of Razorfen Downs have aligned themselves with the Scourge. A Lich named Amnennar the Coldbringer rules them now, using the power of his massive consciousness to control their every move. Amnennar has a direct telepathic link to Ner'zhul; we must sever this bond, <name>. An end must come to the Coldbringer.A Refugee's Quandary^3^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Felix Whindlebolt^Felix Whindlebolt^^^^Bring Felix's Box, Felix's Chest and Felix's Bucket of Bolts to Felix Whindlebolt in Anvilmar.^We drove the troggs out of Gnomeregan, but then it all went so horribly wrong! Now our home is completely irradiated, and we gnomes have been scattered all over Dun Morogh. In my haste to get away from the radiation, I lost all my personal belongings and tools. It was the trolls that got them. They stole my chest, my box, and my bucket of bolts! They took them back to their camps southwest of Anvilmar. I'm no adventurer - could you find my things and bring them here to me, please?Thistleshrub Valley^50^All^Tanaris^Tran'rek^Tran'rek^^^^Tran'rek in Gadgetzan wants you to kill 8 Gnarled Thistleshrubs and 8 Thistleshrub Rootshapers.^Have you ever seen Thistleshrub Valley? It's a mighty dangerous place, <name>. Those strange beasts there, I don't trust them for a minute! Gnarled thistleshrubs and thistleshrub rootshapers, that's what I think they were called... Anyhow, I want to get into the valley, but with so many of those thistleshrubs around, there's no way I'm going back there. But here's where you come in -- if you clear some of them out, I just might think about going back. What do you think, <name>? Help me out?Scalding Mornbrew Delivery^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Nori Pridedrift^Durnan Furcutter^^^Bring Back the Mug^Take a Scalding Mornbrew to Durnan Furcutter inside Anvilmar before it gets cold!^Gah! I was supposed to get this delicious scalding mornbrew to Durnan Furcutter inside Anvilmar a while ago now, but I had to deliver one to Grelin here first. I'll never make it to Anvilmar before the brew runs cold! You look fast. Maybe you can make it. This cup will only stay hot for a few more minutes, and Durnan didn't order "chilly" mornbrew, so get going. Anvilmar is to the northeast, a settlement dug into the mountain. Thanks, <name>, and don't forget to bring me back my mug!Bring Back the Mug^5^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Durnan Furcutter^Nori Pridedrift^^Scalding Mornbrew Delivery^^Return Nori's Mug to Nori Pridedrift in Coldridge Valley.^Now that hit the spot!

He is in the Hall of Explorers.^Brother, If you are reading this letter, I am no more. How it got to you, I do not know, but thank and reward the ones responsible. About the stones: They exist and the Dark Irons have them in their possession. Their leader, Lathoric the Black, is using the power of the stones to enslave my excavation team. They were taken to the cauldron. Their minds are twisted, working night and day to complete something called Obsidion. Help them, brother. It is the final wish of a dead man. -DoriusIn Nightmares^25^Horde^The Barrens^Falla Sagewind^Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem^^The Glowing Shard^^Bring the Nightmare Shard to Hamuul Runetotem on Elder Rise.^This shard holds great secrets; it is the pure essence of the Emerald Dream. However, what I see in this shard is not a dream; one would call this sort of a vision a nightmare.

The loss of Dorius is not one that I will soon recover from. I must see his final wish through - the perpetrators of this cold blooded murder must be brought to justice. Return to the Searing Gorge and fulfill his last request: Free his men. The Dark Iron dwarves force their slaves to work in a sweltering mine called the Slag Pits. Search there for Dorius' men.Release Them^46^Alliance^Searing Gorge^Dying Archaeologist^Altar of Suntara^Suntara Stones^^Rise, Obsidion!^Find the Mysterious Artifact being guarded by the Twilight's Hammer Idolaters in the northwest quadrant of the Searing Gorge and bring it to the Altar of Suntara in the Slag Pit.^Release them, <race>.

"Mortal, heed this plea. I am Eranikus of the Green Dragonflight, keeper of this accursed temple. My charge to ensure that the trolls never again bring forth their abomination of a god has for now ended in failure. As I imbue this gem with part of my essence, I sense my grip on the Dream twisting into chaos. Please - place this gem into the essence font in my lair, and let our magic there purge the taint from my psyche so that I may rest."The Essence of Eranikus^55^All^Swamp of Sorrows^Oathstone of Ysera's Dragonflight^Itharius^^The Essence of Eranikus^In Eranikus' Own Words^Bring the Oathstone of Ysera's Dragonflight and the Chained Essence of Eranikus to Itharius in the Swamp of Sorrows.

"By accepting the charge placed in this Oathstone, you agree to aid my cause and the cause of Ysera's Dragonflight in redeeming the corrupted soul of Eranikus. The first sacrifice, one of many you and I will no doubt make, will be to relinquish the gem to me that has chained what free-willed part of Eranikus' psyche remains."

You're kidding, right? What did you do with the first one?! We have a lot of work ahead of us here, <race>. Those phials don't grow on trees! Actually, I wish they did, because I'd go there and pick one off since I don't have another one!! in order to make you one, I need the following: a mana potion, a piece of coal, and some sweet nectar. Don't ask why, just bring me what I ask and I'll make you a new one.Break Sharptusk!^5^All^Mulgore^Brave Windfeather^Brave Windfeather^^^^Bring the head of Chief Sharptusk Thornmantle to Brave Windfeather in Red Cloud Mesa.^<name> - I have heard of you, newcomer. Perhaps it is you that will help us, where others have failed. We tauren have carved a home out of this land, but not without a cost. The Bristleback quilboars of Brambleblade Ravine, led by Chief Sharptusk Thornmantle, have made our lives difficult with their continued war against us. I charge you to bring me the chief's head! He will be found in the ravine to the east in their makeshift village.Prayer to Elune^50^Alliance^Searing Gorge^Zamael Lunthistle^Zamael Lunthistle^Prayer to Elune^^^Hear Zamael tell his tale.^Will you assist me, mortal? Hear my tale.Prayer to Elune^50^Alliance^Searing Gorge^Zamael Lunthistle^Astarii Starseeker^Prayer to Elune^^^Find the Prayer to Elune and take it to Astarii Starseeker in Darnassus.^Will you assist me, mortal? Will you find the prayer to Elune? As I stated, the prayer was etched onto a golden tablet. One of these idol worshipping scoundrels must have it on their person. If you do recover my prayer, take it to Astarii Starseeker in Darnassus. It matters little that my faith has been rekindled after the countless malevolent actions that I have taken against this world and its inhabitants, but my prayer must be heard. Absolution is the last thing I expect.Shadoweaver^50^All^Tailoring^Nilith Lokrav^Nilith Lokrav^Shadoweaver^^^Kill the group of Shadow Silk Poachers that wander the Searing Gorge. Nilith has reason to believe that there are five of them that need to be exterminated. Return to Nilith in the Searing Gorge when this task is complete.^The spiders of the Searing Gorge are an invaluable source of shadow silk. As you know, shadow silk is highly sought after by the artisans of our trade. Recently, a group of poachers has encroached upon these lands, carelessly slaying spiders en masse without so much as a thought as to the long term effect of their actions. The first task I ask of you, then, is a simple one: Find them... and end them. Begin your search to the north. If you require assistance, speak with Raze.The Sunken Temple^51^Horde^Tanaris^Witch Doctor Uzer'i^Marvon Rivetseeker^The Sunken Temple^^The Stone Circle^Find Marvon Rivetseeker in Tanaris.^There are restless spirits in this world, <name>. There are spirits that have been tainted by their isolation, bound to an ancient evil... I have heard of a place that lies deep below the surface of the earth -- banished there by powers greater than I have ever seen. If you wish to learn more of this place; the Sunken Temple, seek out a goblin named Marvon Rivetseeker. He has studied many ancient areas of the world, and was last known to have left his home in Ratchet to study the troll ruins in Tanaris.A Crew Under Fire^57^All^Azshara^Captain Vanessa Beltis^Captain Vanessa Beltis^^^^Defend Captain Vanessa Beltis, her crew and the Horizon Scout's passengers against the naga attack. Captain Vanessa Beltis must survive.^We were just off the coast looking for a safe haven to make anchor. The sun hadn't been down for more than an hour when they attacked... those damned naga! I'm not sure what they were looking for, but it's clear they didn't find it--they've already come back once. A couple of my scouts are on watch at the entrance of the valley to give us fair warning when the next attack comes. I'm sorry you've come along now, <name>, but it's out of my hands. Are you ready for the fight of your life?The Undermarket^50^All^Tailoring^Nilith Lokrav^Nilith Lokrav^Shadoweaver^^^Slay Trade Master Kovic and his minion Clunk. Retrieve the Trader's Satchel from his corpse and return it to Nilith.^They call themselves the Undermarket: Cutthroat traders that will sell, move, trade and do just about anything for the right price. It gets worse, <name>. They have set up a base of operations here in the Searing Gorge. Trade Master Kovic is heading up the operation and has close ties with the Dark Iron dwarves of the region. We must strike hard and send a message to their leadership. Slay Trade Master Kovic and his minion Clunk. Bring back his trader's satchel when the job is done. To the Cauldron!The Undermarket^50^All^Tailoring^Nilith Lokrav^Vizzklick^Shadoweaver^^^Speak with Vizzklick in Gadgetzan.^I want you to personally deliver the news of Kovic's defeat to Vizzklick in Gadgetzan. He will be so happy to hear that Kovic is dead that I'm certain he'll give you some grand reward.Divine Retribution^48^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Kalaran Windblade^^^The Flawless Flame^Listen as Kalaran Windblade tells his story.^Hear my tale, adventurer.The Flawless Flame^48^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Kalaran Windblade^The Flawless Flame^Divine Retribution^^Collect 4 Hearts of Flame and 4 globes of Golem Oil and return the items to Kalaran Windblade.^You have made the right decision, <name>. We must strike where we will do the most damage: the four sentry towers. With the four towers in flames, we can initiate an offensive before they have time to react. You will need the proper tool to set the towers ablaze. To make the tool requires some materials. Bring me four hearts of flame and four golem oil and I shall craft the torch of flawless flame. The golems and elementals in these lands should be your first target.Forging the Shaft^48^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Kalaran Windblade^The Flawless Flame^^^Bring 8 Thorium Plated Daggers to Kalaran Windblade.^To hold the flawless flame, we will need a shaft and a casing. You must first find a suitable shaft. The Dark Iron taskmasters and slavers of the cauldron use weapons of enchanted thorium, an extremely sturdy alloy. If you bring me eight thorium plated daggers, I can break the alloy down and reforge a shaft.The Stone Circle^51^All^Tanaris^Marvon Rivetseeker^Marvon Rivetseeker^The Sunken Temple^^Into the Depths, Secret of the Circle^Retrieve the Stone Circle from Marvon Rivetseeker's workshop in Ratchet.^I once entered the foreboding chambers of the Sunken Temple. The evil in that place penetrates all that enter; I barely managed to find my way out, wading through the ooze that now covers the floors. All I can remember is stumbling through a large circular room, filled with serpent statues... Recently, I discovered a round stone that appeared to have the same serpent symbol imprinted on it. I had it packed up and shipped to my workshop in Ratchet. Retrieve it, and I might be able to tell you more.The Sunken Temple^51^Alliance^Feralas^Angelas Moonbreeze^Marvon Rivetseeker^The Sunken Temple^^The Stone Circle^Find Marvon Rivetseeker in Tanaris.^I have heard of a place that lies deep below the surface of the earth -- banished there by powers greater than I have ever seen. If you wish to learn more of this place; the Sunken Temple, seek out a goblin named Marvon Rivetseeker. Much like Troyas and I, he has studied many ancient areas of the world. He was last known to have left his home in Ratchet to study the troll ruins in Tanaris. Good luck finding him; he hasn't been heard from in some time.Into the Depths^51^All^^Marvon Rivetseeker^Altar of Hakkar^^The Stone Circle^^Find the Altar of Hakkar in the Sunken Temple in Swamp of Sorrows.^Inside the temple, I found a circular room with six balconies, each one with a serpent statue on the edge. Curious, I pushed one of them to see what would happen, and it was a trap! I nearly fell to my death from the explosion. Laying there on the ledge, I looked down and noticed that there was another statue at the base of the room; an altar of sorts... Hakkar, I think it was called. I think that this altar is the secret -- you must bring this token to the altar in the Sunken Temple.Secret of the Circle^51^All^^Marvon Rivetseeker^Idol of Hakkar^^The Stone Circle^^Travel into the Sunken Temple and discover the secret hidden in the circle of statues.^My memories are cloudy, but I will tell you what I can. The circle of statues in the Sunken Temple, while dangerous, I believe that they hold the secret to unlock an even greater treasure. From the main altar, I was able to activate a series of lights. I think that if you can uncover what these lights mean, you might be able to unlock whatever secrets are hiding in this room. I warn you though, <name>. Great evil lies in the temple. It's likely that anything valuable will be fervently guarded...Passing the Burden^52^Alliance^Ironforge^Historian Karnik^Tymor^Passing the Burden^^An Easy Pickup^Speak to Tymor in Ironforge.^I've recently been handed the responsibility of investigating Azshara--a once beautiful area the elves called home. This would be back when they practiced magic. It's now a more dangerous place than it is beautiful, but that doesn't stop us from turning over every stone for answers to our past. A companion of mine named Tymor offered to help me investigate the area since he takes a particular interest in such things. He owns a small place to the right of the Hall of Mysteries here in the city.Arcane Runes^52^Alliance^Ironforge^Tymor^Pilot Xiggs Fuselighter^Passing the Burden^^^Using the Drawing Kit, make rubbings of the Rune of Beth'Amara, the Rune of Jin'yael, the Rune of Markri, and the Rune of Sael'hai before heading to the small island off of the southern peninsula of Azshara and signaling Pilot Xiggs Fuselighter to pick them up.^Magic was once as revered as Elune herself to some elves. Some of their most powerful mages created runes and tablets citing rules of the arcane and insights into their findings. They would leave these for all to ponder in public places. I would very much like rubbings of these runes from the Ruins of Eldarath. I have a kit for you to make the rubbings with, but it will be up to you to find them. Be careful though, the Explorer's League isn't the only one interested in Eldarath.An Easy Pickup^52^Alliance^Ironforge^Tymor^Xiggs Fuselighter^An Easy Pickup^Passing the Burden^^Speak to Xiggs Fuselighter in Ironforge.^I want the rubbings delivered to my tower, but there's no need to have you go all the way there. I'll just have them air-lifted out of Azshara. Xiggs Fuselighter owes me a favor or two and will be in the area soon--he's signed on to patrol the coast. Speak to him before you leave. He can give you a flare gun to signal him with. When you have the rubbings, just head to wherever he tells you and then give them to him so he can get them to my tower safely. He should be in the hangar in the Military Ward.Signal for Pickup^52^Alliance^Ironforge^Xiggs Fuselighter^Xiggs Fuselighter^An Easy Pickup^^Signal for Pickup^Speak to Xiggs Fuselighter and get a Standard Issue Flare Gun from him in Ironforge.^Ah, so Tymor sent you, huh? Yeah, I owe him a favor or two. What's that? Why, that little devil. Yeah, I can help him out with that. So you'll need a flare gun and a location... easy enough. There's a small island off the southern peninsula of Azshara that we've made a landing pad on. You take this flare gun, and use it there. I'll see your signal and come by to pick up this... whatever it is he wants.The Flame's Casing^50^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Kalaran Windblade^The Flawless Flame^^^Find and return a Symbol of Ragnaros to Kalaran Windblade.^We need one final piece to form the torch. In the mountains to the northwest you will find a large encampment of Twilight's Hammer. It is rumored that they carry symbols and idols that pay homage to their god. These symbols and idols could carry sufficient enchantment to form a magical casing. Bring me a single symbol of Ragnaros and I will try to extract the magic from the item to create the casing.The Torch of Retribution^50^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Kalaran Windblade^The Flawless Flame^^^Wait for Kalaran Windblade to complete the Torch of Retribution.^Give me a moment to combine the pieces and apply the necessary enchantments.The Torch of Retribution^50^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Torch of Retribution^The Flawless Flame^^Squire Maltrake^Take the Torch of Retribution.^The torch must now be bound to its owner. Pick up the torch, <name>.Return to Tymor^52^Alliance^Ironforge^Pilot Xiggs Fuselighter^Tymor^Passing the Burden^^^Return Tymor's Drawing Kit to him in Ironforge.^Tymor didn't give me anything to pay you with, so I suggest you take it up with him when you get back to Ironforge. I'm sure he'll still be in his place in the Mystic Ward. Just go knockin' and make sure he pays you good. This place ain't no picnic... that's for sure. Thanks again for helping him out though, and good luck. Oh, and I don't need the drawing kit. Why don't you just bring it back to Tymor when you go to see him?Squire Maltrake^50^All^Searing Gorge^Kalaran Windblade^Squire Maltrake^Squire Maltrake^The Torch of Retribution^^Speak with Squire Maltrake.^Speak with my envoy, Squire Maltrake. He will further instruct you as to the use of the Torch of Retribution.Set Them Ablaze!^52^All^Searing Gorge^Squire Maltrake^Squire Maltrake^Squire Maltrake^^Trinkets...^Set the North, South, East, and West Sentry Towers on fire by using the Torch of Retribution inside each of the buildings.^Listen well, <name>. While the four towers can never be destroyed, you can use the torch of retribution to set them ablaze for a very long period of time: A fire that no element or force can subdue. While they are ablaze, no guard or sentry unit can inhabit the watch posts and thus, their first line of defense is nullified. You must enter each tower and use the Torch of Retribution within their fortifications. Beware the lookouts posted by the Dark Irons, <name>.Trinkets...^50^All^Searing Gorge^Hoard of the Black Dragonflight^Hoard of the Black Dragonflight^^Set Them Ablaze!^A Taste of Flame^Open the chest.^The chest appears locked.Everything Counts In Large Amounts^55^All^Blasted Lands^Kum'isha the Collector^Kum'isha the Collector^Everything Counts In Large Amounts^^^Bring Kum'isha Imperfect Draenethyst Fragments and be rewarded for each one you turn in.^Although you may never find a flawless sphere of draenethyst, you will undoubtedly uncover various imperfect fragments of the draenethyst in your exploration of these lands. While it is doubtful that Kum'isha will be able to use the flawed fragments to return home, the pieces may serve other, useful purposes for the draenei. Return any piece of flawed draenethyst fragments that you may find and I shall reward you.One Draenei's Junk...^55^All^Blasted Lands^Kum'isha the Collector^Kum'isha the Collector^Everything Counts In Large Amounts^^^Bring Kum'isha Imperfect Draenethyst Fragments. Any form of monster in the Blasted Lands could be carrying a fragment.^Well, after that display of voracious greed, I feel nauseous. Regardless, I shall not dwell too long on your material addiction. For each imperfect draenethyst fragment you turn in, I shall reward you with more junk. My junk heap gets smaller while your junk heap gets larger. On Draenor we call this a 'win-win' situation.Betrayed^53^All^Orgrimmar^Belgrom Rockmaul^Ag'tor Bloodfist^Betrayed^^^Deliver the Sealed Letter to Ag'tor to Ag'tor Bloodfist in Azshara.^Betraying, thieving woman! That's what I call her--that's all she'll ever be! I may have made a grave mistake, <name>. I trusted a blood elf. What's worse, I trusted a woman! She claimed Azshara would hold great riches... powerful items. I simply send some warriors with her to protect her and I would be rewarded. Well, look who's the fool--she's killed them all. I want vengeance, <name>, but I can't afford to send anyone else. Find Ag'tor at Valormok, north of the Haldarr Encampment. He'll tell you more.Betrayed^53^All^Orgrimmar^Ag'tor Bloodfist^Kaldorei Tome of Summoning^Betrayed^^^Kill 10 Blood Elf Reclaimers, and 10 Blood Elf Surveyors before seeking out Magus Rimtori's camp. Once you've found it, look for something that might be important to her that can be used to draw her into a fight.^I thought as much. We start our crusade against her workers along the southern bluffs on the northern peninsula of Azshara. Kill them with bloody rage--let them know they've betrayed the wrong allies. Do not concern yourself with her yet--she spends most of her time with her bodyguards searching Azshara. It would be prudent after you've slain her workers to find her personal camp. Scouting out where we can attack her would be wise. Perhaps there is something there we can use to provoke her.Betrayed^56^All^Orgrimmar^Kaldorei Tome of Summoning^Ag'tor Bloodfist^Betrayed^^^Destroy the arcane focusing crystal tied to Magus Rimtori and then slay her. Afterwards, take the Head of Magus Rimtori to Ag'tor Bloodfist in Azshara.^A few more moments of thought brings a few ideas to mind, one of which brings a smile to your face: perhaps destroying the crystals would upset the blood elf responsible for the slaughter of so many orcs and the betrayal of Belgrom? You continue to decipher more of the script and pictures and realize that one of the crystals is tied to the creator of the circle--the others are tied to something far more sinister. You close the book and begin to decide which crystal to destroy.Betrayed^56^All^Orgrimmar^Ag'tor Bloodfist^Belgrom Rockmaul^Betrayed^^^Speak to Belgrom Rockmaul in Orgrimmar.^Return to Belgrom in Orgrimmar. He will want to see her head for himself! We'll return there shortly. Ah, this is indeed a good day. Thank you for your help, <name>.Breaking the Ward^58^All^Azshara^Loramus Thalipedes^Loramus Thalipedes^Kirith^^^Wait for Loramus to complete the enlightenment spell.^You are foolhardy, <name>. It is an admirable quality of your kind - to blindly enter battle when you have little to no chance of success. I will assist you, if only to see just one of Razelikh's minions fall. To break the ward placed over Razelikh's subordinates will take time and require the acquisition of rare artifacts. Be still, I must first perform the enlightenment ritual. The information I gather will assist me in forging weapons of great power.The Name of the Beast^58^All^Azshara^Loramus Thalipedes^Lord Arkkoroc^Kirith^^^Speak with Lord Arkkoroc in Azshara. Begin your search at the waters edge to find the Temple of Arkkoran.^There is only one way to harm the demon lord and his minions. A weapon of power must be forged bearing his true name. When such a weapon is forged, the demon and all under his command are vulnerable. A lesser deity resides in Azshara: Lord Arkkoroc. You must seek him out but be warned, his minions will stop at nothing to destroy you if you are discovered. Undoubtedly, you will have to pay a price for such information.The Name of the Beast^58^All^Azshara^Lord Arkkoroc^Lord Arkkoroc^Kirith^^^Slay Hetaera and bring back Hetaera's Bloodied Head, Hetaera's Beaten Head, and Hetaera's Bruised Head to Lord Arkkoroc.^She kills my children, mortal. She that calls herself the ruler of these oceans. A false god, nothing more. Crush her and bring back all of her heads. For that, you will be given the name that you seek and something else of equal importance. She roams the clutch... Hetaera she is called. <Lord Arkkoroc points to the southwest.> Go!The Name of the Beast^58^All^Azshara^Lord Arkkoroc^Loramus Thalipedes^Kirith^^^Take the temper back to Loramus Thalipedes.^As promised, I will reveal the name of the demon lord, Razelikh the Defiler. First, however, I must prepare something of utmost importance for your journey. The weapon you seek to create requires a temper. Give me a moment to drain the blood from these heads. <Lord Arkkoroc squeezes the heads in between his gigantic fists, draining them of their blood.> Take the temper back to Loramus along with the name of the beast: Rakh'likh.In Eranikus' Own Words^55^ ^Swamp of Sorrows^Itharius^Umbranse the Spiritspeaker^^The Essence of Eranikus^^Travel to the eastern part of Winterspring and speak with Umbranse the Spiritspeaker.^<name>, our first step will be to devise a method to speak with Eranikus through the gem. He lies in a precarious state between sleep and death now, twisted within a weave of nightmares. Though the essence you have given me is badly tainted, there is a chance we can reach him. Travel far to the icy lands of eastern Winterspring and seek one of our mortal allies, Umbranse the Spiritspeaker. He is a human medium who speaks for the dead. Though Eranikus is not truly dead, he may be of aid to us still.The Runed Scroll^25^Horde^The Barrens^Runed Scroll^Kadrak^The Runed Scroll^^^Take the Runed Scroll to the northern guard tower in the Barrens.^The official-looking scroll is wrapped tightly with a silvery ribbon. You're sure someone would be interested in seeing this, but who? There is an outpost close to the Ashenvale border to the north, and if the information on this scroll involves the night elves, this would be the place to take it.Horde Presence^29^Horde^The Barrens^Kadrak^Kadrak^The Runed Scroll^^^Kill the leader of the Talon Den, Rynthariel the Keymaster.^This scroll is from that scheming dryad Rynthariel, Keymaster of the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak. She'll not be making any more contact with the messenger you looted this from, heh, but we must stand our ground here. The Horde will not tolerate her outrunners here. <name>, travel to the Talon Den. Kill Rynthariel, and then put up a symbol for all to see. Take this Horde flag, <name>. Put it up in the Talon Den so that they will not be so rash as to send another messenger through our territory again.Stealing Knowledge^52^All^Azshara^Jediga^Jediga^^^Delivery to Magatha, Delivery to Jes'rimon, Delivery to Andron Gant, Delivery to Archmage Xylem^Find the Tablet of Beth'Amara, the Tablet of Jin'yael, the Tablet of Markri, and the Tablet of Sael'hai before returning to Jediga in Azshara.^I admit, <name>, I've made the most of my situation in Azshara. Belgrom's punishment has had its share of benefits. Before I left, I did some research and you would be surprised how many valuable items are lying around. I'll tell you more about my deals, and even give you a cut of the profits, if you help me gather some of them. There are tablets throughout the Ruins of Eldarath to the east that I need. All four are named after Highborne wizards. Get them for me and we'll talk some more.Delivery to Magatha^52^All^Azshara^Jediga^Magatha Grimtotem^Delivery to Magatha^Stealing Knowledge^^Bring the Tablet of Beth'Amara to Magatha in Thunder Bluff.^The first tablet goes to a tauren female... one called Magatha. She is among the elders in Thunder Bluff, and is one of the proponents of the alliance between the tauren and the Forsaken. She, more than anyone among the elders, feels the tauren and their ways can help the Forsaken find a path back to being human. Bring her the Tablet of Beth'Amara. The tablet may be the link she needs in finding a way to help the Forsaken... or so she claims.A Friend in Need^4^All^Teldrassil^Iverron^Dirania Silvershine^A Friend in Need^A Good Friend^^Speak to Dirania Silvershine in Shadowglen.^Ughhh... I was bitten very badly by a spider named Githyiss the Vile while exploring the spider cave very close to here. I am sure I have been seriously poisoned; you must help me. Please tell Dirania Silvershine. She will be able to help me. Hurry... I'm so dizzy...Screecher Spirits^44^All^Tanaris^Yeh'kinya^Yeh'kinya^Screecher Spirits^^^Capture the spirits of 3 screechers in Feralas, then return to Yeh'kinya in Steamwheedle Port.^I seek the spirits of the vale screechers of Feralas. They are the cousins of an old, old god, and their spirits are linked to him. Take this bramble wand and go to Feralas. Find and defeat vale screechers in southern and central Feralas, then wave my bramble over their fallen bodies. This will coax their spirit to reveal itself. Touch the spirit and collect its essence. Return to me with my bramble and with the collected essence, and I will tell you more of the old god of which I spoke.Iverron's Antidote^4^All^Teldrassil^Dirania Silvershine^Dirania Silvershine^A Friend in Need^^Iverron's Antidote^Collect 7 Hyacinth Mushrooms, 4 Moonpetal Lilies, and 1 Webwood Ichor for Dirania Silveshine in Shadowglen.^We may be able to help Iverron, as I know of an antidote that should help with the poison. It requires some ingredients, though, before I can make it. I'll need Hyacinth mushrooms. You can find these growing under trees, or you may collect them from the grell south of here; they seem to have taken a liking to them. I'll also need Moonpetal lilies, which only grow around watery pools. The last ingredient may prove the most difficult. From the very spiders that poisoned Iverron, collect Webwood ichor.Iverron's Antidote^4^All^Teldrassil^Dirania Silvershine^Iverron^^Iverron's Antidote^^Bring Iverron's Antidote to Iverron before the time limit is up. Iverron can be found by the cave to the north.^The antidote is ready, <name>. Please see that Iverron drinks it. There is something that you should know -- the antidote -- it will only remain viable for 5 minutes. You must get it to him in time. Speed be with you, <name>.Scourge of the Downs^37^All^Razorfen Downs^Belnistrasz^Belnistrasz^Scourge of the Downs^^^If you agree to aid Belnistrasz, speak with him again and hand the Oathstone he gave you back to him.^Outstanding! My name is Belnistrasz, and I thank you for rescuing me. I had given myself up for dead... or worse, as a meal for these Scourge-infested vermin. Yes - I said Scourge all right; they've brokered some sort of deal with the Quilboar here, and this nightmare is a result. Listen... rather than just flee, I want to make a difference for all of our sakes. Would you be up to helping me out to that end? It's probably dangerous, but you seem to be the type not to worry about that too much.Washed Ashore^13^All^Darkshore^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^Washed Ashore^^^Recover Sea Creature Bones from the beached sea creature just south of Auberdine, and then return with it to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^Majestic sea creatures are known to launch themselves at the Darkshore coastline, beached there until they die. Lately, these beasts have been washing ashore in ever-increasing numbers. I've been sent here by the Temple of the Moon to investigate, but the presence of murlocs along the water has made my research difficult. There is a giant creature washed ashore just south of Auberdine that is ringed by the foul Greymist murlocs. Could you go there and retrieve bones from the creature for our study?Extinguishing the Idol^37^All^Razorfen Downs^Belnistrasz^Belnistrasz's Brazier^Scourge of the Downs^^^Escort Belnistrasz to the Quilboar's idol in Razorfen Downs.^Near the entrance is an idol that functions as a macabre oven for the Quilboar; the beasts... they literally consume their abductees from the Barrens. I can shut down the idol and bind them from using it again, but I need your aid in doing so. My plan: escort me to the idol. Once we arrive, I'll commence the ritual. I'll barely be able to communicate with you, let alone defend myself. Protect me while I shut down the idol. If they take me down, then it's all over for us. Are you with me?!Goblin Engineering^10^Horde^Engineering^Graham Van Talen^Nixx Sprocketspring^^^The Pledge of Secrecy^If you wish to learn more about Goblin Engineering, take the Manual of Engineering Disciplines to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan.^Expert engineering yields two distinct disciplines: gnome and goblin. Clearly, goblin engineering is the choice of all brilliant engineers. Learn to master the world through the judicious use of high explosives and fantastic gear! <name>, read this manual. If you want to learn about goblin engineering, then take it to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan. Remember - membership is permanent and prevents joining the other discipline, so make sure this is what you want before finishing his task.The Prophecy of Mosh'aru^47^All^Tanaris^Yeh'kinya^Yeh'kinya^Screecher Spirits^^^Bring the First and Second Mosh'aru Tablets to Yeh'kinya in Tanaris.^The ancient prophecy of Mosh'aru speaks of a way to contain the god Hakkar's essence. It was written on two tablets and taken to the troll city of Zul'Farrak, west of Gadgetzan. Bring me the Mosh'aru tablets! The first tablet is held by the long-dead troll Theka the Martyr. It is said his persecutors were cursed into scarabs and now scuttle about his shrine. The second tablet is held by the hydromancer Velratha, near the sacred pool of Gahz'rilla. When you have the tablets, bring them to me.The God Hakkar^53^All^Tanaris^Yeh'kinya^Yeh'kinya^Screecher Spirits^^The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru^Bring the Filled Egg of Hakkar to Yeh'kinya in Tanaris.^Now it is time to capture the essence of the avatar of Hakkar. Take the Egg of Hakkar to the Sanctum of the Fallen God in the Sunken Temple in Azeroth. Invoke the egg's power to stir the dead god. He will send his minions against you. Defeat his bloodrinkers and take their Hakkari blood, then use the blood to dowse the eternal flames that hold Hakkar's spirit. When all the flames go out, the avatar of Hakkar will enter our world. Defeat him, and place his essence within the egg of Hakkar.Delivery to Jes'rimon^52^All^Azshara^Jediga^Jes'rimon^Delivery to Jes'rimon^Stealing Knowledge^^Bring the Tablet of Jin'yael to Jes'rimon in Orgrimmar.^I have a fence in Orgrimmar. He resides in The Drag. He's difficult to nail down if you don't know where to look, but if you go looking in one of the highest buildings there you should have no problem finding him. Do me a favor though, don't go shouting to all of Kalimdor that he's there and what his business is--it'd be bad for both of us. He'll give us more than a fair price for the Tablet of Jin'yael. I'm not sure why, but you should have seen how excited he was to hear about its whereabouts.Delivery to Andron Gant^52^All^Azshara^Jediga^Andron Gant^Delivery to Andron Gant^Stealing Knowledge^^Bring the Tablet of Markri to Andron Gant in Undercity.^Andron Gant is my next contact. He usually holds himself up in the Undercity... right near the Apothecarium. He was a little more loose-lipped when it came to speaking about what he wanted the Tablet for. Apparently some of the mages of Undercity are looking to study some of the arcane spells the highborne used. They think this tablet will help them. Markri was adept at summoning creatures; especially elementals.

Do you know what Kim'jael means to the Blood elves, <name>? Little rat... or something like that. The big bullies! They hired me to help them scout the area looking for some sort of lost treasures. Of course I jumped aboard the moment they said "treasure" and the amount they were willing to pay, but of course, they turned on me and tried to kill me... ME!

My felhounds will aid in the recovery of the crystal.The Formation of Felbane^58^All^Azshara^Loramus Thalipedes^Galvan the Ancient^The Formation of Felbane^Azsharite^^Take the Shipment to Galvan the Ancient in Stranglethorn Vale.^The weapons are ready to be forged.

The only way to the lair is through the use of the teleport runes near the mountain. As long as you hold the amulet, you can freely transport up to the lair. Once you reach the lair, you must conjure the beast. The amulet is your key, <name>. Use it on the Altar of the Defiler. Should you defeat the Defiler, bring back his horn.

Most intriguing. I wish the sprite darters could truly appreciate what it means to have those two look after them. They are both quite capable. So, they gave you the egg as a gift. Well, then you should be responsible for it for as long as you desire. It appears it's almost ready to hatch, but we should ensure it's healthy and no damage has been done to it. I only need two elixirs of fortitude for a small spell to protect the egg. I have the rest of the components here with me.The Newest Member of the Family^47^Alliance^Feralas^Quentin^Agnar Beastamer^The Newest Member of the Family^A Short Incubation^^Take your Fragile Sprite Darter Egg to the Hinterlands and speak to Agnar Beastamer, but hurry, you only have 1 hour to find him before the hatchling within the egg dies.^A magnificent specimen, <name>. If this creature survives gestation, then it'll be a healthy pet indeed! There is one last thing I would suggest doing if you plan on following through with this--head to Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands. Speak to a dwarf there named Agnar Beastamer, he's a master animal handler and should be able to guide you in the final steps of incubation. But hurry, <name>, this egg is fragile and will not last long without proper care.It's a Secret to Everybody^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^A Wrecked Raft^A Small Pack^It's a Secret to Everybody^^^Look around in the pond for a clue about who this wrecked raft may belong to.^A destroyed raft rests along the shoreline. Considering this is only a small pond, it is not clear as to how it ended up here, although looking at the trees tells you that the water level may not be constant. Perhaps a little exploration in the area might uncover more clues...It's a Secret to Everybody^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^A Small Pack^Linken^It's a Secret to Everybody^^^Examine the items inside the pack and bring them to their owner.^Grabbing onto it, you pull the pack back to the shore. Perhaps if you examine the items inside the pack, you might find out more about who it belongs to. There are a few stray travelers at Marshal's Refuge. Perhaps you might find out more there.Expedition Salvation^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^Williden Marshal^Williden Marshal^^^^Bring a Crate of Foodstuffs and Research Equipment to Williden Marshal in Un'Goro Crater.^I don't know how you made it here, but you're a sight for sore eyes! I'm Williden Marshal, and I lead a non-aligned expedition troupe. Our latest and greatest endeavor has met with what seems like countless disasters, the most serious of which being that we underestimated the savagery of Un'Goro Crater! As we fled our base camps in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the crater, we left behind vital supplies. You look like you're capable enough - can you help us by getting them back?Roll the Bones^51^All^Un'Goro Crater^Spark Nilminer^Spark Nilminer^^^^Bring 8 Dinosaur Bones to Spark Nilminer in Un'Goro Crater.^You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging. There might be worse things to do in this world... but none really leap to mind. We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons. Well, there are plenty of live ones there too! Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones. Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well.Alien Ecology^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^Hol'anyee Marshal^Hol'anyee Marshal^^^^Use the Scraping Vial to collect a Hive Wall Sample from one of the Gorishi hive hatcheries in Un'Goro Crater. Look for the chambers with the hanging larval spawns.^Just because we've suffered a setback doesn't mean that research must stop! We were investigating the Gorishi insects in the southern part of the crater before winding up here. Their presence is alien to the ecology of Un'Goro, and we want to find out why. In their hive network must be larval hatcheries. You can identify these places by their hanging larval spawns. Use this vial to take a sample of the hive wall near any of the hatcheries. Bring it back to me for study, but be careful!Williden's Journal^50^All^Un'Goro Crater^A Mangled Journal^Williden Marshal^^^^Return the journal to Williden Marshal somewhere in Un'Goro Crater.^You have uncovered a mangled journal. Parts of it remain legible, with a Williden Marshal claiming ownership over the contents therein. If the journal is accurate, then Williden may be found somewhere in the northern part of the Crater; according to the journal, he and his companions sought higher ground from the savage beasts of the Crater once their base camps were overrun.Rattling the Rattlecages^3^All^Tirisfal Glades^Shadow Priest Sarvis^Shadow Priest Sarvis^^The Mindless Ones^^Kill 8 Rattlecage Skeletons, and then return to Shadow Priest Sarvis in Deathknell when you are done.^You've shown your potential to the Forsaken under normal circumstances <name> - now let's see you under pressure. The Rattlecage skeletons, more mindless minions of the Lich King, are a tougher foe than the zombies you have faced thus far. Again, thin their numbers and prove yourself to the Forsaken. Do not tarry - when you are done, speak to me again.Scavenging Deathknell^3^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Deathguard Saltain^Deathguard Saltain^^The Damned^^Search Deathknell and the vicinity for 6 pieces of Scavenged Goods, and return them to Deathguard Saltain.^You there! If you're looking for something to make yourself useful, then listen up! We need fresh out-of-the-ground recruits to head into Deathknell and search for any sort of useful equipment. Most likely, they'll be in stacks of boxes. We expect more recruits to be rising soon, and unless we want them to stumble about naked we had better get to scavenging! Well get to work, you miserable bag of bones! I'm not going to reward those without some hustle.Milly Osworth^4^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Deputy Willem^Milly Osworth^Milly Osworth^Wolves Across the Border^^Speak with Milly Osworth.^You've shown yourself a dependable <class>, <name>. Dependable, and not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I have a friend, Milly Osworth, who's in some trouble. She's over with her wagon on the other side of the abbey, near the stable. I'm sure she could use a pair of hands like yours.Milly's Harvest^4^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Milly Osworth^Milly Osworth^Milly Osworth^^Grape Manifest^Bring 8 crates of Milly's Harvest to Milly Osworth at Northshire Abbey.^A gang of brigands, the Defias, moved into the Northshire Vineyards while I was harvesting! I reported it to the Northshire guards and they assured me they'd take care of things, but... I'm afraid for my crop of grapes! If the Defias don't steal them then I fear our guards will trample them when they chase away the thugs. Please, you must help me! I gathered most of my grapes into buckets, but I left them in the vineyards to the southeast. Bring me those buckets! Save my harvest!Grape Manifest^4^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Milly Osworth^Brother Neals^^Milly's Harvest^^Bring the Grape Manifest to Brother Neals in Northshire Abbey.^Now that my crop is saved, take this Grape Manifest to Brother Neals. He manages the store of food and drink in Northshire, and I'm sure he'll be delighted to hear that he has fresh grapes. You'll find Brother Neals in the abbey, in the bell tower... where he likes to taste his wine.Disharmony of Flame^52^Horde^Blackrock Mountain^Thunderheart^Thunderheart^Disharmony of Flame^^Commander Gor'shak, The Last Element^Travel to the quarry in Blackrock Mountain and slay Overmaster Pyron. Return to Thunderheart when you have completed this assignment.^The elders have felt a disturbance amongst the elements. The Dark Iron dwarves have summoned a foul spirit into our world that threatens to plague our lands with an eternal draught. This disharmony of flame must be investigated. Travel to Blackrock Mountain, through the Chasm of Flame, into the quarry. It is there that you shall find this lord of fire: Overmaster Pyron. End the disruption and return to me.Disharmony of Fire^56^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Thunderheart^Thunderheart^Disharmony of Flame^^^Enter Blackrock Depths and track down Lord Incendius. Slay him and return any source of information you may find to Thunderheart.^I can taste the foulness in the air that surrounds you, <name>. There is another, hidden in the depths of Blackrock, who does control this foulness. The wind and earth cry his name: Lord Incendius... but someone... something... commands this being. He is merely an emissary. Find him and discover where his master hides. Return to me when you have collected this information.It's a Secret to Everybody^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^Linken^Donova Snowden^It's a Secret to Everybody^^The Videre Elixir^Take Linken's Sword to Donova Snowden in Winterspring.^You see, I have no idea how I ended up here. No one really knows -- it's a secret to everybody! I just can't seem to remember anything... These items you brought to me, though... I am remembering something. My sword. I am supposed to strengthen it somehow, but I'm really not sure why. Sorry I can't tell you more, but I just don't remember! Anyhoo, I do know where you can take it -- Donova Snowden in Winterspring. You'll find her by the hot springs. She can temper the sword by the pools there.The Videre Elixir^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^Donova Snowden^Donova Snowden^The Videre Elixir^It's a Secret to Everybody^^Seek out Gregan Brewspewer in northern Feralas. From him, learn how you may acquire the Videre Elixir, then return to Donova Snowden in Winterspring.^Now, what's this? Linken... FORGOT? Oh, I see... Lost his memory... Well, here is his sword. It's not complete, though. I know of the one that can finish it, but... speaking with him may prove difficult. Listen, I know of someone that will be able to help you. It's too much to explain right now, but you must somehow acquire a Videre Elixir. The only one I know that can help you with that is Gregan Brewspewer. He's hard to track down, but last I knew he was camping in the wilds of Feralas.Meet at the Grave^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^Donova Snowden^Gaeriyan^The Videre Elixir^^^Go to the graveyard outside Gadgetzan, and use the Videre Elixir. Follow the rest of Donova's instructions to find Gaeriyan.^This elixir will allow you to speak with one that you would not normally even see... Take the Videre elixir, along with Linken's sword, to the graveyard just outside Gadgetzan in Tanaris. Once there, drink the potion. You may be quite surprised at the results, but do not be alarmed. In your "other" form, head due north until you reach the mountains. You'll find the one you need to speak with in one of the rocky crevices. His name is Gaeriyan. Remember, he will only speak to you in that form...A Grave Situation^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^Gaeriyan^A Conspicuous Gravestone^The Videre Elixir^^^Resurrect, then look for the gravestone that Gaeriyan told you to find.^If you return to the graveyard, <name>, you will find a gravestone there... Not just any gravestone; this one will stand out from the others. Secrets lie within it. Push on the stone, and you will learn of these secrets...Linken's Sword^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^A Conspicuous Gravestone^Linken^The Videre Elixir^^^Deliver Linken's Superior Sword to Linken in Un'Goro Crater.^After a strong flash of light, you are able to pick up the sword again. It has been transformed!Wenikee Boltbucket^14^Horde^The Barrens^Sputtervalve^Wenikee Boltbucket^Wenikee Boltbucket^Samophlange^^Bring the Broken Samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket.^I think I might have broken that Samophlange. That's not good, because I already told some colleagues in Undermine about it and they were very intrigued. We must find a way to fix it! Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, the horde outpost between the Barrens and Ashenvale. She is very clever and inquisitive. If you show her the samophlange I bet she'd jump at the chance to fix it.Nugget Slugs^15^Horde^The Barrens^Wenikee Boltbucket^Wenikee Boltbucket^Wenikee Boltbucket^^Rilli Greasygob^Bring 15 Nugget Slugs to Wenikee Boltbucket in the Barrens.^I want to fix this samophlange, but to do that I'm going to need some supplies. I ran out of seventeen-point-five gauge nugget slugs and I'm going to need a bunch of those for the work ahead. The closest place to get them is the Sludge Fen to the east. The Venture Company usually keeps them in their tool buckets. Go to the Sludge Fen and look in the tool buckets you find there, then return to me when you've gathered enough nugget slugs.Rilli Greasygob^18^Horde^The Barrens^Wenikee Boltbucket^Rilli Greasygob^Rilli Greasygob^Nugget Slugs^^Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to Rilli Greasygob in Orgrimmar.^Well, that didn't work. I put some extra gauges on the samophlange to measure its structural integrity, and they read the integrity at an all-time low. I could add some more dials and maybe a lever or two to try and fix it, but... I think that might make things even worse. You should take the samophlange to Rilli Greasygob. He used to work for the Venture Company -- if anyone knows how to fix it, it's Rilli. You can find him at Nogg's Machine Shop in Orgrimmar, in the Valley of Honor.Samophlange Manual^19^Horde^The Barrens^Rilli Greasygob^Rilli Greasygob^Rilli Greasygob^^^Bring the Samophlange Manual to Rilli Greasygob in Orgrimmar.^I think I can fix the samophlange, but I'm going to need the user's manual first. When I was in the Venture Company I had a rival, Boss Copperplug, who hoarded the secrets of the samophlange, giving out small bits of knowledge on the device to those he trusted. I wasn't one of the trusted few... Boss Copperplug used to stay at the Boulder Lode Mine in northeastern Barrens. Get the manual from him, and if he's given pages from it to anyone, you'll have to collect them too.A Gnome's Assistance^52^All^Un'Goro Crater^Linken^J.D. Collie^The Videre Elixir^^Linken's Memory^Find J.D. Collie in the cave at Marshal's Refuge.^Thinking... Thinking... I know I came here for something important... I have an idea, <name>. In the cave over there is a gnome named J.D. that was very kind to me when I first arrived here. Perhaps in my disoriented state, I might have mentioned something to her. Why don't you go ask her if she knows anything? Oh, but be careful -- she's always messing with those crazy glowing crystals I've seen in the crater. I'm not quite sure what she's up to in there!Linken's Memory^54^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^Eridan Bluewind^Linken's Memory^A Gnome's Assistance^^Find Eridan Bluewind in southern Felwood.^Oh... Linken? Yeah, he's a funny one. When he first got here, he was mumbling about all kinds of strange things. Probably got bumped on the head pretty hard, I imagine. Something he said kinda stuck with me though -- that he was making some sort of totem; said he had to talk to someone named Eridan Bluewind... in a place called Felwood, I think? I doubt he could tell you much now, though. If you want to know more, maybe you should look for Eridan yourself?Linken's Adventure^54^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^Linken^Linken's Adventure^Aquementas^^Take the Silver Totem of Aquementas to Linken in Marshal's Refuge.^To think all this time that the reason Linken came here was to rid us of Blazerunner... He seems like such an ordinary guy, but I did notice that he's not at all interested in any of my experiments or gadgets like most gnomes would be. He must be a true warrior at heart. Bring the totem to him. See if that helps him remember why he came here.It's Dangerous to Go Alone^56^All^Un'Goro Crater^Linken^Linken^Linken's Adventure^^^Travel to Fire Plume Ridge, south of Marshal's Refuge.^<name>, I finally remember now... I did come here to fight Blazerunner. I was on a journey, and this was to be the last step. But I am no longer the hero... You are. All that you have done -- you must finish this now, not me. Blazerunner guards an artifact called the Golden Flame. It provides power more vast than anything else I have ever known, and it is dangerous in the hands of one with an evil heart. You will want to bring others with you -- it's dangerous to go alone. Take this as my advice.Commander Gor'shak^52^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Galamav the Marksman^Commander Gor'shak^Commander Gor'shak^Disharmony of Flame^^Find Commander Gor'shak in Blackrock Depths.^Poor Gargal... didn't even see it coming. WHAM! The arrow landed dead center on the top of his head. He was no genius before but now... <Galamav grimaces.> When we dislodged the arrow, we noticed a rolled up note attached to the shaft. On the note was a crudely drawn picture of an orc behind bars with the signature of Commander Gor'shak attached. If he's still alive in the Depths, you'll have to find him. A trap you say? Well no kidding, numb hooves! That's why you're going!What Is Going On?^54^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Commander Gor'shak^Commander Gor'shak^Commander Gor'shak^^^Defend Gor'shak.^I was sent here under the auspices of Thrall. Do you actually think these buffoons could capture me? I allowed myself to be captured so that I could gather intelligence. <Gor'shak whispers.> The Princess of Ironforge has been kidnapped by Emperor Thaurissan. Princess Bronzebeard is in this very city! I bet old Magni's heart almost stopped when he heard that news. <Gor'shak laughs.> Shhh! Do you hear that? Guards coming! DEFEND YOURSELF!What Is Going On?^54^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Commander Gor'shak^Thrall^Commander Gor'shak^^^Speak with Kharan Mighthammer and gather information about Princess Moira Bronzebeard's kidnapping. Take that information to Thrall in Orgrimmar.^So far, my communication with the dwarf, Kharan, in the cell across the hall, has been limited. I have, however, managed to convince him that I, rather -we- mean him no harm. Go speak with him and gather as much information about the Princess and her captors as possible. Take that information back to the Warchief. Thrall does not want the Princess harmed, but instead, has some grand plan laid out, which includes her being safely returned to Ironforge. Kharan already knows all of this... Go!The Eastern Kingdoms^54^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Thrall^Thrall^Commander Gor'shak^^^Speak with Thrall if you are prepared to take on the mission he has planned.^You bring excellent information, <name>. As Warchief, it is my duty to do what is best for the Horde. To ensure that the generations that come after us are not forced into a hopeless existence. The opportunity to shape our future alliances has fallen into our collective laps. A move to help the dwarves could greatly strengthen our relationships in the Eastern Kingdoms. This, then, is why you must not fail! Are you prepared?The Royal Rescue^59^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Thrall^Princess Moira Bronzebeard^Commander Gor'shak^^^Slay Emperor Dagran Thaurissan and free Princess Moira Bronzebeard from his evil spell.^This strike against the Dark Iron dwarves, if successful, will send a shockwave throughout their entire kingdom. Princess Bronzebeard is under the control of Emperor Thaurissan. To free her, you must kill the Emperor. Be warned, your task is doubly dangerous, as Bronzebeard will attack you without question while under the control of the Emperor. DO NOT HARM HER!The Princess Saved?^60^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Princess Moira Bronzebeard^Thrall^Commander Gor'shak^^^Return to Thrall at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.^You have slain my husband, <race>! My child will be born into this world without a father. <Princess Moira points directly at you.> I assure you, this child will be the next ruler of the kingdom of Ironforge. You and your kind shall be hunted down until the end of days for this wrongful act. <You think that Princess Moira may be suffering from the residual effect of Thaurissan's spell.> Leave me be, <race>. I am certain your warchief will be eager to hear the results of his meddling.Aquementas^54^All^Un'Goro Crater^Eridan Bluewind^J.D. Collie^Linken's Memory^^Linken's Adventure^Take the Book of Aquor, the Silvery Claws, and the Irontree Heart to Tanaris.^Take this bag of supplies with you to Tanaris. Travel to Lost Rigger Cove, and look for a circle of stones. The eastmost peninsula is the secret... From this circle only, read from the book of Aquor; summon the only creature that can transform the items you collected into a totem to fight Blazerunner. Aquementas will not be pleased to be awakened, but remember, you must remain in the circle for him to transform the items.Counterattack!^20^Horde^The Barrens^Regthar Deathgate^Regthar Deathgate^^Hezrul Bloodmark^^Bring a Piece of Krom'zar's Banner to Regthar Deathgate, west of the Crossroads.^The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened. I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance. My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west! Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens. Kill them until their leader, Warlord Krom'zar, appears. Defeat him and bring me a piece of his banner as proof. We're counting on you, <name>.A Taste of Flame^54^All^Burning Steppes^Cyrus Therepentous^Cyrus Therepentous^A Taste of Flame^Trinkets...^A Taste of Flame^Show Cyrus Therepentous the Black Dragonflight Molt you received from Kalaran Windblade.^The flight is aware of your work in the Searing Gorge. Show it to me, <race>. The molt, imbecile.A Taste of Flame^54^All^Burning Steppes^Cyrus Therepentous^Cyrus Therepentous^A Taste of Flame^^A Taste of Flame^Show Cyrus Therepentous proof of your worth.^You seek out the Flight? Present to me proof of your worth, mortal.A Taste of Flame^58^All^Blackrock Depths^Cyrus Therepentous^Cyrus Therepentous^A Taste of Flame^^^Travel to Blackrock Depths and slay Bael'Gar.^I wish to taste the searing flames of the mountain of fire. To let the molten fires of Blackrock cascade across my being. That essence, that searing heat, it is what I crave. Bael'Gar resides in the Depths of Blackrock: A being of pure flame, born of the fires of Ragnaros. Slay Bael'Gar and from his smoldering remains bring for me a piece of his inner fire. Use the molt on his remains to safely extract the inner flame. Succeed and be rewarded.The Rise of the Machines^54^Horde^Burning Steppes^Hierophant Theodora Mulvadania^Hierophant Theodora Mulvadania^The Rise of the Machines^^^Venture to the Burning Steppes and recover 10 Fractured Elemental Shards for Hierophant Theodora Mulvadania.^The machines made themselves known to us during our initial forays into the Searing Gorge. Upon further investigation we discovered that they were being imported from Burning Steppes, possibly Blackrock Depths. That is what we need you for, <name>. Your first task is to venture to the Burning Steppes and recover elemental shards from the rock automatons and lesser rock creations of the region. Once you have collected a sufficient amount, return to me and I shall determine their source of origin.The Rise of the Machines^54^Horde^Badlands^Hierophant Theodora Mulvadania^Lotwil Veriatus^The Rise of the Machines^^^Take the Elemental Shard Sample to Lotwil Veriatus.^G.L.A. Those are the 'initials' imprinted on the elemental shards. Below the initials are a rank marking of some sort. The machinations you destroyed in the Burning Steppes were of 'Rank IV.' I assume that this is a lowly rank. Take this shard sample to Lotwil Veriatus in the camp to the east. He is a scholar of some renown in the field of elemental sciences. He may be able to assist us in our search.The Rise of the Machines^58^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Lotwil Veriatus^Lotwil Veriatus^The Rise of the Machines^^^Find and slay Golem Lord Argelmach. Return his head to Lotwil. You will also need to collect 10 Intact Elemental Cores from the Ragereaver Golems and Warbringer Constructs protecting Argelmach. You know this because you are psychic.^This can't be Argelmach! Argelmach was killed ten years ago. How can I be sure? I was the one who killed him. He was a despicable dwarf, hell-bent on twisting my life's work to meet his diabolical needs. It seems that the wicked always find a way to escape justice. If this is Argelmach's handiwork then he must be destroyed. I will need samplings of his latest creations. With the proper samples, I may be able to stop this uprising. The creations guard Argelmach in Blackrock Depths.KILL ON SIGHT: Dark Iron Dwarves^52^Horde^Blackrock Depths^WANTED^Warlord Goretooth^^^KILL ON SIGHT: High Ranking Dark Iron Of^Venture to Blackrock Depths and destroy the vile aggressors!^By order of Warlord Goretooth, commander of the Kargath Expeditionary Force: Any and all of General Angerforge's forces within Blackrock Depths must be annihilated. Angerforge's men are ruthless killers, responsible for the mass murder of the 109th division of the Kargath Expeditionary Force. Heroes are warned to exercise extreme caution when confronting these brutes. Any person who destroys the first line of General Angerforge's forces in Blackrock Depths shall receive a tribute.KILL ON SIGHT: High Ranking Dark Iron Officials^54^Horde^Blackrock Depths^KILL ON SIGHT^Warlord Goretooth^^KILL ON SIGHT: Dark Iron Dwarves^Grark Lorkrub^Venture to Blackrock Depths and destroy the vile aggressors!^By order of Warlord Goretooth, commander of the Kargath Expeditionary Force: Head of the K.E.F. reconnaissance division, Grandmaster Lexlort, has returned with news of the whereabouts of high ranking Dark Iron officials. Through locked gate, near the heart of the city, they train their forces to snuff out our men.

But worry not; if your friend was on a journey to find me, I do know what it was he desired. In the heart of Un'Goro Crater dwells evil of the purest form. This evil takes the shape of an elemental called Blazerunner... protected by an aura that none can dispel... None... except those with enough power to do so. I can teach you of this power, <name>. First, do as I ask. Collect 11 Silvery Claws and 1 Irontree Heart from the creatures in Felwood, then return.Cleansing Felwood^55^Alliance^Felwood^Arathandris Silversky^Arathandris Silversky^^^Salve via Hunting, Salve via Mining, Salve via Gathering, Salve via Skinning, Salve via Disenchanting^Bring 15 Blood Amber to Arathandris Silversky in Felwood.^Plants give life to Felwood, yet even they suffer the taint of corruption. I know ways to cleanse them, but I cannot give out such knowledge to those I don't know or trust. Prove to me that you will truly aid the cause of the Cenarion Circle! To the north lie the Irontree Caverns. The Warpwood elementals present there are now beyond hope of cleansing. I ask you to bring me their sap - blood amber it is called - so I may study it in the hopes of saving other forms of life here.Cleansing Felwood^55^Horde^Felwood^Maybess Riverbreeze^Maybess Riverbreeze^^^Salve via Hunting, Salve via Mining, Salve via Gathering, Salve via Skinning, Salve via Disenchanting^Bring 15 Blood Amber to Maybess Riverbreeze in Felwood.^Plants give life to Felwood, yet even they suffer the taint of corruption. I know ways to cleanse them, but I cannot give out such knowledge to those I don't know or trust. Prove to me that you will truly aid the cause of the Cenarion Circle! To the north lie the Irontree Caverns. The Warpwood elementals present there are now beyond hope of cleansing. I ask you to bring me their sap - blood amber it is called - so I may study it in the hopes of saving other forms of life here.The Strength of Corruption^52^Horde^Feralas^Talo Thornhoof^Talo Thornhoof^^^^Talo Thornhoof at Camp Mojache in Feralas wants you to kill 12 Angerclaw Grizzlies and 12 Felpaw Ravagers in Felwood.^Being a hunter, I strive to emulate the strengths I see in my opponents. It is possible to turn the battle in your favor by simply knowing your enemy well, <name>. In a place called Felwood, north of Ashenvale, the creatures have been tainted by a substance called fel. The bears and wolves have been driven mad by it, but I believe that they have also grown even stronger as well. Go, <name>. Travel to Felwood and face these beasts. Learn for yourself if they are truly as strong as I believe.Precarious Predicament^58^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Grark Lorkrub^Lexlort^^Grark Lorkrub^Operation: Death to Angerforge^Escort your prisoner, Grark Lorkrub, through Burning Steppes and through Blackrock Mountain to the Searing Gorge.^Do you truly believe that you will make it to your rendezvous point with me in custody? You actually expected to break into a heavily fortified Blackrock fortress to capture a prized asset of theirs without alerting anyone or anything to your presence? You will be destroyed!Grark Lorkrub^58^All^Blackrock Depths^Lexlort^Grark Lorkrub^^KILL ON SIGHT: High Ranking Dark Iron Of^Precarious Predicament^Travel to the Burning Steppes and find Grark Lorkrub. You recall Lexlort mentioning that he was last seen in a massive Blackrock fortress.^I tracked him across the Searing Gorge, through the mountain, and into the Burning Steppes. That traitor was caught red-handed giving the Blackrock orcs vital information about our day to day operations. I'm speaking of Grark Lorkrub. He now sits in the Burning Steppes, safely under their protection - or so he thinks. Take these shackles, <name>. Find Grark, place the shackles on him and lead him through Blackrock Mountain. Do this and a tribute is yours.The Heart of the Mountain^55^All^Blackrock Depths^Maxwort Uberglint^Maxwort Uberglint^^^^Bring the Heart of the Mountain to Maxwort Uberglint in the Burning Steppes.^For years I have sought a certain gem. It is called the Heart of the Mountain and it's the size of your fist! The Dark Iron dwarves have it locked in their vault and, try as I may, they won't let me purchase it. So I must resort to force. Fight your way to the Lower Vault of Blackrock Depths, breach its secret safe and gain the Heart. To do that, you must defeat Watchman Doomgrip, and he won't appear until you've opened every relic coffer in the vault! Good luck.The Missing Courier^43^Alliance^Feralas^Latronicus Moonspear^Ginro Hearthkindle^The Missing Courier^^^Speak with Ginro Hearthkindle in Feathermoon Stronghold.^An associate of mine, Ginro Hearthkindle, is looking for assistance concerning the location of a courier and the parcels he was carrying. It has been a week or so since the courier went missing; our own searches have proved fruitless, and we're at an impasse. Unfortunately, I have had to declare the courier as missing in action. If you have the time and resources to spare, please speak with Ginro. He should be here in the Stronghold - perhaps in his quarters.The Missing Courier^43^Alliance^Feralas^Ginro Hearthkindle^Wrecked Row Boat^The Missing Courier^^^Locate the courier's boat somewhere along the coast of Feralas.^It's been about a week since Raschal, the courier, set out for Thalanaar. He knows Feralas well; he's been with us since General Feathermoon led the expeditionary forces here. I know his plan was to take a row boat down the coast and try and traverse across southern Feralas to avoid the Horde camp. I couldn't find his boat, but maybe you can. Maybe it is hidden, or maybe it was sunk. Regardless, it might hold a clue as to where he is. If you uncover something, please let me know.Hurley Blackbreath^55^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Ragnar Thunderbrew^Ragnar Thunderbrew^Ragnar Thunderbrew^^^Bring the Lost Thunderbrew Recipe to Ragnar Thunderbrew in Kharanos.^The Dark Iron dwarves, led by the villain Hurley Blackbreath, stole one of the Thunderbrew's best recipes, Thunderbrew Lager. The villains! They don't deserve such a fine brew! <name>, I have a tough task for you. Go to the Blackrock Depths in the Burning Steppes, destroy any kegs of Thunderbrew Lager you find, and bring back our recipe for Thunderbrew Lager! Please, get that recipe back, even if you have to turn Blackrock Depths upside down to do it!Boat Wreckage^44^Alliance^Feralas^Wrecked Row Boat^Ginro Hearthkindle^The Missing Courier^^^Return to Feathermoon Stronghold and show Ginro Hearthkindle the Discarded Knife you have found.^Running your hand along the mud, your fingers graze the handle of a knife. It looks well cared for, and it might be safe to assume that whoever was on the boat might have lost it. Perhaps the large chunk of the missing boat might have something to do with the loss. You grab the knife, remembering that Ginro Hearthkindle in the Feathermoon Stronghold instructed you to return to him with any found clues. You get the feeling, however, that you are not quite alone in the water...Ragnar Thunderbrew^55^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Enohar Thunderbrew^Ragnar Thunderbrew^Ragnar Thunderbrew^^^Speak with Ragnar Thunderbrew.^Ho, <name>. I heard that Ragnar Thunderbrew is steaming mad about someone stealing his ale. He's looking for stalwart adventurers, and willing to pay plenty. Talk to Ragnar if you're interested. He's at the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos, in Dun Morogh.The Knife Revealed^44^Alliance^Feralas^Ginro Hearthkindle^Quintis Jonespyre^The Missing Courier^^Psychometric Reading^Take the Discarded Knife to Quintis Jonespyre in Feathermoon Stronghold.^The Stronghold's resident druid, Quintis Jonespyre, has some... unusual skills. One of them involves psychometry - the ability to reveal an item's history by touch. Don't ask me how he does it; I chalk it up to magic I do not and choose not to understand. I do know, however, two things: one, I've seen it work and two, the bum owes me. Take the knife up to Quint in his little tree-house here, and tell him for me that his Kalimdor Hold 'Em debt will be paid if he works his mojo on that knife.Psychometric Reading^44^Alliance^Feralas^Quintis Jonespyre^Ginro Hearthkindle^Psychometric Reading^The Knife Revealed^^Speak with Ginro Hearthkindle in Feathermoon Stronghold.^I'm a little wobbly still, sorry. Anyway, I received some useful visions. Raschal takes two large leather backpacks from his boat and goes inland; he returns to the boat, however. I see gnoll scalps... he ran into some gnolls - Woodpaw I think they're called. He's very worried - almost terrified - about something. So much so, that he is not paying attention to water elementals forming behind him. The images... stop there. I need to rest, sorry <name>. Tell Gin what I've seen. He needs to know.The Woodpaw Gnolls^44^Alliance^Feralas^Ginro Hearthkindle^Large Leather Backpacks^Psychometric Reading^^^Search the Woodpaw Gnoll camps of southern Feralas for evidence of the courier's belongings or the courier himself.^Our "friends" the Woodpaw might have gotten Raschal in the end, but something tells me that's not what occurred. Still, they're the best place to start looking. I wish I had clearer insight as to what to do, but all I have right now is 'Search the Woodpaw camps - go.' I do know that gnolls will keep items they scavenge and fight over them; maybe they ran across the backpacks Quint mentioned. I hadn't risked a head-on fight in past searches, but with Quint's vision on this I say rip into them.Operation: Death to Angerforge^58^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Warlord Goretooth^Warlord Goretooth^^Precarious Predicament^^Travel to Blackrock Depths and slay General Angerforge! Return to Warlord Goretooth when the task is complete.^You have done an exemplary job, <name>. It is now time to send you on your last mission. General Angerforge, the Dark Iron responsible for coordinating the attacks on the 109th division of the K.E.F. and the mass slaughter of our forces must be brought to justice. This will undoubtedly be your most grueling mission, but should you succeed, you will be richly rewarded.Vivian Lagrave^55^All^Blackrock Depths^Apothecary Zinge^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Vivian Lagrave^^^Speak with Shadowmaster Vivian Lagrave in Kargath.^Shadowmaster Vivian Lagrave is in need of your services. She is in the Badlands, in the orcish outpost of Kargath, pursuing rumors of a certain brew made by the Dark Iron dwarves of Blackrock Depths. Speak with Vivian. She awaits you.Lost Thunderbrew Recipe^55^All^Blackrock Depths^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Vivian Lagrave^^^Bring the Lost Thunderbrew Recipe to Vivian Lagrave in Kargath.^It is rumored that the Dark Iron Hurley Blackbreath has stolen a recipe for ale. This ale, Thunderbrew Lager, is said to infuse its imbiber with great strength and courage. We wish to study the drink. Perhaps, we will find other applications for its virtues... applications more in line with Forsaken objectives. Delve into Blackrock Depths, find Hurley, take from him the recipe for Thunderbrew lager and bring it to me. And to find him, you may have to entice him by threatening his precious ale.The Writhing Deep^46^Alliance^Feralas^Large Leather Backpacks^Zukk'ash Pod^Psychometric Reading^^^Now that Raschal's last known whereabouts have been discovered, continue your search for him or his remains in the Writhing Deep. According to the note, it is located to the south of the Woodpaw gnoll camps.^Inside the backpacks are two items: the first is a parcel of goods that was bound for Thalanaar, and the second is a note hastily penned to an unknown reader. The note tells of discovering insidious bug-like creatures south of the gnoll camps in a place called the Writhing Deep. The author felt the need to investigate it personally, as though it was a serious threat to all of Feralas. The note is signed, "Raschal of Feathermoon". It would seem that you have located where Raschal ultimately went.Ribbly Screwspigot^53^All^Blackrock Depths^Yuka Screwspigot^Yuka Screwspigot^Yuka Screwspigot^^^Bring Ribbly's Head to Yuka Screwspigot in the Burning Steppes.^My brother Ribbly has always been a drain to his family, taking our money and wasting it on one scheme after another. Well, his last scheme must have been his worst, because Baron Revilgaz of Booty Bay just put a price on poor Ribbly's head. I can't tell you how happy this makes the Screwspigots! Our little Ribbly's finally worth something! But now he's hiding out, deep in Blackrock Depths. Please, find him and bring him to me! Or, if he won't come, then that's ok... just bring me his head.Muigin and Larion^52^Alliance^Un'Goro Crater^Muigin^Muigin^Muigin and Larion^^^Collect 15 Bloodpetals and return to Muigin.^See Larion over there? It's HIS fault we're here! I told him we were going the wrong way, but would he listen? And would you believe that he's the one that won't speak to me? Well, until he changes his mind, let's have a bit of fun with him. Have you noticed the strange plant-like creatures around here? They're nothing but trouble, really, but I think if trained properly, I could get them to obey commands. First thing though, I'll need some samples to study. Do you think you could collect some?A Visit to Gregan^52^Alliance^Un'Goro Crater^Muigin^Gregan Brewspewer^Muigin and Larion^^^Take a Bloodpetal to Gregan Brewspewer in Feralas.^I'm not quite sure what to make of this, <name>. The plants... they seem to have some minimal intelligence. I'm no expert, though. But, I do know someone that is! Head to northern Feralas, and look for a buddy of mine named Gregan Brewspewer. He's an expert on this sort of thing. I'm sure Gregan can help us out here. You'll find him out in the wilderness; he's not the type to live in a big city.Haze of Evil^52^Alliance^Un'Goro Crater^Gregan Brewspewer^Muigin^Muigin and Larion^^Bloodpetal Sprouts^Collect 5 samples of Atal'ai Haze, then return to Muigin in Un'Goro Crater.^To tell you the truth, <name>, I've never seen any plants like this in my travels. Perhaps I should take a trip to this crater... At any rate, I think I know just the thing Muigin's looking for -- Atal'ai haze. It's horrid stuff, hard to collect, but it's just what he needs to control the little monsters. You'll need to visit the temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows. The Atal'ai Haze can be collected from the deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes found there. Good luck, <name>!Larion and Muigin^52^Horde^Un'Goro Crater^Larion^Larion^Larion and Muigin^^^Hunt 5 Bloodpetal Lashers, 5 Bloodpetal Threshers, 5 Bloodpetal Flayers and 5 Bloodpetal Trappers for Larion at Marshal's Refuge.^See Muigin over there? It's HIS fault we're lost! I'm the one that knew the way, but he insisted he knew a shortcut, and we ended up here! To make matters worse, now he keeps sending his crazy plant pests to annoy me. I'm so angry that I'm not planning on talking to him any time soon, but these pests are too much to handle. Why don't we try to limit his supply, first thing. Go out and hunt some Bloodpetals, then return to me.Zapper Fuel^52^Horde^Un'Goro Crater^Liv Rizzlefix^Larion^Larion and Muigin^^Bloodpetal Zapper^Deliver the Unloaded Zapper and 5 samples of Atal'ai Haze to Larion in Marshal's Refuge.^You're in luck, <name>! I've been working on some of my own experiments while Marvon's been gone, and one of them is a short range bug zapper. With just a few adjustments, it should be great for ridding yourself of those Bloodpetal pests. I can let you have one of my zapper prototypes, but you'll still need to collect the fuel. You can get the necessary Atal'ai haze that the zapper needs in the temple of Atal'Hakkar. The deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes are the ones you'll need to get it from.Marvon's Workshop^52^Horde^Un'Goro Crater^Larion^Liv Rizzlefix^Larion and Muigin^^^Travel to Marvon Rivetseeker's workshop in Ratchet.^I managed to spy on what Muigin was doing, and he's actually growing the darn things over there! I think the only solution here is to... no, not go talk to him... What are you thinking? The solution is to fight back! We'll need the help of my friend, Marvon, who has a workshop in Ratchet. I'm sure he'll be able to create some sort of gadget that will help us.Recipe of the Kaldorei^7^All^Cooking^Zarrin^Zarrin^^^^Collect 7 Small Spider Legs for Zarrin in Dolanaar.^Long ago, the night elves were called the kaldorei, a name that means "children of the stars." Learning of the past is an important step in your path as a <class>, <name>, so listen well to what I have to tell you. The kaldorei have always taken much pride in their harmonious relationship with nature. This means that we only take from nature what is necessary, and that we return in kind. This balance has afforded us much, <name>. Go out and collect seven small spider legs -- no more than that, and return to me.Goblin Engineering^10^Alliance^Engineering^Lilliam Sparkspindle^Nixx Sprocketspring^^^The Pledge of Secrecy^If you wish to learn more about Goblin Engineering, take the Manual of Engineering Disciplines to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan.^Expert engineering yields two distinct disciplines: gnome and goblin. I only bother to mention goblin engineering because I'm a fair trainer. They like to make things that blow up, and they rarely care what is in the way - even themselves. <name>, read this manual. If you want to learn how to blow yourself up, then take it to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan. Remember - membership is permanent and prevents joining the other discipline, so make sure this is what you want before finishing his task.The Love Potion^54^All^Blackrock Depths^Mistress Nagmara^Mistress Nagmara^^^^Bring 4 Gromsblood, 10 Giant Silver Veins and Nagmara's Filled Vial to Mistress Nagmara in Blackrock Depths.^Oh, the pains of love! My dear Private Rocknot is immune to my charms. I am spurned! It's maddening! You must help me! We succubi know much of love, and I can make a potion to beat down the iron walls around Rocknot's heart. To make it, I need these items: the herb gromsblood, giant silver veins from the cliff giants of Azshara, and water from the Golakka Springs Crater in Un'Goro. You can place the water in this vial. Please, <name>, help a poor soul in her quest for happiness!Chasing A-Me 01^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^Karna Remtravel^A-Me 01^Chasing A-Me 01^^^Find A-Me 01 in Un'Goro Crater.^Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions. You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes? Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01. She has scrying gems for eyes so I could see everything she saw. She made it to Fungal Rock--the apes' lair--just east of here, and that's when I lost contact. The last thing I saw was one of their alpha males rushing up to say hello to her! Can you help me find her?Chasing A-Me 01^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^A-Me 01^A-Me 01^Chasing A-Me 01^^Chasing A-Me 01^Find a Mithril Casing and return to A-Me 01 in Un'Goro Crater.^A little further investigation shows a panel that slides open. Clearly written above some wiring is the statement, "Replace Mithril Casing And Turn Power Off Then On." Taking a moment to replace the panel, you wonder if it'll be that simple to fix A-Me 01 and get her back to Karna Remtravel near Marshall's Refuge. Only trying it will tell.Chasing A-Me 01^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^A-Me 01^Karna Remtravel^^Chasing A-Me 01^^Escort A-Me 01 back to Karna Remtravel in Un'Goro Crater.^Checking to see if you're prepared to lead A-Me 01 back to Karna Remtravel, you flip the switch to the "Off" position. Glancing around once again to make sure none of the gorillas are coming, you prepare to see what happens when you flip the switch back to the "On" position. This is your last chance... are you sure this is what you want to do?Ancient Spirit^56^Alliance^Felwood^Arei^Kayneth Stillwind^^Purified!^^Escort Arei to safety, then speak with Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song, in eastern Ashenvale.^Felwood was once a peaceful and serene land... Until the legion took hold. The infernals, destruction, chaos... The skull of Gul'dan ensured that none were spared here. All fell to the corruption. Even now, as a spirit, I still find myself trapped, bearing the suffering of this land. Help me find my way home. Please, <name>, tell me you will lead an ancient spirit away from here, where I may finally rest. Once I am free, seek out Kayneth Stillwind, a druid that resides in Forest Song, to the east.Overmaster Pyron^52^Alliance^Blackrock Mountain^Jalinda Sprig^Jalinda Sprig^Overmaster Pyron^^^Slay Overmaster Pyron.^The last five of my mages that went snooping around in Blackrock Mountain came back extra crispy with a permanent orange gnomefro - or worse. <Jalinda picks up some ashes from the ground and releases them into the air.> One nasty bugger in particular, Overmaster Pyron, seems to be causing quite a bit of trouble. We need that elemental terminated so that our expedition crew can make its way into Blackrock Depths! He guards the entrance at the Blackrock Quarry.Incendius!^56^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Jalinda Sprig^Jalinda Sprig^Overmaster Pyron^^^Find Lord Incendius in Blackrock Depths and destroy him!^Are you sure Pyron said 'Incendius' when he died? <Jalinda swallows hard.> Lord Incendius is purported to be a minion of Ragnaros! Oh dear, oh dear... whatever will we do? Do you think you can handle another mission? I don't have anybody else to send, <name>! We will never get a team in if Incendius continues to raise Pyron from the ashes. You'll have to find and destroy Lord Incendius!Freed from the Hive^46^Alliance^Feralas^Zukk'ash Pod^Ginro Hearthkindle^Psychometric Reading^^^Free Raschal from the Zukk'ash hive.^The pod splits opens some when you touch it, revealing a night elven male who is surprisingly still alive. He seems to be in good health, though deeply stunned. As you help him down from the pod, he stirs to life. "Thank Elune - you've saved me, friend! I... I'm Raschal, and I awoke paralyzed inside this pod after these bugs overwhelmed me. Were you sent by the Stronghold?" It would seem that you've found the missing courier!A Hero's Welcome^46^Alliance^Feralas^Ginro Hearthkindle^Shandris Feathermoon^Psychometric Reading^^^Speak with Shandris Feathermoon in Feathermoon Stronghold.^<name>, General Shandris Feathermoon would like to speak with you personally. No doubt she wants to thank you for your service to the Stronghold, but I do know that she also wants to talk to you about the insect creatures that you and Raschal faced in southern Feralas. The reports of those Zukk'ash insects are... frightening, to say the least. General Feathermoon is waiting for you in the main compound.Rise of the Silithid^46^Alliance^Feralas^Shandris Feathermoon^Gracina Spiritmight^Psychometric Reading^^^Bring Raschal's Report to Gracina Spiritmight in Darnassus.^I am entrusting you with a copy of the report Raschal made on the infestation of southeastern Feralas. While the main report is being filed in Darnassus, I want you to give this copy to an associate of the Protectorate. Her name is Gracina Spiritmight; she is a priestess who dwells in the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus. She has broad knowledge on these kinds of creatures, and her receiving this report would benefit us all. You're dismissed - good luck, <name>; may Elune watch over us all.Thalanaar Delivery^44^Alliance^Feralas^Undelivered Parcel^Falfindel Waywarder^^^^Bring the Undelivered Parcel to Falfindel Waywarder in Thalanaar.^This parcel of goods you found in the Woodpaw gnoll camps was supposed to be delivered to the small way-station of Thalanaar in southeastern Feralas. Regardless of the missing courier's fate, the task of delivering the parcel remains unfinished. Examining the parcel in detail reveals a hand written name of "Falfindel Waywarder" on the outside of the packaging. Perhaps this is the parcel's ultimate recipient.FIFTY! YEP!^56^Alliance^Burning Steppes^Oralius^Oralius^^^^Collect 50 Blackrock Medallions.^I'm going to let you in on a little secret, soldier. Come a little closer. I'M THE ONLY SANE ONE HERE! Look at these people! Would you believe that they're all insane!? Well they are! NUTS! CRAZY! <Oralius lowers his voice.> Let's just keep that between me, you, and my pal Captain Winky. <Oralius grabs at the air and squeezes.> Anyhooooo... I'm collecting badges to go along with my ogre ear collection. Orc is the flavor of the day. Fifty. GO! <Oralius blows into a horn.> SHIP IT!Crystals of Power^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^J.D. Collie^^^The Northern Pylon, The Eastern Pylon, The Western Pylon^Collect 7 Power Crystals of each color: red, blue, yellow, and green. Bring them to J.D. Collie at Marshal's Refuge.^I'm sure you've noticed 'em, <name>. They're everywhere! What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course! The crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them. I've been doing experiments here with them for a while, but I can't seem to find anything. Well, I haven't yet, anyway. Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me?The Northern Pylon^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^J.D. Collie^^Crystals of Power^Making Sense of It^Discover the location of the Northern Crystal Pylon in Un'Goro Crater.^What could they be for? I can't get the thought out of my head! It's driving me crazy -- that the rumors I have heard about the crystal pylons are all true. Call me gullible, but I'll usually believe anything people tell me. Anyway, I have heard that there is one of the crystal pylons fairly close. Somewhere in the north... Please locate it, <name>. I just know they exist.The Good Stuff^56^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Oralius^Oralius^^^^Collect 20 Dark Iron Fanny Packs.^Captain Winky tells me that the Dark Irons in the Depths got all the good stuff. Ain't that right, Winky? <Oralius does his best impersonation of a pirate.> ARRR MATEY! IT BE RIGHT! See what I'm saying? You need to get in there and bring me back some samples of the good stuff. Get in there and shake your moneymaker!The Eastern Pylon^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^J.D. Collie^^Crystals of Power^Making Sense of It^Discover the location of the Eastern Crystal Pylon in Un'Goro Crater.^During my stay here, I have heard strange rumors about mysterious pylons existing out in the wilderness of the crater, <name>. I guess that they are quite large, with crystals lining their interiors. Although I've never seen one, I can't help but think that the rumors are true -- and that the pylons have something to do with all the crystals we found So why don't you help me put my curiosity to rest? Supposedly, there is one in the eastern area of the crater. Do you think you can find it?The Western Pylon^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^J.D. Collie^^Crystals of Power^Making Sense of It^Discover the location of the Western Crystal Pylon.^My experiments so far have not yielded any positive results, <name>. I can't help but hope that you can find a solution by searching for one of the pylons that I have heard exist. Perhaps if we combine certain colors at them... but I get ahead of myself. Let's find them first! <name>, search the western area of the crater; a pylon is said to be somewhere in that area.The Apes of Un'Goro^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^^^The Mighty U'cha^Bring 2 Un'Goro Gorilla Pelts, 2 Un'Goro Stomper Pelts, and 2 Un'Goro Thunderer Pelts to Torwa Pathfinder at the entrance of Un'Goro Crater.^This crater has many strange creatures--they seem to be nobler versions of the creatures found throughout my homeland and beyond. I cannot explain it, but this place cries of the Earth Mother. I pay homage to her every time I track one of her beautiful creatures across its basin. If you too wish to feel the enlightenment that accompanies such a great feat, then head to the north. There you'll find great apes who are a test for any mortal's strength. Bring me their pelts... prove your strength.The Fare of Lar'korwi^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^The Fare of Lar'korwi^^^Find the carcass of Lar'korwi's freshest kill and steal a Piece of Threshadon Carcass before returning to Torwa Pathfinder in Un'Goro Crater.^Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind. Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot. If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it. Return to me afterwards.The Scent of Lar'korwi^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^The Fare of Lar'korwi^^^Bring 2 Ravasaur Pheromone Glands to Torwa Pathfinder near the entrance to Un'Goro Crater.^I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, <name>. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us. Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands.The Bait for Lar'korwi^56^All^Un'Goro Crater^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^The Fare of Lar'korwi^^^Using the contents of Torwa's Pouch, summon Lar'korwi and defeat him. Then bring Lar'korwi's Head to Torwa Pathfinder near the entrance to Un'Goro Crater.^This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. To the north of here, you will find a small trail into the mountains. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last. You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby. Take the meat you recovered and place it there. Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat. If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will.A Sample of Slime...^52^Horde^Undercity^Chemist Fuely^Chemist Fuely^^^Melding of Influences^Gather Felwood Slime Samples from any of the slimes in Felwood. Then, using the Testing Equipment next to Chemist Fuely in Undercity, see which of your samples are the most corrupt. Bring 5 of the Corrupted Felwood Samples you find to Chemist Fuely.^Felwood is a forest far north of the Barrens, even farther than Ashenvale. There, slimes are found all around pools of water blessed by the touch of Fel. The Scourge decimated the area with attacks of Infernals and other demonic magics--the slimes supposedly crept up through the earth during these attacks. Gather samples of Felwood slimes and we will use the testing equipment next to me to create a control group for our tests against other samples you gather.... and a Batch of Ooze^56^Horde^Undercity^Chemist Fuely^Chemist Fuely^^^Melding of Influences^Gather Un'Goro Slime Samples from any of the slimes in Un'Goro Crater. Then, using the Testing Equipment next to Chemist Fuely in Undercity, see which of your samples are the most pure. Bring 5 of the Pure Un'Goro Samples you find to Chemist Fuely.^Have you heard of the Un'Goro Crater, <name>? It is near the Tanaris desert, and it is a magnificent place: lush, vibrant, full of creatures and plant life. It is there you must go. Word has reached me that the place seems completely untainted by outside hands. Explorers are just now discovering its secrets. I would like to test the slimes or oozes there. If it is true--that they are uncorrupt--then I would like to see how such creatures have evolved.Tablet of the Seven^50^All^Burning Steppes^Maxwort Uberglint^Maxwort Uberglint^^^^Collect the Tablet Transcript.^I came to the Burning Steppes, following the legends of the Seven. They were dwarves of great knowledge and power, and if you have knowledge and power, then wealth is sure to follow. That's what I want. Wealth! If we can learn more of the Seven, then maybe we can get rich together. The ruins of Thaurissan is rumored to keep the Tablet of the Seven, which holds knowledge of the ancient dwarves. Find this tablet, copy its text and bring it to me. Let's discover its secrets together!Food for Baby^47^Alliance^Feralas^Agnar Beastamer^Agnar Beastamer^The Newest Member of the Family^^^Bring 5 Silvermane Stalker Flanks to Agnar Beastamer in Hinterlands.^Sprite darters are omnivores--that means they eat both meat and vegetation. If your egg here's gonna hatch, we best be prepared. Some good eats for these little guys are flanks of meat, raw and juicy, believe it or not. I was never able to find out why, but it has somethin' to do with Elune's plan for the elves... maybe they were to be protectors or somethin', I don't know. I'll take care of the egg for now, why don't you get me some good Silvermane stalker flanks for 'em to eat when he's hatched.Becoming a Parent^48^Alliance^Feralas^Agnar Beastamer^Agnar Beastamer^The Newest Member of the Family^^^Speak to Agnar Beastamer in the Hinterlands.^Whoa, it was a lot more ready than I thought...Bone-Bladed Weapons^52^All^Orgrimmar^Jes'rimon^Jes'rimon^^^^Bring 8 White Ravasaur Claws to Jes'rimon in Orgrimmar.^Hmm, maybe there be somethin' you can do for the Hand now that me think 'bout it. Yes, Jes'rimon could use your help for sure. In Un'Goro Crater there be raptors with deadly claws. Some of those raptors sometimes have white claws instead of ones black like death. The Hand have... clients... that like weapons crafted from these claws. Bring me many of those white claws, and me pay you good coin. Do it fast enough, and maybe me help you in other ways.The Mighty U'cha^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^^The Apes of Un'Goro^^Bring U'cha's Pelt to Torwa Pathfinder at the entrance of Un'Goro Crater.^While you have been exploring Un'Goro, I have seen other things that a mighty hunter such as yourself would relish in. One such sight was a huge ape among the other gorillas to the north. You have been to that cave before, but this time, I wonder if you'll survive the encounter if you accept my task. I call him U'cha, and he is one of the Earth Mother's greatest sons, of that you can be sure. Defeat U'cha and bring me his pelt. Do this, and I will defend your right to call yourself a great hunter.Making Sense of It^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^J.D. Collie^J.D. Collie^^The Northern Pylon, The Eastern Pylon, The Western Pylon^Crystal Restore, Crystal Force, Crystal Ward, Crystal Yield, Crystal Charge, Crystal Spire^Speak with J.D. Collie in a moment.^The information you have given me about the pylons is very interesting... Give me a moment to do some calculations, <name>. Speak to me again in a moment and I should be able to give you the answer we have been looking for.Yuka Screwspigot^53^All^Blackrock Depths^Yorba Screwspigot^Yuka Screwspigot^Yuka Screwspigot^^^Speak with Yuka Screwspigot in the Burning Steppes.^Although my little brother Ribbly has been worthless his whole life, I think, finally, he has some value! But... we might need your help to capitalize on Ribbly's newfound worth. My sister Yuka has been looking for him for weeks, and tracked him to the Burning Steppes. She sent word to me, asking for some hired hands. So, what do you say? Want to help? If so, then speak with my sister. You'll find her holed up in Flame Crest, a cave northwest of Dreadmaul Rock.Kharan Mighthammer^59^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^King Magni Bronzebeard^Kharan Mighthammer^^The Smoldering Ruins of Thaurissan^Kharan's Tale^Travel to Blackrock Depths and find Kharan Mighthammer.^You have been to the smoldering ruins of Thaurissan? Did you happen to run into a pitiful lout named Kharan Mighthammer? The dwarf that was supposedly watching over my baby girl! <The King sobs.> And now she's gone, <name>! I have had my men turn the Steppes upside down. The only clue they have as to the whereabouts of my daughter is that she may be inside the Depths. For all I know, she could be dead! Kharan is supposedly being held prisoner there... find him! I want answers!Kharan's Tale^59^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Kharan Mighthammer^Kharan Mighthammer^Kharan's Tale^Kharan Mighthammer^^Listen as Kharan Mighthammer tells his story.^Please, hear me out before passing judgement!The Bearer of Bad News^59^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Kharan Mighthammer^King Magni Bronzebeard^Kharan's Tale^^^Return to Ironforge and deliver the bad news to King Magni Bronzebeard.^You must take this information back to King Magni, <name>. He will know what to do!The Fate of the Kingdom^59^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^King Magni Bronzebeard^Princess Moira Bronzebeard^Kharan's Tale^^^Return to Blackrock Depths and rescue Princess Moira Bronzebeard from the evil clutches of Emperor Dagran Thaurissan.^It would seem as if my old adversary, Dagran Thaurissan, has me and the kingdom of Ironforge at his mercy. You may be my last hope, <name>. You must rescue my dear daughter, Moira! There is only one way to make sure that the spell Thaurissan has cast on Moira is broken: Kill him. And <name>, do not harm her! Remember, she is being controlled by Thaurissan! The things she may do or say are a result of Thaurissan's evil spell!The Princess's Surprise^59^Alliance^Blackrock Depths^Princess Moira Bronzebeard^King Magni Bronzebeard^Kharan's Tale^^^Return to Ironforge and speak with King Magni Bronzebeard.^Thaurissan was a great and honorable dwarf. You ruined my life and the life of my unborn child! <You think that Princess Bronzebeard may still be suffering from the residual effect of the Emperor's spell.> Return to Ironforge and tell my father that the heir to the Kingdom of Ironforge will be a Dark Iron dwarf. Whether he approves or not, it shall be.Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise^3^All^Durotar^Galgar^Galgar^^Cutting Teeth^^Bring Galgar 6 Cactus Apples. You remember him saying that they could be found near cactuses.^It sure gets hot out here in the Valley of Trials. <Galgar wipes his brow.> If only I had some cactus apples, I could make my famous cactus apple surprise! Nothing cools you off faster than a piece of that delicious treat. I'll tell you what, <name>. If you bring me 6 cactus apples, I'll make you a few portions of cactus apple surprise to take with you on your adventures. If you're interested, you can find cactus apples growing near the cactus plants around here.The Corruption of the Jadefire^54^Alliance^Felwood^Eridan Bluewind^Eridan Bluewind^^^Further Corruption^Kill 11 Jadefire Felsworns, 9 Jadefire Shadowstalkers, 9 Jadefire Rogues, and Xavathras. Return to Eridan Bluewind in Felwood when the task has been completed.^Not many seek adventure here... Felwood's corruption is widespread and indiscriminate. As part of the Emerald Circle, I seek to heal this land, but there are some that wish it to fester. The ones I speak of are the Jadefire satyrs that dwell to the northwest of here, at the Ruins of Constellas. Led by a particularly cruel satyr named Xavathras, they continue to spread the disease to any creatures they encounter. We must defend this land that was once ours. Defeat Xavathras and destroy his minions.Felbound Ancients^54^Alliance^Felwood^Eridan Bluewind^Eridan Bluewind^Flute of Xavaric^^Purified!^Travel to Darnassus and use Eridan's Vial to collect a Vial of Blessed Water from the Temple of the Moon. Return to Eridan with the filled vial.^The flute you found was carved from an ancient protector, the treant allies that have faithfully protected the night elves. The satyrs have been able to corrupt anything they come in contact with, which includes the ancients that made Felwood their home. By the use of the fel, the spirit of the ancient has been bound and tortured, never completely released. The felbind you found is no doubt related. We must try to purify the flute, <name>. Bring me blessed water from the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus.Purified!^54^Alliance^Felwood^Eridan Bluewind^Eridan Bluewind^^Felbound Ancients^Ancient Spirit^Speak to Eridan again in a moment.^Using the water of Elune, I will attempt to purify the flute. We must end this suffering... May Elune guide my hands and heart. Speak with me again in a moment.Caught!^45^All^Searing Gorge^Wooden Outhouse^Wooden Outhouse^Caught!^^^Kill 8 Dark Iron Geologists and bring 15 pieces of Silk Cloth to the person locked in the outhouse in Searing Gorge.^Hey! Hey, you! Get over here! Ya gotta help me out. I was runnin' from them Dark Iron dwarves, and I hid in here to get out of sight. Damn geologists and their magic ways! They musta seen me hide, cause next thing I knew, they locked the door and stuck me in here. Teach them geologists a lesson! Oh... an' can ya get me some pieces of silk cloth for... for... nothin'.Ledger from Tanaris^46^All^Searing Gorge^Wooden Outhouse^Krinkle Goodsteel^Caught!^^^Take the copy of Goodsteel's Ledger and then find the items listed in it before seeking Krinkle Goodsteel in Tanaris.^Oh, you know what? That reminds me. You wanna finish up a little job I took up while I was in Tanaris? It's easy... Krinkle Goodsteel in Gadgetzan was lookin' for some stuff found here in Searing Gorge and a few other places. Maybe you could take a look at the list and then bring it all to him? I'll just slide his ledger under the door if you're interested. Take that, and the stuff he wants back to him after ya collected it all.The Key to Freedom^47^All^Searing Gorge^Grimesilt Outhouse Key^Wooden Outhouse^^^^Search Searing Gorge and find a use for the Grimesilt Outhouse Key you have found.^The small brass key looks simple enough.. The only thing that seems to make it stand out are some words scratched into the head of it: "Dark Iron Outhouse - Do Not Duplicate." You have no idea what it means or what it will lead to.The Tome of Nobility^40^Alliance^Paladin^Arthur the Faithful^Duthorian Rall^^^^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^Hello, <name>. I see your dedication remains strong, as does your faith. I think it is time you spoke with Duthorian Rall in Stormwind. There are some more lessons for you to learn, and I feel you are prepared. Seek him out in the Cathedral of Light, and <name>, take these lessons seriously. You've attained your status through humility and hard work, do not disappoint us by becoming arrogant. Be well.The Tome of Nobility^40^Alliance^Paladin^Brandur Ironhammer^Duthorian Rall^^^^Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.^Well, well, well, look at the mighty paladin in all <his/her> regality. Sorry, <name>, I meant no offense... I just get a little jealous sometimes when I see some of the feats you've accomplished. Tiza tells me it's my weakness, and I swore to her I'd work on it. It's just hard sometimes, you know? But the reason I wanted to talk to you was because Duthorian Rall in Stormwind sent word for you to meet him in the Cathedral of Light when you're ready. Sounded important. Sounded like something's going on.A Little Help From My Friends^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Ringo^Spraggle Frock^^Lost!^^Lead Ringo to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Refuge.^Ugh... It's so hot... I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion. Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Refuge. I think I'm well enough to follow you there. I am feeling a little out of it, so if I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope...Lost!^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Spraggle Frock^Ringo^^^A Little Help From My Friends^Find Ringo at Fire Plume Ridge.^You've got to help me, <name>! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the south of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him. Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it!March of the Silithid^53^All^Darnassus^Gracina Spiritmight^Alchemist Pestlezugg^March of the Silithid^^^Speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg in Gadgetzan.^It would seem that the silithid's intent, nay - reason for being, is to devour everything in their path that is not of their ecology. Their focus is singular, and it is for this reason they are a grave threat to all life on Azeroth. What we've seen to date is but the first stages. I suspect that their strength comes from deeper in Kalimdor: Un'Goro Crater. Go to Gadgetzan in the Tanaris desert and speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg. Tell him of my theory; he will surely aid us in fighting the silithid.March of the Silithid^53^All^Orgrimmar^Zilzibin Drumlore^Alchemist Pestlezugg^March of the Silithid^^^Speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg in Gadgetzan.^It would seem that the silithid's intent, nay - reason for being, is to devour everything in their path that is not of their ecology. Their focus is singular, and it is for this reason they are a grave threat to all life on Azeroth. What we've seen to date is but the first stages. I suspect that their strength comes from deeper in Kalimdor: Un'Goro Crater. Go to Gadgetzan in the Tanaris desert and speak to Alchemist Pestlezugg. Tell him of my theory; he will surely aid us in fighting the silithid.A Good Friend^4^All^Teldrassil^Dirania Silvershine^Iverron^^^A Friend in Need^Find Iverron by the cave to the north.^A friend of mine named Iverron usually visits me at the same time every day. The strange thing is that he hasn't been by today at all -- he's several hours late, in fact. I admit, I am a little worried, <name>. Iverron spends a lot of time over by the cave to the north, and I'm sure you know how dangerous it is there -- spiders, everywhere! If you happen to be going that way, though, will you keep an eye out for him?Bungle in the Jungle^53^All^Tanaris^Alchemist Pestlezugg^Alchemist Pestlezugg^March of the Silithid^^Pawn Captures Queen^Bring a Gorishi Scent Gland and 5 Un'Goro Soil samples to Alchemist Pestlezugg in Gadgetzan.^My research revealed to me that the silithid are like bees; destroy the queen of the hive, and the rest of should be thrown into disarray. I'll brew a lure that we'll use to bring out the queen; once summoned, you'll take her down. First though, we need some reagents; we don't want you bungling into the jungle unprepared. Go west to find the silithid hive in Un'Goro Crater and obtain a scent gland from one of the bugs. I'll also need some samples of the native Un'Goro soil.Beware of Pterrordax^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Beware of Pterrordax^Spraggle Frock^^^^Kill 10 Frenzied Pterrordax, then speak to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Refuge.^Wanted: A skilled fighter to deal with the threat of the Pterrordax that inhabit the Un'Goro Crater. Their numbers are growing, and they are becoming a menace to travelers in the area. Decrease the population by slaying 10 frenzied pterrordax. Speak with Spraggle Frock after completing the task for a reward.Volcanic Activity^55^All^Un'Goro Crater^Liv Rizzlefix^Liv Rizzlefix^^^^Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the fire elementals around the volcano in Un'Goro Crater, and return them to Liv Rizzlefix in Ratchet.^Being an apprentice to Marvon Rivetseeker, I've learned so much. But he's been gone for such a long time now, so I think I'm going to work on some experiments of my own. I've been reading about Un'Goro Crater most recently, and about the strange volcanic activity going on in the middle of the crater. I think a lot could be learned if I could just get some of the ash from the elementals there. Do you think you'd mind collecting some for me, if you are going that way?Shizzle's Flyer^51^All^Un'Goro Crater^Shizzle^Shizzle^^^^Collect 8 Webbed Diemetradon Scales and 8 Webbed Pterrordax Scales for Shizzle in Marshal's Refuge.^I'm making a flying machine! I got stranded here, and I'm absolutely horrible at finding my way around. I'd take a gryphon or wind rider back to Gadgetzan, but those beasts just scare me to death. So, will you help me? All I have left to build is the wings, and I was thinking that the webby scales from the pterrordax and diemetradon would be perfect. There's no way I'm going to go up against one of those, but you look pretty tough. Why don't you give it a try?Super Sticky^54^All^Tanaris^Tran'rek^Tran'rek^^^^Collect 12 samples of Super Sticky Tar for Tran'rek in Gadgetzan.^I'm always looking for a quick way to earn a gold, <name>. If you help me with my newest idea, I'll let you in on a little of the profit. How does that sound to you? I thought so! Head to the tar pits in northern Un'Goro Crater, and collect me some tar. Not just any tar, now, you'll need to get it from the beasts that live around the tar pits. Regular tar just simply isn't sticky enough. The plant-like creatures contain chlorophyll in their skin, and mixed with the tar, it's super sticky!Well of Corruption^54^Horde^Felwood^Winna Hazzard^Winna Hazzard^A Strange One^^Corrupted Sabers^Collect a sample of corrupted water from the Jadefire Satyrs' moonwell and bring it to Winna Hazzard at Bloodvenom Post.^Some may say that I am exceptionally cruel... But truly, it is only a strong desire to see the Horde gain an advantage against the Alliance, in any way possible. My newest interest is a moonwell at the Ruins of Constellas, south of here, tended by the Jadefire satyrs. The moonwell, once a symbol of renewal for the insufferable night elves, is now corrupted, and used to bring forth more satyrs. I have an idea, <name>, and I'd like a sample of the water... for my little feline friend here.Corrupted Sabers^54^Horde^Felwood^Winna Hazzard^Winna Hazzard^^Well of Corruption^^Take Winna's kitten to the corrupted moonwell, release it, then bring it back to Winna.^This corrupted water can be used to our advantage, <name>. With just a small amount of the water, my kitten doubled in size, and seems to be stronger... somehow. These cats may prove useful... Here, <name>. Take this cat carrier, and release the kitten inside next to the moonwell in the Ruins of Constellas. Heh, heh... I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results! Return the cat to me, and I'm sure I can make it worth your time.Pawn Captures Queen^54^All^Tanaris^Alchemist Pestlezugg^Alchemist Pestlezugg^^Bungle in the Jungle^Calm Before the Storm, Calm Before the Storm^Defeat the Gorishi Hive Queen once she is summoned.^Here's the lure. Inside the hive network should be a crystal of some sort. We think the silithid use the crystal as some sort of hive-wide attunement device. As for where this crystal might be, I'd say try the hatcheries inside the hive. Using the lure on the crystal should roust out the queen, but be warned - she will probably be protected by several guards. Take out the queen and remove her brain. As icky as that sounds, we desperately need to study it. Good luck, <name>!Calm Before the Storm^54^Alliance^Tanaris^Alchemist Pestlezugg^Gracina Spiritmight^Calm Before the Storm^Pawn Captures Queen^^Bring Pestlezugg's Un'Goro Report to Gracina Spiritmight in Darnassus.^My recent findings and the knowledge we have gained here today needs to reach hands that can quite possibly do something with it. As resourceful as we are here in Gadgetzan, we can't do this alone. Take my latest report back to Gracina Spiritmight in Darnassus; she's still at the Temple of the Moon, is she not? She's got friends who are Alliance bigwigs; if we can get them involved in this <name>, then we just might make it out of this alive.Calm Before the Storm^54^Horde^Tanaris^Alchemist Pestlezugg^Zilzibin Drumlore^Calm Before the Storm^Pawn Captures Queen^^Bring Pestlezugg's Un'Goro Report to Zilzibin Drumlore in Orgrimmar.^My recent findings and the knowledge we have gained here today needs to reach hands that can quite possibly do something with it. As resourceful as we are here in Gadgetzan, we can't do this alone. Take my latest report back to Zilzibin Drumlore in Orgrimmar; he's still in his place on the upper part of the Drag, is he not? He's got friends who are high within the Horde; if we can get them involved in this <name>, then we just might make it out of this alive.Calm Before the Storm^54^Alliance^Darnassus^Gracina Spiritmight^Idriana^Calm Before the Storm^^^Bring the Bank Voucher to Idriana in the bank of Darnassus.^<name>, your help has been immeasurable. The time will come, no doubt, when I'll ask for your assistance against the silithid once more. We must absorb what we have learned in Un'Goro; I fear that my assumptions that the silithid originated from Un'Goro are now wrong... that indeed there is a far stronger presence somewhere. Take this note to Idriana at the bank. She'll give you something from my vault that should be viewed as a token of my gratitude. Thank you for your assistance, brave <class>.Calm Before the Storm^54^Horde^Orgrimmar^Zilzibin Drumlore^Karus^Calm Before the Storm^^^Bring the Bank Voucher to Karus in the bank of Orgrimmar.^<name>, we could not have gotten this far without you. The time will come soon, no doubt, when I'll ask for your help against the silithid once more. We must absorb what we have learned in Un'Goro; I fear that my assumptions that the silithid originated from Un'Goro are now wrong... that indeed there is a far stronger presence somewhere. Take this note to Karus at the bank. He'll give you something from my vault that should be viewed as a token of my gratitude. Thank you for your assistance, mighty <class>.A Little Slime Goes a Long Way^52^Alliance^Ironforge^Laris Geardawdle^Laris Geardawdle^^^A Little Slime Goes a Long Way^Bring 6 Filled Cursed Ooze Jars and 6 Filled Tainted Ooze Jars to Laris Geardawdle in Ironforge.^But the thing I've studied most is ooze. I know it sounds odd, but they're all over! I helped a lady in Menethil find her bag not too long ago--it was eaten by oozes. I've seen members of the Royal Apothecary Society from Undercity collecting samples of the stuff. I want to know why! Where does it come from? I've heard of more in Felwood. What I need are samples of the oozes there so I can further my research. I'll give you containers, you use them to collect a sample from the deceased creatures.A Little Slime Goes a Long Way^54^Alliance^Ironforge^Laris Geardawdle^Laris Geardawdle^^A Little Slime Goes a Long Way^^Bring 10 Filled Pure Sample Jars to Laris Geardawdle in Ironforge.^I'm going to need more samples, <name>. But--and I don't know how to put this--they have to be pure samples. I know, I know. "What does 'pure' mean, Laris?" I'm not sure. I do know that these are corrupt... just like Felwood. Which is what makes my realization so important. The oozes seem to adapt... to take on the aspects of the area they're in. I'll need to find samples that haven't been polluted. But where? Where?! Bah! <name>, take these containers just in case you find any on your own.Wild Guardians^56^Horde^Felwood^Trull Failbane^Trull Failbane^Wild Guardians^^^Trull Failbane in Felwood wants you to kill 15 Raging Owlbeasts and 15 Ragged Owlbeasts.^Winterspring lies just beyond Timbermaw, northeast of Felwood. Have you been there? I have heard that the area is laden with creatures called wildkin. These beasts have been known to guard secrets; secrets of the Night elves. We must figure out what may be hidden in Winterspring. I have heard the ragged owlbeasts can be found just south of the road, and that there are others called raging owlbeasts that may be found in the center of Winterspring. Clear them out, and gain access to the land.Kayneth Stillwind^29^Alliance^Ashenvale^Shindrell Swiftfire^Kayneth Stillwind^^^Forsaken Diseases^Take Shindrell's Note to Kayneth Stillwind in Forest Song.^The druid Kayneth Stillwind sent word to me. He would like a report of the happenings along our coast and in the forests surrounding Astranaar. He fears there is a corruption moving through Ashenvale... and he may be right. Here, take my report to him. You will find him in the shrine of Forest Song, in the Nightsong Woods to the east.The Sparklematic 5200!^30^All^Dun Morogh^The Sparklematic 5200^The Sparklematic 5200^^^The Sparklematic 5200!^Insert a Grime-Encrusted Item into the Sparklematic 5200, and be sure to have three silver coins to start the machine.^This contraption stands out amongst the gnomes holding out against the madness outside the room. A small plaque on the device reads "The Sparklematic 5200", followed by some text: "Grime and residue ruining your sparklies? The Sparklematic 5200 puts the shine back in shine-tastic! Insert the item you wish to clean and deposit three silver coins in the coin slot. Give the Sparklematic 5200 a moment for operation, and voila! Your valuables will emerge clean and shiny!"The Sparklematic 5200!^30^All^Dun Morogh^The Sparklematic 5200^The Sparklematic 5200^^^The Sparklematic 5200!^Insert a Grime-Encrusted Item into the Sparklematic 5200, and be sure to have three silver coins to start the machine.^This contraption stands out amongst the gnomes holding out against the madness outside the room. A small plaque on the device reads "The Sparklematic 5200", followed by some text: "Grime and residue ruining your sparklies? The Sparklematic 5200 puts the shine back in shine-tastic!

Your valuables will emerge clean and shiny!"Avast Ye, Admiral!^60^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Fleet Master Firallon^Fleet Master Firallon^Avast Ye, Scallywag^^^Slay Fleet Master Seahorn and Baron Revilgaz of Booty Bay, and then return to Fleet Master Firallon aboard the Crimson Veil off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.^Listen close, sea dawg... the powers of Booty Bay is what keeps us Bloodsail from sailing wheres we like and taking whats we want as rights o' plunder. Were ye to put a knife to Fleet Master Seahorn, we'd ne'er run afoul of a Booty Bay's vessel. Were ye to put a knife to Baron Revilgaz, we'd ne'er face the law on their terms. If ye are to be an honorary admiral amongst us - yes, ADMIRAL, you'll puts a knife to both of 'em as I've says. Go now <lad /lass>, and return to me once ye does the deeds.Your Place In The World^1^Horde^Durotar^Kaltunk^Gornek^Your Place In The World^^^Speak with Gornek. You recall Kaltunk marking your map with his location and mentioning that Gornek resided in the Den, a building to the west.^Finally, you are of age, <name>... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief. Yes... <Kaltunk looks you over.> You will do nicely. No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous. <Kaltunk laughs.> Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young <class>. You will find Gornek in the Den, to the west.Melding of Influences^55^Horde^Undercity^Chemist Fuely^Chemist Fuely^^A Sample of Slime..., ... and a Batch of Ooze^^Bring a Merged Ooze Sample to Chemist Fuely in Undercity.^Here is some encased ooze created from the Felwood samples you recovered. Take the case to Un'Goro Crater and find a pure ooze... the primal variety will do nicely. When you get close enough, release the ooze in the case, and let us see what the two think of one another. After the experiment concludes, bring me a sample of whatever is left over. I will await you here in the Apothecarium.Washed Ashore^14^All^Darkshore^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^Washed Ashore^^Beached Sea Turtle, Beached Sea Creature, Beached Sea Turtle, Beached Sea Turtle, Beached Sea Creature, Beached Sea Creature, Beached Sea Turtle, Beached Sea Turtle, Beached Sea Creature^Recover the Sea Turtle Remains from the Skeletal Sea Turtle in the waters west of Auberdine, and then speak with Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde back in Auberdine.^That beached creature is not an isolated incident here in Darkshore. There are more along the coastline and even in the water. I would like for you to investigate another one that we know of; this one was reported to be in the water due west of Auberdine, close to a sunken vessel. Return to me with anything that you may recover that would aid our research. Also, in your travels you may find other creatures. By all means, if you should discover anything then please bring it to our attention!Put Her Down^59^All^Blackrock Spire^Helendis Riverhorn^Helendis Riverhorn^^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and destroy the source of the worg menace. As you left Helendis, he shouted a name: Halycon. It is what the orcs refer to in regards to the worg.^You have no doubt seen the worgs which the Blackrock orcs command. It is curious - no matter how many we destroy, their numbers never dwindle. My scouts have reported that the worgs are bred, trained, and ultimately exported from Blackrock Spire: capital city of the Blackrock orcs. You must travel to Blackrock Spire and discover the source of this menace. Discover... and destroy. Good luck, <name>. May Cenarius protect you...Wild Guardians^59^Horde^Felwood^Trull Failbane^Trull Failbane^Wild Guardians^^^Trull Failbane in Felwood wants you to hunt 10 Berserk Owlbeasts in Winterspring.^Runners have returned from Winterspring with reports that there is a series of small caves in the southern area of Winterspring. It seems that there are wildkin situated in the area around these caves. If there is something valuable that they are guarding, I believe that this is the place we will find it. You will find these to be more of a challenge than the previous types, <name>. The creatures seem to have gone mad from exposure to the very thing that they strive to protect.Beached Sea Turtle^13^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Turtle^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Turtle Remains to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^You find a corpse of a sea turtle that had beached itself on the coast of Darkshore some time ago. It has been scavenged by the murlocs who have encamped themselves around the creature's remains. Still, there appear to be some suitable samples left on the creature's remains that Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine might be able to make use of.Beached Sea Creature^13^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Creature^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^The remains of a giant thresher - much larger than one you'd expect to find in Darkshore - lie beached on the coast of the Mist's Edge. How this creature came to be here is unknown; the group of murlocs that now feast off the carcass of it seem to be much too weak, even in large numbers, to have brought down the beast. While some of it has been picked clean, enough of it remains to take a sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine to study.The Pack Mistress^59^Horde^Blackrock Spire^Galamav the Marksman^Galamav the Marksman^^^^Slay Halycon, pack mistress of the Bloodaxe worg.^Some say the worg controlled by the Blackrock orcs are the creation of a supernatural force. Others say they are not true worg but instead a breed of demon dog, granted to the orcs by a fallen pit lord. The truth is far less contrived but every bit as frightening. The worg of Blackrock come from Halycon and her mate. Halycon is the gigantic den mother of the worg. Her mate? Nobody has ever lived to tell the tale of that one. Strike at the heart of the worg. Destroy Halycon... and <name>, watch your back.Beached Sea Turtle^15^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Turtle^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Strangely Marked Box to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^More sea turtle remains lie beached along the coastline. This particular set has an abandoned carriage attached to the turtle's shell. Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested. Greymist murlocs now make the remains of this creature their home, feasting off the carrion. In the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it.Broodling Essence^52^All^Burning Steppes^Tinkee Steamboil^Tinkee Steamboil^Broodling Essence^^^Bring 8 Broodling Essence and the Draco-Incarcinatrix 900 to Tinkee Steamboil at the Flame Crest in the Burning Steppes.^I have been studying the dragonkin of the Burning Steppes for weeks, and I think I've finally had a breakthrough! I created a device--I call it the Draco Incarcinatrix 900. It can capture the essence of dragon whelp broodlings! Or, at least I think it can. Here, take the device and zap a broodling in the Burning Steppes with it. While it's under the device's effects, defeat the broodling and its essence should be released. If it is, then splendid! Bring me back samples so I can study them!Beached Sea Turtle^15^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Turtle^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Turtle Remains to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^The skeletal remains of a sea turtle lie in the sand of the northern Darkshore beaches. The Greymist murlocs have either not found this carcass, or perhaps they have and are shying away from it for some unknown reason. Regardless, there is enough of the turtle left to take a sample back to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine for the Temple of the Moon to study.Beached Sea Creature^14^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Creature^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^The corpse of what appears to be some sort of giant sea mammal lies partially gutted on the beach. A wheelbarrow and various tools lie abandoned by this enormous beached sea creature, as though an attempt to study it had been made previously. Though murlocs have scavenged this beast, enough of it remains to gather a suitable sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.Kibler's Exotic Pets^59^All^Blackrock Spire^Kibler^Kibler^^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and find Bloodaxe Worg Pups. Use the cage to carry the ferocious little beasts. Bring back a Caged Worg Pup to Kibler.^You're probably wondering what I'm doing out here. Look at the cages! Ain't it obvious? I'm an animal lover, first and foremost, but a salesman by trade. I track down exotic animals for the rich and famous and domesticate the beasts so they behave as proper pets. Now you're probably wondering, "What can I do for you, Kibler." The answer is simple: Take this here beast cage and find me some worg pups. For that, I'll domesticate a worg for you!Beached Sea Creature^16^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Creature^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^The half-devoured corpse of what might have been a giant sea mammal lies on the beach. A band of murlocs, stronger than those found closer to Auberdine, have taken up residence around the fallen creature. Enough of the creature remains that a suitable sample of its bones could be delivered to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.Beached Sea Turtle^19^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Turtle^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Strangely Marked Box to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^Another set of sea turtle remains lie beached on the coastline. This set of remains has an abandoned carriage half buckled to the turtle's shell. Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested. Powerful Greymist murlocs have made the carcass of this creature their current home. In the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it.Beached Sea Turtle^19^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Turtle^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Turtle Remains to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^You find a corpse of a sea turtle that had beached itself on the coast of Darkshore some time ago. It has been picked nearly clean by Greymist murlocs, the very ones who now have encamped themselves around the creature's remains. Still, there appear to be some suitable samples left on the creature's remains that Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine might be able to make use of.Beached Sea Creature^19^Alliance^Darkshore^Beached Sea Creature^Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde^^Washed Ashore^^Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.^The remains of what appear to be a giant thresher have washed ashore on the rocky inlet of the Twilight Shore. The thresher is several times larger than any of the other threshers spotted in these parts. Wherever it came from, this creature would not seem to have been native to Darkshore. Though the creature has been picked apart in places, enough of it remains to gather a suitable sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.Egg Freezing^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Tinkee Steamboil^Tinkee Steamboil^Tinkee Steamboil^^Egg Collection, Leonid Barthalomew^Use the Eggscilloscope Prototype on an egg in the Rookery of Blackrock Spire.^<name>, I've been working hard on a new device, the eggscilloscope! It's designed to project a burst of cold energy at the egg of a black dragon... and freeze it solid! Can you test it for me? I heard that high up in Blackrock Spire, the dragons have a rookery where they hatch their eggs. That's where you'll have to go to test the eggscilloscope, and then let me know how it worked! And don't worry. Frozen dragon eggs should be harmless. It's the unfrozen ones you have to worry about!Egg Collection^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Tinkee Steamboil^Tinkee Steamboil^^Egg Freezing^Leonid Barthalomew^Bring 8 Collected Dragon Eggs and the Collectronic Module to Tinkee Steamboil at Flame Crest in the Burning Steppes.^<name>, I'm finally ready for real samples of dragon eggs! Here, take this collectronic module. It's designed to extract a dragon egg and prepare it for transport. Go back to the Rookery and use the module to collect eggs. And don't forget to freeze them first, or they might hatch before you can collect them! When you have enough eggs, bring them to me!In Search of Menara Voidrender^31^Alliance^Warlock^Briarthorn^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Ah, hello, <name>. You're progressing well in your training. So well in fact that I think you should be rewarded for your hard work--and for not becoming corrupted by the arcane yet. If you're interested, seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She is currently staying at Strahad Farsan's tower overlooking the town. She's not very friendly, <name>, so don't expect any praise. But if you work hard, she'll make sure you're taken care of.In Search of Menara Voidrender^31^Horde^Warlock^Zevrost^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Hmph, still you strive to become more powerful. I say it's only time before the corruption and addiction takes hold of you and you become a slave to that which you seek to gain power over. Pfah! A fool you are! Time will prove me right--nothing else... just time. But it seems that not all agree with Zevrost. It seems Menara would create tools for you to become more powerful and to harness your strength. If you're interested, then go to Ratchet in the Barrens. She is there overlooking the town.In Search of Menara Voidrender^31^Alliance^Warlock^Demisette Cloyce^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Speak with Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Let us be clear about one thing, <name>: I don't feel you are ready for such responsibilities. I don't think aiding in the creation of any item of power is something a novice should ever be involved in; especially one so untested. But that's not my decision. The powers that be, or at least the ones that do wish to impart such gifts upon you get to decide that. If you're interested in learning more, I suggest you seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She usually resides in the tower above the port town.In Search of Menara Voidrender^31^Horde^Warlock^Kaal Soulreaper^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^<class>! Yes, you! You don't have all the accoutrements, but it's plain to see you're ready--the air around you exudes greater confidence. Yes, I see it now. Menara Voidrender would teach you a few things if you feel you're ready. She spends her time tutoring younger students in the arcane. She even gives gifts to those who pass her tests. Go to Ratchet in the Barrens if you're interested. She's above the city in Strahad's tower.WANTED: Murkdeep!^18^All^Darkshore^WANTED: Murkdeep!^Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea^^^^Find and slay the murloc known as Murkdeep. The creature is thought to be defending the murloc huts south of Auberdine along the water.^Attention! A reward is being offered for the death of the murloc "Murkdeep". This foul beast is known to be responsible for the death of at least one Sentinel, and is suspected of causing the sinking of at least two cargo vessels in the waters off Darkshore! Murkdeep was last spotted at a hutted murloc camp south of Auberdine, and is thought to be protecting the huts there. Reward claims for this bounty should be claimed with Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine. The Auberdine Village CouncilWild Guardians^58^Horde^Felwood^Trull Failbane^Trull Failbane^Wild Guardians^^^Trull Failbane in Felwood wants you to hunt 13 Moontouched Owlbeasts.^In the northern areas of Winterspring, the Wildkin grow even more ferocious. We must continue our measures there. Hunt the moontouched owlbeasts in Winterspring, and explore the area they inhabit. This is dangerous ground, but I know that you will be able to handle the challenge. Return to me after you have slain 13 of the wildkin.Seal of Ascension^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Vaelan^Vaelan^Seal of Ascension^^^Find the three gemstones of command: The Gemstone of Smolderthorn, Gemstone of Spirestone, and Gemstone of Bloodaxe. Return them, along with the Unadorned Seal of Ascension, to Vaelan.^As you can see, the unadorned seal has three empty sockets. Each of those sockets must be filled with a gemstone representing the leadership's command. Finally, Overlord Wyrmthalak, master of the lower citadel, must forge the seal in the flames of the Black Dragonflight. Understand this, mortal: the chance that one of the three generals of the lower citadel would carry a gemstone at any given time is rare. You must be vigilant in your quest. Remain determined!Seal of Ascension^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Vaelan^Vaelan^Seal of Ascension^^^Travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh. Find the ancient drake, Emberstrife and beat him without mercy until his will is broken.^Few of the black dragonkin, outside of those in the upper citadel, have the ability to forge the seal with their own flaming breath. Wyrmthalak is one such dragonkin, but his will is unbreakable. You must travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh. It is there that you will find an ancient drake known as Emberstrife. You must break his will, <name>. Break it and use this orb on his weakened form. You will have scant seconds to control his mind and fan the flames that will forge the seal.Thundris Windweaver^15^All^Darkshore^Terenthis^Thundris Windweaver^Thundris Windweaver^How Big a Threat?^^Speak with Thundris Windweaver in Auberdine.^Your scouting of the furbolg camp is information that Thundris Windweaver should be made aware of. He graciously serves as the elder of Auberdine, offering sage and just stewardship of the day to day affairs of the village. Please - share with him your findings to date on the furbolg situation. I believe he has some ideas of his own on the reasons behind their corruption. Perhaps you can work with him to enact a plan to restore the balance of nature here!The Cliffspring River^15^All^Darkshore^Thundris Windweaver^Thundris Windweaver^Thundris Windweaver^^The Blackwood Corrupted^Travel north of Auberdine to the first waterfall along the Cliffspring River and draw a sample from the pool there.^The Cliffspring River has begun turning foul and corrupted. It empties into the Mist's Edge, and I fear the wash will affect Auberdine soon. I suspect the Blackwood furbolgs up-river are the cause of the taint, but I also suspect that they aren't the true root of it. Take this sampling tube and go to the mouth of the river to our north. Proceed inland to the first waterfall and draw a sample from the pool there. You'll see a bridge overhead. Once you have a sample, return to me in Auberdine.The Blackwood Corrupted^18^All^Darkshore^Thundris Windweaver^Thundris Windweaver^^The Cliffspring River^^Fill the Empty Cleansing Bowl at the Auberdine Moonwell.^We've learned that a source of furbolg corruption is from the satyr. They hold sway via talismans that they channel magic through. If the furbolg have a chance at salvation, we must lure out the satyr corruptor and take that talisman! Fill this bowl at our moonwell and take samples of the furbolgs' food from their northern camp. Mix them and place it near the bonfire by the river; any furbolgs who eat will be cleansed just long enough to lure out the satyr corruptor... who then you must slay!Doomrigger's Clasp^60^Alliance^Blackrock Spire^Mayara Brightwing^Mayara Brightwing^Mayara Brightwing^^^Bring Doomrigger's Clasp to Mayara Brightwing in the Burning Steppes.^There is a chamber, high in Blackrock Spire, that was once called the Hall of Fortune. It was where the Dark Iron dwarves kept their relics, trophies and objects of art. That was long ago. It is said the hall has collapsed and is now used for... less savory tasks. But I believe some old dwarven relics may still be found there. One such relic is Doomrigger's clasp, with a surface so encrusted with rare gems that it was said to make weep any dwarf who gazes upon it. That clasp, <name>, is your goal.Delivery to Ridgewell^60^Alliance^Blackrock Spire^Mayara Brightwing^Count Remington Ridgewell^Mayara Brightwing^^^Bring Ridgewell's Crate to Count Remington Ridgewell at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind.^I have packaged Doomriggers Clasp into a crate, suitable for shipment to Stormwind. <name>, you have been extremely helpful -- can I ask you for one last favor? Deliver the crate to Count Remington Ridgewell. You will find him in the Keep of Stormwind. I am sure he'll be very pleased to see what you have for him.Mayara Brightwing^60^Alliance^Blackrock Spire^Count Remington Ridgewell^Mayara Brightwing^Mayara Brightwing^^^Speak with Mayara Brightwing at Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes.^An agent of mine, Mayara Brightwing, was sent to the Burning Steppes to scout the ruined city of Thaurissan. That destroyed city of the Dark Iron dwarves may hide objects of great value... objects that would fit nicely into our family museum. Mayara says she found something and will need aid in retrieving it, but it is not in Thaurissan. Instead, a foray into Blackrock Spire will be required. I do not know the details, but if interested then speak with Mayara in the Burning Steppes.Wind Rider^29^Horde^Thousand Needles^Elu^Elu^^^^Bring 10 Highperch Wyvern Eggs to Elu in Freewind Post.^I've been tasked to recruit more wyverns for the master wind riders. Their numbers are growing and I myself hope to become a wind rider one day. However, we cannot train enough wyverns to keep up with the demand. Perhaps you can help me, <name>. I need you to travel to Highperch to gather some wyvern eggs. From here, head northwest along the canyon walls to a ramp that will lead you into Highperch. Be careful, wyverns are very protective over their eggs and they will not be kind to intruders.The Darkstone Tablet^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Vivian Lagrave and the Darkstone Tablet^^^Bring the Darkstone Tablet to Shadow Mage Vivian Lagrave in Kargath.^The Darkstone Tablet holds the writings of the long-dead dwarf Urheld Darkstone. An alchemist of great skill, he was thought insane by his contemporaries and, hence, did not share his research. But he did etch it onto tablets, and I believe one such tablet lies in Blackrock Spire, in a chamber once named the Hall of Fortune. I know not what it is now called, for few enter Blackrock and return. But if you are willing to brave its dangers and return to me with the tablet, your reward will be great.Vivian Lagrave and the Darkstone Tablet^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Apothecary Zinge^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Vivian Lagrave and the Darkstone Tablet^^^Speak with Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave.^Vivian Lagrave sent me word from Kargath, in the Badlands. Through her studies, she believes there is an ancient text within Blackrock Spire that would benefit our research. To confirm this, she will need someone to extract the text from the spire. No easy task. If interested, then speak with Vivian in Kargath.Homeward Bound^29^Horde^Thousand Needles^Pao'ka Swiftmountain^Motega Firemane^^^^Escort Pao'ka Swiftmountain from Highperch, and then talk to Motega Firemane in Whitereach Post.^Please help me, <class>! I've been hiding here in Highperch for some time now and it's been days since I've seen a friendly face. I came here to study the wyvern and I think I got a little too close. After being chased away from one of the nests I got lost. I need to get back to Whitereach Post! Motega does not know that I am missing and will be furious to know that I ventured into Highperch by myself. Whitereach Post is just east of here... please take me there!Dawn's Gambit^60^All^Scholomance^Betina Bigglezink^Betina Bigglezink^Leonid Barthalomew^^^Place Dawn's Gambit in the Viewing Room of the Scholomance. Defeat Vectus, then return to Betina Bigglezink.^I've placed Dawn's Gambit in the container you brought to us, the one that held the dragon eggs. Your job is to bring it deep within the Scholomance. The undead mage Vectus leads a team of Scourge scholars... place Dawn's Gambit in their chamber, called the "viewing room." It will then react with the undead found there and, with a little luck, destroy them! After that, defeating Vectus shouldn't be a problem. Right?Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe^34^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Xizk Goodstitch^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Bring a Gold Bar to Xizk Goodstitch in Stranglethorn Vale.^Your next task is as simple as your first, but will require you to seek out aid. I require gold thread for the embroidery of the cloak, but gold thread is not easy to come by, and very few know how to make it. Fortunately, one who is loyal to our cause knows its secrets and is willing to help those rising in our ranks. Bring a gold bar to Xizk Goodstitch in Booty Bay. He is a master tailor and will be happy to spin the thread for you. Gold bars are smelted by skilled miners. Ask a miner for help.Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe^34^All^Warlock^Xizk Goodstitch^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Return to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Return to Menara, tell her it'll take some time, but I'll make sure to come through for her... and you. Tell her to have you finish gathering the rest of your components--I should have the thread done by then. You can return and pick it up then. Good luck, <name>. Oh, and say hello to Strahad for me while you're there. That old coot... putting a tower right there next to Ratchet... crazy.Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe^37^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^Fine Gold Thread^Bring 10 Vials of Hatefury Blood and 1 Lesser Infernal Stone to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^The next components are found in Desolace, far to the west of the Barrens and even the Stonetalon Mountains. There, chaos still reigns after the Sundering. Both your strength and cunning will be tested there--you will face creatures of hatred and also of the Burning Legion. From the Hatefury satyr in the northeast, bring me their blood. From the lesser infernals in Mannoroc Coven, bring me a lesser infernal stone. We will use both in the construction of your robe.Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe^37^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Bring some Fine Gold Thread, 2 Smoldering Coals, and a Soul Shard to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^I need only three things now, <name>, then we can finish your robe. First, the fine gold thread Xizk is making for you. Return to him in Booty Bay and get it. Second, bring me two smoldering coals from the fire elementals in the Arathi Highlands. If I recall correctly, they are to the west, near Thoradin's Wall. Finally, a soul shard created by you. After you have all the components, return here to the tower and I will complete the robe for you.The Completed Robe^38^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Menara Voidrender^In Search of Menara Voidrender^^^Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete your robe and then speak to her again.^I will put the robe together for you now. It will take but a few moments. Do not go far.The Ancient Egg^50^All^The Hinterlands^Yeh'kinya^Yeh'kinya^Screecher Spirits^^^Bring the Ancient Egg to Yeh'kinya in Tanaris.^The Prophecy of Mosh'aru speaks of an ancient egg. It is a relic of a time when trolls ruled vast empires, and it has the power to hold the essence of Hakkar. It may be the only way to keep our world safe from his evil. Bring me the ancient egg, <name>. It is said to lay hidden deep within Jintha'Alor in the Hinterlands, in a cave behind the amphitheater at the top of the city.The Final Tablets^58^All^Blackrock Spire^Prospector Ironboot^Prospector Ironboot^The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru^^Confront Yeh'kinya^Bring the Fifth and Sixth Mosh'aru Tablets to Prospector Ironboot in Tanaris.^While I look over the third and fourth tablets of Mosh'aru, you must find the fifth and sixth! It will not be easy, for they are held by the Smolderthorn trolls within Blackrock Spire. The spire is a dark mountain of fire between the Burning Steppes and the Searing Gorge. Good luck, <name>. Blackrock Spire is no place for decent folk...Felnok Steelspring^54^All^Burning Steppes^Tinkee Steamboil^Felnok Steelspring^Broodling Essence^^^Give Tinkee's Letter to Felnok Steelspring at Everlook in Winterspring.^I have another favor to ask of you. My initial study of the essence you collected shows that it might be possible to freeze dragon whelp eggs and preserve them! I want to test this theory, but first I need specially made engineering components. My colleague, Felnok Steelspring, can make them. Here, take this letter to Felnok. It tells him what I need. You'll find Felnok in Winterspring, in the town of Everlook.Chillwind Horns^54^All^Winterspring^Felnok Steelspring^Felnok Steelspring^Broodling Essence^^^Collect 8 Uncracked Chillwind Horns.^I have most of what Tinkee needs, but I'm missing one important component, and that's chillwind horns. The horns of the chillwind chimaera in Winterspring are a concentrated source of cold, but only pristine, uncracked horns will do! I'll need a supply of those to complete Tinkee's order. Bring me the uncracked chillwind horns, and I'll prepare a package for Tinkee.Return to Tinkee^54^All^Winterspring^Felnok Steelspring^Tinkee Steamboil^Broodling Essence^^Tinkee Steamboil^Bring Felnok's Package to Tinkee Steamboil at Flame Crest in the Burning Steppes.^Ok, everything is prepared and packed and ready for transport! Good luck in your journey, and make sure you tell Tinkee that she owes me!The Red Crystal^14^Alliance^Darkshore^Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea^Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea^The Red Crystal^^^Travel east of Auberdine and look for a large, red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain range. Report back what you find to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine.^Hostile moonkin roam in ever increasing numbers to our east. They once were thought to be gentle, almost mystical creatures. While some continue to hold reverence for them, the safety of Auberdine forces me to keep a more realistic view. I've received reports that moonkin are being drawn to a large red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain range. No one has any idea what that crystal is, or even if it really exists. I want you to locate it over there and report back to me what you find.As Water Cascades^14^Alliance^Darkshore^Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea^Mysterious Red Crystal^The Red Crystal^^^Fill the Empty Water Tube at the Auberdine moonwell, and then investigate the red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain wall.^Use this empty vial and fill up on some moonwell water here in Auberdine. Such potent magic should provide a clue as to the composition of the crystal. To do that, you'll pour the liquid over the crystal; it should take care of the rest. While I don't anticipate anything bad happening to you, I still want you to be careful. Above us to the east is Felwood; if that crystal is tied to that place as I suspect it is, then it could prove to be very dangerous.The Fragments Within^14^All^Darkshore^Mysterious Red Crystal^Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea^The Red Crystal^^^Report back what you have found to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine.^The moonwell water has revealed that embedded inside the crystal are a few small fragments of bone, as well as half of a jawbone. The jawbone appears to be from a humanoid, but it is unclear without breaking open the crystal - a feat that even the strongest of magic would find near impossible. With the task at hand complete, all that remains is to report back to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine.Alien Egg^26^Horde^Thousand Needles^Hagar Lightninghoof^Hagar Lightninghoof^^^Serpent Wild^Return the Alien Egg to Hagar Lightninghoof in Freewind Post.^A rumor has surfaced about an alien egg here in Thousand Needles. Those that report seeing this egg have failed to even get close enough to examine it in detail. Serpents guard the egg as if it's one of their own. I want you to seek out this alien egg and bring it to me so that I may examine it. Reports say the egg is located within a serpent den, but there are several serpent dens along the base of the cliff walls south and northeast of Freewind Post.Pacify the Centaur^25^Horde^Thousand Needles^Cliffwatcher Longhorn^Cliffwatcher Longhorn^Message to Freewind Post^^^Kill 12 Galak Scouts, 10 Galak Wranglers, and 6 Galak Windchasers, and then return to Cliffwatcher Longhorn in Freewind Post.^<name>, I entreat you to hunt these centaur down. They shall feel the wrath of our revenge. Attack the centaur camp to the north of Freewind Post! Let wrath guide your hand!Strange Sources^56^All^Winterspring^Donova Snowden^Donova Snowden^Finding the Source^^^Follow Donova Snowden's instructions, then report back.^To tell you the truth, although there are no volcanoes here in Winterspring, I believe that there are far more threatening reasons for these hot springs... Well, I think you'll want to see it for yourself. You'll need to travel the length of Winterspring, and head to the very south. When the air becomes thick and muggy, and the sky turns dark, you'll have found what I believe to be the source of the hot springs. Have a look. I'm sure you'll have many questions when you return.Enraged Wildkin^59^Alliance^Winterspring^Jaron Stoneshaper^Damaged Crate^Enraged Wildkin^^^Locate Jaron Stoneshaper's wrecked camp and supplies in southern Winterspring.^Hey there, <lad/lass>! I was chased from my camp in southern Winterspring by some bloodthirsty wildkin! Well, I suppose I got too close to something the wildkin were guarding. I barely managed to get away safely; I fear a buddy of mine wasn't as lucky. Would you mind braving the wildkin and heading to the camp? I really need my supplies, and I'd also like to get back the amulet I unearthed yesterday at the dig site.En-Ay-Es-Tee-Why^59^All^Blackrock Spire^Kibler^Kibler^^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and collect 15 Spire Spider Eggs for Kibler.^Believe it or not, there are people out there willing to pay for the most vile of domesticated beast! I'd sent Bijou into the Spire to try and collect some of those spire spider eggs but I haven't heard from her in weeks. Maybe you can help me out? I'll tell you what, <name>. Go to Blackrock Spire and collect some spire spider eggs for me. Bring them back here and not only will I give you a little cash, but I'll even domesticate one for you!Enraged Wildkin^59^Alliance^Winterspring^Damaged Crate^Jaron's Wagon^Enraged Wildkin^^^Find Jaron Stoneshaper's wrecked wagon.^Looking around, you don't see much that Jaron could want here. However, you do notice that the crate you found has been smashed open, almost as if this was what the wildkin were after... Looking to the east, you can barely make out an abandoned wagon. Perhaps you might find Jaron's things there. It's worth a look.Enraged Wildkin^59^Alliance^Winterspring^Jaron's Wagon^Jaron Stoneshaper^Enraged Wildkin^^^Pick up Jaron's Supplies from the snow, then find the wildkin that stole the amulet Jaron spoke of.^After inspecting the contents of the box, you decide that Jaron could make use of the tools and other items inside. However, there is no sign of the amulet. It appears that the wildkin inhabit the lands to the north and east of here, so you decide that the next step is to face the creatures and reclaim the amulet from them.Serpent Wild^26^Horde^Thousand Needles^Hagar Lightninghoof^Motega Firemane^Serpent Wild^Alien Egg^^Report your findings to Motega Firemane at Whitereach Post in Thousand Needles.^If I did not see that with my own eyes I would never have believed it to be true. Vengeance has come to Thousand Needles! <Hagar wipes his brow.> <name>, you must act quickly! Go now and seek out Motega Firemane; he is located at Whitereach Post just northwest of Freewind Post along the road. He will know what to do!Mother's Milk^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Ragged John^Ragged John^^^^In the heart of Blackrock Spire you will find Mother Smolderweb. Engage her and get her to poison you. Chances are good that you will have to kill her as well. Return to Ragged John when you are poisoned so that he can 'milk' you.^It's probably one of the most potent poisons in the world, <race>! I've overheard the Blackrock speaking about its lethality in my jaunts into the Spire. They call it 'Mother's Milk', named after Mother Smolderweb, the big nasty spider in the Skitterweb cave. Now here's what I need from you: A live sample of the Milk, flowing through YOUR veins. Just bringing me the gland won't be enough! Get her to poison you and come back to me! Then... I get to milk ya! <Rubs his hands together in anticipation.>Urok Doomhowl^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Warosh^Warosh^^^^Read Warosh's Scroll. Bring Warosh's Mojo to Warosh.^Argh! So hard to speak! Take this note! Get me my mojo!Assassination Plot^28^Horde^Thousand Needles^Assassination Note^Kanati Greycloud^Assassination Plot^^^Warn Kanati Greycloud at Whitereach Post of the plot to kill him.^The Tauren, Kanati Greycloud is bold to set up a hunting camp in Thousand Needles. We must kill him to rid this hunting camp and all who may follow him. We will converge at the small post Southwest of the Great Lift.Guarding Secrets^59^Horde^Winterspring^Blue-feathered Necklace^Trull Failbane^Guarding Secrets^^^Take the Blue-feathered Necklace to Trull Failbane at Bloodvenom Post.^You are unsure of the significance of the necklace that fell from the neck of the recently-slain wildkin. It glows brightly, slowly fading in and out. Trull Failbane might be able to tell you more, since his knowledge of the wildkin seems extensive. Perhaps you should ask him about it.Guarding Secrets^59^Horde^Winterspring^Trull Failbane^Nara Wildmane^Guarding Secrets^^^Take the Blue-feathered Necklace to Nara Wildmane.^While I do possess much knowledge about the owlbeasts you defeated in Winterspring, I am not very learned on the subject of the magics they wield. But I do believe I know of one that would be able to examine the necklace and most likely tell you what it is. Nara Wildmane in Thunder Bluff is an expert in this field; see her. Good luck, <name>.Guardians of the Altar^59^Alliance^Winterspring^Ranshalla^Erelas Ambersky^^Find Ranshalla^Wildkin of Elune^Protect Ranshalla while she attempts to reactivate the Altar of Elune. Report your findings to Erelas Ambersky in Rut'theran Village.^At the very top of the ridge lies what I believe to be an altar of the goddess Elune. From what I can tell, we need to light the five torches in each cave, and then we will be able to access the altar directly. I transcribed some incantations carved into the stone in the ancient ruins of Kel'Theril, which I believe are the secret to unlocking the altar. I'll need your help to light each torch, while I recite the spell. If we are successful, you'll be able to report our findings to Erelas!Wildkin of Elune^57^Alliance^Winterspring^Erelas Ambersky^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^^Guardians of the Altar^^Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.^That's fascinating! I have always wondered about the truth... Well, you must share this knowledge, definitely! Go to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm right away -- you'll find him in Darnassus, in the Cenarion Circle. Explain to him what happened, just the same as you told me. I'm sure he will be just as interested! This is important information, <name>!Warlord's Command^60^Horde^Blackrock Spire^Warlord Goretooth^Warlord Goretooth^Warlord's Command^^^Slay Highlord Omokk, War Master Voone, and Overlord Wyrmthalak. Recover Important Blackrock Documents. Return to Warlord Goretooth in Kargath when the mission has been accomplished.^By order of Warlord Goretooth, the following inhabitants of Blackrock Spire must be destroyed: The rotund menace, Highlord Omokk. The cruel and ruthless troll, War Master Voone. Overlord Wyrmthalak, taskmaster of the lesser city. You will also be required to return any important documents that you may find. Succeed and be honored. Fail and be forgotten.Free at Last^29^Horde^Thousand Needles^Lakota Windsong^Thalia Amberhide^^^^Escort Lakota Windsong from the Darkcloud Pinnacle, and then talk to Thalia Amberhide at Freewind Post.^Arnak thinks we're going to be married... but after I declined his offer he came back that night and kidnapped me. My brother tried to stop him, but Arnak was too strong. He... he slew my brother and then brought me here. My poor brother... <name>, could you escort me out of the Darkcloud Pinnacle? Please... I need to get back to Thalia! She must be worried sick about me.Further Corruption^54^Alliance^Felwood^Eridan Bluewind^Eridan Bluewind^^The Corruption of the Jadefire^^Eridan Bluewind in Felwood wants you to kill 8 Jadefire Hellcallers, 8 Jadefire Betrayers, 8 Jadefire Tricksters, and Xavaric. Return to Eridan when the task is completed.^A second encampment of satyrs threatens the land of Felwood towards the north, led by the cruel Xavaric. The vile betrayers and tricksters feed upon the corruption of the native creatures of Felwood. Xavathras and his minions were only part of a larger plan -- to cultivate a corrupted moonwell, and then provide the spoils to Xavaric. Now that Xavathras is out of the way, finish this task, <name>. Head to the north and defeat Xavaric.Tinkee Steamboil^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Felnok Steelspring^Tinkee Steamboil^Tinkee Steamboil^Return to Tinkee^^Speak with Tinkee Steamboil at Flame Crest in the Burning Steppes.^Hi, <name>. Remember Tinkee Steamboil? Well, she remembers you! She sent me a message to keep an eye out for you, because... she needs your help again. I think it has something to do with her studies on dragons. You should speak to her in the Burning Steppes, at the Flame Crest.Lost in Battle^20^Horde^The Barrens^Mankrik^Mankrik^^^^Find Mankrik's wife and then return to him in the Crossroads.^We battled in a small tauren camp when we were separated--she held three of the Bristlebacks off by herself. But the odds began to overwhelm us. I led some away only to see her overwhelmed by newcomers. In my rage, I turned to face my enemies, but they brought me down easily with their vast numbers. I awoke to a tauren druid tending my wounds--he had come across me on the Gold Road as I fell. Please, <class>, find some sign of my wife.Eitrigg's Wisdom^60^Horde^Orgrimmar^Warlord Goretooth^Thrall^Warlord's Command^^^Speak with Eitrigg in Orgrimmar. When you have discussed matters with Eitrigg, seek council from Thrall.^Rend lives? Impossible! It had been thought that Rend was slain decades ago. Seek out the wisdom of Eitrigg, <name>. None know the workings of the Blackrock better than he and if what is written here bares truth, Eitrigg should be informed. No person should be denied the right of vengeance. You will find him in Orgrimmar. Once you have spoken with Eitrigg, confer with the Warchief to find out what he wishes to do about this problem.Cleansing of the Orb of Orahil^40^All^Warlock^Tabetha^Tabetha^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^^Kill the Demon of the Orb, then speak with Tabetha.^Ah, a summoner's orb--this is where the taint must be coming from. We must exorcise the demon within it if you're to use it. That I can do easily. You're the one who has the hard job. You must kill the demon once I release it. And you'll have to be quick. If you take too long then he'll return to the orb and we'll have to start over! So get yourself ready, <name>. Prepare your strongest spells and keep your potions handy, and go get a friend if you have one. Because this isn't going to be pretty.Shard of a Felhound^40^All^Warlock^Acolyte Wytula^Menara Voidrender^^^^Take the Felhas Ruby and use it on one of the Felhounds found in Desolace. After successful, bring the Felhas Ruby and the Imprisoned Felhound Spirit back to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^So, you have chosen to capture the soul of a felhound, good. Take this ruby--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you. I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the felhounds there. Those should do nicely. After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your ruby to Menara.Shard of an Infernal^40^All^Warlock^Acolyte Magaz^Menara Voidrender^^^^Take the Infus Emerald and use it on one of the Infernals found in Desolace. After successful, bring the Infus Emerald and the Imprisoned Infernal Spirit back to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^So, you have chosen to capture the soul of an infernal, good. Take this emerald--with it, you will be able to capture the creature's soul. It works very similar to spells you already know: when the creature is close to dying, use the gem and it should do the rest of the work for you. I would suggest going to Desolace and trying your hand at any of the infernals there. Those should do nicely. After you're successful, take both the captured spirit and your emerald to Menara.The Completed Orb of Dar'Orahil^40^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Menara Voidrender^^Returning the Cleansed Orb^^Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete the Orb of Dar'Orahil and then speak to her again.^I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon... I see no reason not to continue that practice.Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^35^Alliance^Warlock^Briarthorn^Menara Voidrender^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Well, well, well... a pleasure to see you're growing in power, <name>. I'd wager you'd be about ready to speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens. If you haven't spoken to her before, then let me tell you, I don't think I've ever met another expert in the creation of items--orbs specifically--that can inprison even a demon to serve our will so easily. If you're interested, she's in Strahad's tower above Ratchet in the Barrens.Protect Kanati Greycloud^28^Horde^Thousand Needles^Kanati Greycloud^Kanati Greycloud^Assassination Plot^^^Protect Kanati Greycloud from the centaur attack.^But, there may be more centaur than I thought, I ask you, <name>, to fight with me against these vile assassins.Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^35^Alliance^Warlock^Zevrost^Menara Voidrender^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Still a fool, and still seeking the trappings of mortals. Yes, I speak to you with arrogance. I see you before me and I laugh. You're pathetic! But it matters not what I think. It only matters what those willing to deal with you thinks! And in this case, against my better judgment, those with some portion of power feel you deserve more. If this is something you strive for then you should speak with Menara Voidrender in the tower above Ratchet. I believe you have met her before some time ago.Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^35^All^Warlock^Demisette Cloyce^Menara Voidrender^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Hmm, you've made it this far... truly astonishing. I would have thought the corruption of channeling the arcane would have seeped into your very soul and driven you mad by now. How about we try and push you further then? If you want to test your skill, seek out Menara Voidrender above Ratchet in Strahad's tower. She will guide you.Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^35^Horde^Warlock^Kaal Soulreaper^Menara Voidrender^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^^Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Haha! You're doing very well for yourself, young <class>. Given time, infernals and dreadlords will bow before you! But until that time comes, you must still rely on weapons forged by the hands of the mortal races. You seem prepared for another such creation, and if you are willing, Menara Voidrender would speak with you! She is near Strahad's tower overlooking the port town of Ratchet. Go there when you are ready.Frostsaber Provisions^60^Alliance^Winterspring^Rivern Frostwind^Rivern Frostwind^^^^Collect 5 Shardtooth Meats and 5 Chillwind Meats for Rivern Frostwind in Winterspring.^If you wish to prove yourself, you may begin by doing a very simple, but very important task. Gather meat from the chimaera and from the shardtooth bears in the area. Bring it to me so that I may use it to feed the frostsabers that are being trained.A Matter of Time^56^All^Western Plaguelands^Chromie^Chromie^^^Counting Out Time^Use the Temporal Displacer near one of Andorhal's silos and uncover Temporal Parasites.^Tampering of the timeline by a sinister force - most likely the Scourge - has occurred in Andorhal! I can try to keep the passage of time here intact and mend what has been damaged, but I'll need your help to do so uninterrupted. Temporal parasites - carrion that feed on the strands of time's altered flow - now infest the silos of Andorhal. A blue pulse of distortion is their only visual marker. They slow my auguries; please <name>, help me by using this temporal displacer to root out these parasites.Counting Out Time^56^All^Western Plaguelands^Chromie^Chromie^^A Matter of Time^Counting Out Time^Locate 5 Andorhal Watches, found in lockboxes amongst the rubble of the city. Return with them to Chromie in the Andorhal Inn, Western Plaguelands.^I need you to reach into the world beyond this room, <name>. Allow me to explain. You see the difference in this room compared to the rest of Andorhal. My dragonflight works in many different ways and in many different timelines. To mend Andorhal's damage, I now act from a different timeline as not to overly contaminate it. To continue this though I need time trinkets, ones trapped from when the plague hit. Find them in lockboxes found in the ruined buildings that make up this once proud city.Counting Out Time^56^All^Western Plaguelands^Chromie^Chromie^^Counting Out Time^^Locate 5 Andorhal Watches amongst the rubble of the city, and return with them to Chromie in the Andorhal Inn, Western Plaguelands.^If you are willing to help once more, I can certainly use your assistance. I'll gladly take more watches you might uncover from the ruins of Andorhal. They certainly help me in maintaining a balance against whatever malign force is meddling with the timeline here. In exchange for those watches, I'll give you another item that, in the future, I suspect you'll find quite the use for.For The Horde!^60^Horde^Blackrock Spire^Thrall^Thrall^Warlord's Command^^What the Wind Carries^Travel to Blackrock Spire and slay Warchief Rend Blackhand. Take his head and return to Orgrimmar.^Rend dares make such grand claims because of the protection he is afforded by the black flight. You, <name>, will find a way to pass through the Halls of Ascension. You will then find 'Warchief' Rend Blackhand and you will destroy him - FOR THE HORDE! <Thrall slams a fist down upon his throne.> The next time you return to my chambers, you will hold his head high in triumph and then you shall present it to your Warchief. Do this and be honored as a hero of the Horde.The Completed Orb of Noh'Orahil^40^All^Warlock^Menara Voidrender^Menara Voidrender^^Returning the Cleansed Orb^^Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete the Orb of Noh'Orahil and then speak to her again.^I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon... I see no reason not to continue that practice.Returning the Cleansed Orb^40^All^Warlock^Tabetha^Menara Voidrender^Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil^^The Completed Orb of Dar'Orahil, The Completed Orb of Noh'Orahil^Return the Cleansed Infernal Orb to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.^Take the cleansed orb back to Menara in Ratchet, <name>. Give her my regards and be safe. I truly hope you are able to withstand the temptation and corruption that is sure to come as you follow your path. Good luck.Operative Bijou^59^All^Blackrock Spire^Lexlort^Bijou^Operative Bijou^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and find out what happened to Bijou.^Never trust a goblin. That's what it comes down to, <name>. Bijou is her name - one of our slipperiest operatives. I found out she was working for some shady exotic pet dealer out of the Burning Steppes named Kibler, in essence, two timing us. Worse yet, she was using Horde funds to finance her operations. I want her brought back here alive. She was last seen entering Blackrock Spire. Find her and bring her back. And <name>, do not let her sweet talk you.Bijou's Belongings^59^Horde^Blackrock Spire^Bijou^Bijou^Operative Bijou^^^Find Bijou's Belongings and return them to her. You recall her mentioning that she stashed them on the bottom floor of the city.^At night when this place is lightly guarded, I sneak around the city, taking notes and writing down anything I see that could be of some strategic value to the K.E.F. Last night, however, things went dreadfully wrong. I stumbled across a tripwire and set off an alarm. I stashed my recon gear and ran for cover! Unfortunately, I can't get back to that gear. They've doubled and tripled up the patrols! All that information is lost. Get my belongings back and I'll return to the K.E.F. peacefully.Bijou's Reconnaissance Report^59^All^Blackrock Spire^Bijou^Lexlort^Operative Bijou^^^Take Bijou's Reconnaissance Report back to Grandmaster Lexlort in Kargath.^Take this report back to Lexlort. It will redeem my good name and will surely give the K.E.F. a strategic advantage in dealing with these orcs. Come with you? I've got way too much work to do. Get going, they need these reports as soon as possible!The Wildlife Suffers Too^54^All^Western Plaguelands^Mulgris Deepriver^Mulgris Deepriver^The Wildlife Suffers Too^^^Destroy 8 Diseased Wolves, and then return to Mulgris Deepriver at the Writhing Haunt, Western Plaguelands.^While there was little I could do alone to thwart the Scourge, I nevertheless came to these lands to try and heal the damage done to nature. Animals suffer from the plague that continues to choke these lands, unable to find mercy and peace. I ask for you to continue what I could not finish here. There is no salvation for the suffering animals but a sweet and merciful release. Seek out diseased wolves nearby and put them down. Please <name>, end their misery - doing so will surely soothe mine.The Wildlife Suffers Too^56^All^Western Plaguelands^Mulgris Deepriver^Mulgris Deepriver^The Wildlife Suffers Too^^Glyphed Oaken Branch, Glyphed Oaken Branch^Destroy 8 Diseased Grizzlies, and then return to Mulgris Deepriver at the Writhing Haunt, Western Plaguelands.^To the east of where we are, near where the Eastern Plaguelands begin, once proud and majestic grizzlies roamed the countryside. The plague released by the Scourge has sundered these beasts too. They wander the countryside, agonized by the stiffening of their muscles and the rotting of their fur and flesh. I ask of you to end their misery as well. The only cure for their suffering is a swift death, one that must be ministered by your hand.Glyphed Oaken Branch^56^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Mulgris Deepriver^Mathrengyl Bearwalker^^The Wildlife Suffers Too^^Based on the magic enchanted within the Glyphed Oaken Branch, its delivery to the Cenarion Circle in Darnassus is the next step the tauren druid sought. Seek one of the druids there for assistance.^The lifeless hand of the tauren druid clutches a surprisingly healthy looking oaken branch. Examining the branch reveals glyphs of a druidic nature carved into the bark. As you grasp the branch, you notice it is warm to the touch, more than it should be. The image of the Teldrassil tree enters your mind - Darnassus specifically - and the words "Cenarion Circle" are on the tip of your tongue. It would appear that the suggestion of where to take the branch has been placed within it.Glyphed Oaken Branch^56^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Mulgris Deepriver^Nara Wildmane^^The Wildlife Suffers Too^^Based on the magic enchanted within the Glyphed Oaken Branch, its delivery to the Cenarion Circle in Thunder Bluff is the next step the tauren druid sought. Seek one of the druids there for assistance.^The lifeless hand of the tauren druid clutches a surprisingly healthy looking oaken branch. Examining the branch reveals glyphs of a druidic nature carved into the bark. As you grasp the branch, you notice it is warm to the touch, more than it should be. The image of Thunder Bluff in Mulgore enters your mind - Elder Rise specifically - and the words "Cenarion Circle" are on the tip of your tongue. It would appear that the suggestion of where to take the branch has been placed within it.Bijou's Belongings^59^Alliance^Blackrock Spire^Bijou^Bijou^Bijou's Belongings^^^Find Bijou's Belongings and return them to her. Good luck!^Ordinarily I don't deal with <race>s but it seems that I'm stuck between a troll and a hard place. You see, my mission here is one of utmost importance to the Horde. The information I've discovered, however, applies to the well being of the Alliance as well. Now believe me, I'm no Alliance sympathizer, but the Blackrock threat is bigger than just a bunch of orcs. You help me out by finding my belongings and I'll help you out with some information that could prove useful to your kind. Deal?Message to Maxwell^59^All^Blackrock Spire^Bijou^Marshal Maxwell^Bijou's Belongings^^^Travel to the Burning Steppes and give Bijou's Information to Marshal Maxwell.^I'm a goblin of my word, <race>. Now listen closely: These orcs are used primarily as beasts of burden and cannon fodder for the black dragonflight! Their true leader is none other than Nefarian, brood of Deathwing. I've also discovered the location of Nefarian's subordinates in this part of the citadel. Take this map to Marshal Maxwell in the Burning Steppes. It has the location of these fiends marked for easy identification.Better Late Than Never^52^All^Western Plaguelands^Janice Felstone^Janice's Parcel^^^Better Late Than Never, Better Late Than Never^The ramblings of the ghostly woman indicated that she needed a package delivered. She claimed that it was where her horse was. As to where the horse is or where the package was to be delivered - the ghost remains incomprehensible.^"The package must be delivered... delivered before I'm trapped here!" The cries of a panicked woman feel almost like a whisper floating through the house. Cowered in the upstairs corner is the apparition of a woman. She does not seem to be fully cognizant of her surroundings, and she is only vaguely aware of you. "Are you here to deliver my package? Please, before it gets much worse! I was going to ride out of here. It should still be by my horse... or am I too late?"Better Late Than Never^52^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Janice's Parcel^Royal Factor Bathrilor^Better Late Than Never^Better Late Than Never^^Check with the Royal Factors of Stormwind to learn the whereabouts of an Emma Felstone. There is usually a census officer located in City Hall.^You pick up the package, wiping off a small layer of dust and grime that had settled on it. It is addressed in a hurried hand to an Emma Felstone of Stormwind; the delivery of the package is dated for well over four years ago. Though it is unclear if Emma Felstone is even alive, it is widely known that the Stormwind City Hall keep records on the populace of the city. This is handled through the Royal Factors of the Stormwind Census.Better Late Than Never^52^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Janice's Parcel^Royal Overseer Bauhaus^Better Late Than Never^Better Late Than Never^^Check with the Royal Overseers of the Undercity to learn the whereabouts of a Jeremiah Felstone. There is usually a census officer located near guild and tabard registration.^You pick up the package, wiping off a small layer of dust and grime that had settled on it. It is addressed in a hurried hand to a Jeremiah Felstone of Lordaeron; the delivery of the package is dated for well over four years ago. Though it is unclear if Jeremiah Felstone is even alive, it is widely known that the Undercity, formerly known as Lordaeron, keeps records on the populace of the city. This is handled through the Royal Overseers of the Undercity Census.Supplies for the Crossroads^14^Horde^The Barrens^Thork^Thork^^Disrupt the Attacks^^Find and return Crossroads' Supply Crates to Thork in the Barrens.^That attack on the caravan contained supplies we desperately needed. You've been brave enough to take on the Razormane tribe so far, and I will ask you to do so again, but this time, I wonder if I could ask you to keep your eyes open for some of our lost supplies. You can probably find them throughout their camps, the quilboar getting fat off their dishonorable acts. The people of the Crossroads would be in your debt.Finkle Einhorn, At Your Service!^60^All^Blackrock Spire^Finkle Einhorn^Malyfous Darkhammer^^^Cap of the Scarlet Savant, Leggings of Arcana, Breastplate of Bloodthirst^Talk to Malyfous Darkhammer in Everlook.^You'll find Malyfous Darkhammer in Everlook, <class>. Tell him that 'Finkle is A-OK' and that the suit works perfectly. Then hand him this: <Finkle hands you a glowing piece of flesh.> I snatched it from the beast's innards during my 'vacation.' I bet Malyfous could give you a fairly accurate assessment of what he can do with parts from a monster like this! Oh, I suppose you don't know where Everlook is, do you? To Winterspring, <fella/lady>!Good Natured Emma^52^Alliance^Stormwind City^Royal Factor Bathrilor^Ol' Emma^Better Late Than Never^^Good Luck Charm^Find Ol' Emma in Stormwind and see if she is in fact Emma Felstone. If she is, then perhaps she'd like the package Janice Felstone made for her.^She's a tad ornery, and quite possibly out of her gourd... but the records indicate that Ol' Emma does fit the framework of who Emma Felstone might be. Perhaps you've seen Ol' Emma wander the city - she talks to herself, most often in nonsensical jibber-jabber. Still, she doesn't hurt anything or anyone, so folks pretty much leave her be. All things considered, I would say that Ol' Emma is in fact Emma Felstone. You might try asking if her last name is indeed Felstone.The Jeremiah Blues^52^Horde^Undercity^Royal Overseer Bauhaus^Jeremiah Payson^Better Late Than Never^^Good Luck Charm^Find Jeremiah Payson in the Undercity and see if he is in fact Jeremiah Felstone. If he is, then perhaps he'd like the package Janice Felstone made for him.^From the evidence I am able to muster, the person you seek - and the intended recipient of the parcel - is Jeremiah Payson, the Undercity cockroach vendor. I've always been of the opinion that it takes a special gift to sell... cockroaches. No doubt you are on quite the epic sojourn now, mighty <class>. I will leave you to your world-shaping endeavors. Allow me, however, to be a part of your magnum opus and reveal that he is located near the bank, suitably groveling under one of the walkways.Good Luck Charm^52^All^Western Plaguelands^Ol' Emma^Janice Felstone^Better Late Than Never^^^Return to Janice Felstone in Western Plaguelands her Good Luck Half-Charm.^It would seem that I was wrong about you <name>, and for that I owe you an apology. My sister sent me a number of personal effects, including humorously enough the deed to the Felstone farm. I think I'll pass on reclaiming it right now. If my sister's spirit remains tethered to the farm and cannot rest, please... could you return this to her? It is half of a good luck charm she had, with her husband having the other half. Maybe her knowing I have these things will now put her soul to rest.Two Halves Become One^54^All^Western Plaguelands^Janice Felstone^Janice Felstone^Better Late Than Never^^^Locate the other half of the Good Luck Charm somewhere on the Felstone Farm in Western Plaguelands and reassemble it.^The ramblings of the poor ghost continue: "I'm so cold, John. Bring me your charm, and we'll be together! Quickly John, before the plague comes to change us into hideous beasts! I can't see you John... but I know you're near. I feel you near me." Perhaps if the second half of the charm was found and reassembled, this would constitute what the spirit of Janice Felstone is seeking.Blood Shards of Agamaggan^21^Horde^The Barrens^Mangletooth^Mangletooth^^Tribes at War^Betrayal from Within, Spirit of the Wind, Agamaggan's Strength, Agamaggan's Agility, Wisdom of Agamaggan, Rising Spirit, Razorhide^Bring a Blood Shard to Mangletooth in Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.^Along with the thorns, the blood affected other aspects of the earth: blood red stones mixed in with other minerals. The Bristleback dig up these shards and carry them as totems for strength in battle and as totems for their magics. I know the secrets of that magic. Bring Mangletooth one of these blood shards to show you understand. Bring Mangletooth many of the shards, and he will bless you with quilboar magic--the magic of Agamaggan!Ursius of the Shardtooth^56^All^Winterspring^Storm Shadowhoof^Storm Shadowhoof^Ursius of the Shardtooth^^^Storm Shadowhoof at Everlook in Winterspring wants you to kill Ursius.^In the snowy mountains of Winterspring, to the northwest, a skilled hunter stalks his prey... I speak of Ursius of the shardtooth bears, an agile and clever beast. I send you now against him. He roams the sloping hills to the northwest of Everlook. Find and hunt him, before he discovers your intent. All that have gone up against Ursius have quickly found themselves to be the prey, and he, the hunter. Stay on your guard.Brumeran of the Chillwind^58^All^Winterspring^Storm Shadowhoof^Storm Shadowhoof^Ursius of the Shardtooth^^^Storm Shadowhoof at Everlook in Winterspring wants you to kill Brumeran.^Swift, and clever, Brumeran glides silently across the snowy landscape of southern Winterspring. But do not let her graceful appearance convince you that she is harmless. All that cross her pay considerably, and often with their own lives. Seek out Brumeran of the chillwind among the chimera. Defeat her, then return again to me.Shy-Rotam^60^All^Winterspring^Storm Shadowhoof^Storm Shadowhoof^Ursius of the Shardtooth^^Past Endeavors^Storm Shadowhoof at Everlook in Winterspring wants you to defeat Shy-Rotam.^In northern Winterspring, great cats assemble around a large landmark called Frostsaber Rock. The leader of these cats is known by the name Shy-Rotam. Defeating the matriarch of the frostsabers would grant you much respect in the eyes of your fellow <race>. Go again to the harsh wilds, and once there, gather sacred meat from the frostsabers. Find the stone of Shy-Rotam, and place it there. Placing the meat of her kin before her will summon Shy-Rotam, in anger. Be ready for her fury, and defeat her.Past Endeavors^60^All^Winterspring^Storm Shadowhoof^Storm Shadowhoof^^Shy-Rotam^^Bring Storm Shadowhoof's Marker to Melor Stonehoof in Thunder Bluff.^Before you spoke to me, <name>, I had heard of your endeavors... that you had an unyielding desire to prove yourself, that you had an exceptional ability as a <class>, and I now know these things to be the truth. Those that excel as you do are worthy of recognition. Take this marker to a friend of mine in Thunder Bluff named Melor Stonehoof. I'm sure he will remember you, and what you accomplished so long ago. Speak to him of you recent victories, and do not ever forget what you have accomplished today.Aquatic Form^16^Night Elf^Druid^Dendrite Starblaze^Mathrengyl Bearwalker^A Lesson to Learn^^^Return to Darnassus and show Mathrengyl Bearwalker the Pendant of the Sea Lion.^You have completed the necessary lessons all young druids are taught before they can adopt an aquatic aspect. Go now back to your trainer, Mathrengyl Bearwalker, in Darnassus. Show him your pendant and prove to him you are ready to learn what he has to teach you. He will complete your training, allowing you to become one with the water. Goodbye, young druid. We shall speak again.Sacred Fire^27^Horde^Thousand Needles^Motega Firemane^Magatha Grimtotem^Serpent Wild^^Arikara^Gather 10 bushels of Incendia Agave, and then consult Magatha Grimtotem on Elder Rise in Thunderbluff.^Arikara is a deadly creature that must be dealt with swiftly. In order to hunt her down you will need to light the sacred fire of life - this will summon Arikara. Go now and harvest the rare Incendia agave plant.

The Grimtotem Clan is up to something secretive. Three agents of unknown origin were seen visiting the Grimtotem over the recent weeks. We discovered that separate chests in Darkcloud Pinnacle hold these guarded messages. <name>, if you succeed in this dangerous mission, I will reward you in kind.The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru^58^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Prospector Ironboot^Prospector Ironboot^The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru^The God Hakkar^^Bring the Third and Fourth Mosh'aru Tablets to Prospector Ironboot in Tanaris.^The troll with whom you spoke did not tell the truth. The two tablets you gained for him spoke of containing the essence of Hakkar, but there is more to that legend. I have studied long, and found that there are six Tablets of Mosh'aru, not two! Six! And I fear that we will not like what secrets the others hold.. Find the third and fourth tablets of Mosh'aru. They're in the Eastern Plaguelands, held by the mossflayer trolls. Find them, and bring them to me.A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^50^Alliance^Stormwind City^Crier Goodman^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^^^Seek out Commander Ashlam Valorfist.

BEHOLD!Maxwell's Mission^60^Alliance^Blackrock Spire^Marshal Maxwell^Marshal Maxwell^Bijou's Belongings^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and destroy War Master Voone, Highlord Omokk, and Overlord Wyrmthalak.^This information fills in the gaps to our otherwise impeccable intelligence of Blackrock Spire. The attack must be decisive, <name>. First their war master, the troll Voone, must be destroyed. Without his battle plans, the Blackrock orcs will be thrown into chaos. You must then take out the ogre Highlord, Omokk. The cowardly ogres of Blackrock are powerless without his leadership. Lastly, the overlord of the citadel: Wyrmthalak. With Wyrmthalak dead, their central command unit is without a conduit.Threat of the Winterfall^56^All^Winterspring^Donova Snowden^Donova Snowden^Trouble in Winterspring!^^^Donova Snowden in Winterspring wants you to kill 8 Winterfall Pathfinders, 8 Winterfall Den Watchers, and 8 Winterfall Totemics.^I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have ...strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg. They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here. I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?Winterfall Firewater^56^All^Winterspring^Empty Firewater Flask^Donova Snowden^Winterfall Firewater^^^Bring the Empty Firewater Flask to Donova Snowden in Winterspring.^This vial that you picked up from the Winterfall furbolg is empty, but you can detect a few drops of a strange green liquid inside; it almost glows. Is it something important? Donova Snowden would probably be able to tell you more, since she has been camped by the hot springs in Winterspring for some time now.Falling to Corruption^56^All^Winterspring^Donova Snowden^Deadwood Cauldron^Winterfall Firewater^^^Search the Deadwood furbolg camp in northern Felwood for a clue.^This greenish liquid... it reminds me a bit of the sludge I saw when traveling through Felwood. And I have seen some Winterfall Runners passing into Timbermaw... Perhaps these things have something to do with the flask you found, <name>. There is a large group of furbolg just past Timbermaw Hold, in Felwood. Called the Deadwood tribe, they have been corrupted and driven mad by the fel. Why don't you look around there and see if you can find any evidence of dealings between the Winterfall and the Deadwood?Mystery Goo^56^All^Winterspring^Deadwood Cauldron^Donova Snowden^Winterfall Firewater^^^Report back to Donova Snowden with your findings.^The greenish substance inside the cauldron appears to be similar to what you found in the flask. This strange gooey stuff could be as corrupted as the furbolg that created it... If the Winterfall furbolg are using it, does this mean that they will soon be as corrupted as the Deadwood tribe? It would be best to report back to Donova with your findings, along with a sample of the liquid in the cauldron.Toxic Horrors^56^All^Winterspring^Donova Snowden^Donova Snowden^Winterfall Firewater^^^Collect 3 Toxic Horror Droplets for Donova Snowden in Winterspring.^I've studied the sample you returned with, and while I can't say for sure, I believe it contains traces of toxic elements. However, the only way to know for sure is to gather some as a comparison. I believe that the Deadwood furbolg may be gathering these elements from other corrupted creatures in Felwood; in particular, the elementals living in the Irontree Woods, called toxic horrors. Collect a few samples for me to compare, but be careful -- it's very dangerous there!Winterfall Runners^57^All^Winterspring^Donova Snowden^Donova Snowden^Winterfall Firewater^^The Final Piece^Find the Winterfall Runners and stop them from delivering their shipment to Winterfall Village.^Very interesting, <name>... When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater. We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment.Arikara^28^Horde^Thousand Needles^Magatha Grimtotem^Motega Firemane^^Sacred Fire^^Slay Arikara. Bring her remains and the Incendia powder to Motega Firemane in Whitereach Post as proof of your deed.^Take this refined and purified Incendia powder to Thousand Needles and toss it on the sacred fire of life. It is located in the Darkcloud Pinnacle on an isolated needle where they bury their dead. The enchantment that I have weaved into the Incendia powder will summon Arikara to you, <name>. I fear she may be stalking Cairne Bloodhoof; too much Tauren lore has changed, and I fear this has angered Arikara. Move quickly before all is lost, <class>!General Drakkisath's Command^60^Alliance^Blackrock Spire^General Drakkisath's Command^Marshal Maxwell^General Drakkisath's Command^^^Take General Drakkisath's Command to Marshal Maxwell in Burning Steppes.^From the corpse of the defeated serpent you uncover what appears to be a note of some importance: A letter from his superior, General Drakkisath, concerning protocol. Your instinct tells you that you should take it to Marshal Maxwell.A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^50^Alliance^Ironforge^Courier Hammerfall^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^^^Seek out Commander Ashlam Valorfist.

The Scourge relies on the buffer of undead that infests Sorrow Hill as a first line of defense. If we are to advance on Andorhal, we will need to do it through Sorrow Hill. Your first assignment will be to clear the way through Sorrow Hill.

They've made camp between Felstone Field and Dalson's Tears, making us risk conflict against both the Scourge and the Crusade at once. My plan is to play them off of each other by sending you to destroy the command tent they've set up; use some Flame in a Bottle from this box of incendiaries. Once razed, plant this Scourge banner by the tent. With some luck, they'll ignore us and focus on the Scourge for vengeance.All Along the Watchtowers^56^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^^Clear the Way^Alas, Andorhal, Scholomance^Using the Beacon Torch, mark each tower in Andorhal; you will need to stand in the doorway of the tower to successfully mark it.^Through the use of a magical device known as a beacon torch, we can mark targets of our choosing for future actions by our troops. To that end, we think the Scourge are using Andorhal's watchtowers as a means to control their troop movements. Your mission: breach Andorhal's defenses to plant beacons at all four watchtowers. You'll need to be in the doorway of each tower to plant the beacon; it will then proceed to mark the tower. There are only five charges on the beacon torch, so use them wisely!All Along the Watchtowers^56^Horde^Western Plaguelands^High Executor Derrington^High Executor Derrington^^Scarlet Diversions^Alas, Andorhal, Scholomance^Using the Beacon Torch, mark each tower in Andorhal; you will need to stand in the doorway of the tower to successfully mark it.^Through the use of a magical device known as a beacon torch, we can mark targets of our choosing for future actions by our troops.

We must be vigilant, <name>. None should be spared our wrath as none of our own were spared when they struck at our homes and families. Find this General Drakkisath and destroy him! The task certainly will not be a simple one, but the rewards shall be extravagant.Hot Fiery Death^60^All^Blacksmithing^Human Remains^Malyfous Darkhammer^Hot Fiery Death^^^Someone in this world must know what to do with these gauntlets. Good luck!^The only thing that remains of this human are some charred bones. He seems to have died within arms reach of what he was after - unfired plate gauntlets. Perhaps you should grab the gauntlets and get out of the fire?High Chief Winterfall^59^All^Winterspring^Donova Snowden^Donova Snowden^Winterfall Firewater^^^Donova Snowden in Winterspring wants you to defeat High Chief Winterfall.^While we still know very little about why the furbolg have been ingesting this strange substance, I do think it's best that we put a stop to it before it gets out of hand. The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but I think that if their leader is slain, they will not get any worse. Head east to Winterfall Village.The Final Piece^59^All^Winterspring^Crudely-written Log^Donova Snowden^^Winterfall Runners^Words of the High Chief^Bring the Crudely-written Log to Donova Snowden in Winterspring.^The log you found on the high chief looks extensive, but after looking through a couple of the pages, you find that you cannot read the text.

A deal I shall make with you, however... take this pike, it is imbued with powerful Fel energies. When you find Goraluk Anvilcrack, slay him and drive this pike through his dying heart. His soul he bartered, his soul I shall have.

He is part of a group known as the Emerald Circle, druids that are committed to their work in Felwood, healing the land from the corruption. Kelek has much experience with the furbolgs in Felwood, and may be able to tell you more about the log.

My father's the bravest man in the whole world! But I've been here for a long time, and he hasn't come for me.

I must know that you are an enemy of the Shadow Council--the ones responsible for many evils here and abroad. Travel deeper into Felwood. To the west you will see a path leading to Jaedenar. It is there that the Council plots with the Burning Legion. Enter the depths of one of the corrupted Barrow Dens they inhabit and slay their kind. Return to me after you've done this. Then I will know you truly seek to help us.Verifying the Corruption^54^All^Felwood^Taronn Redfeather^Taronn Redfeather^^^^Seek out and destroy 2 Entropic Beasts and 2 Entropic Horrors while exploring Shatter Scar Vale. After checking to see if the craters there are still filled with corrupt fel water, return to Taronn Redfeather in Felwood.^To the north, along the east of the road in what's called Shatter Scar Vale, is an area where infernals were called down during the last great war--the craters still scar the land, as do the infernals themselves. I am curious about two things. First, are there still entropic elementals roaming the area? And second, are the craters still filled with the corrupt, fetid water that gathered there years ago? Will you help me and check, <name>? Be careful though, the infernals destroy anything in their path.Collection of the Corrupt Water^52^All^Felwood^Greta Mosshoof^Greta Mosshoof^Forces of Jaedenar^^^Take the Empty Canteen to the Moon Well in the center of Jaedenar and fill it before returning to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood.^Deep within Jaedenar lies Shadow Hold--the main fortress of their corruption and evil. The Shadow Council has protective spells surrounding their lair in the form of braziers. If I am to find out any more information about our enemy through scrying, then those braziers must be extinguished. By doing so, I should be able to spy on the Council and find out who leads them.

South of Ratchet, hidden along the shore, is an old friend of mine, a shaman named Islen Waterseer. She is a powerful shaman who will help us. Her relationship with the spirits of water has always been strong. Our task being a noble one should be enough to persuade her and the spirits of water to aid us in this task. You should find her at a small camp right along the water's edge. And, <name>, ignore the pirates... they are but a nuisance and no threat to you.Cleansed Water Returns to Felwood^54^All^Felwood^Islen Waterseer^Greta Mosshoof^Cleansed Water Returns to Felwood^Seeking Spiritual Aid^^Take the Purified Moon Well Water to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood.^Thank the spirits, <name>.

Give her Awbee's scale.^Travel to Kalimdor, <race>. Our flight makes its home in the frigid landscape of Winterspring. Once you reach Winterspring, find the caves of Mazthoril. Upon the icy floors of Mazthoril you will find cobalt runes. Hold one of my scales and stand upon a rune and you shall be transported to Haleh, our matron protectorate. Give her the scale so that she may scry what it is I have seen and felt, here in this doomed place.Wrath of the Blue Flight^60^All^Winterspring^Haleh^Haleh^The Matron Protectorate^^^Speak with Haleh if you wish to continue.^We understand what the cursed brood of Deathwing attempts to do and we know that it cannot be allowed. Because of the protection Blackrock mountain affords Nefarian, it has become increasingly difficult for us to intercede. We can, however, empower you, mortal - should you so choose. The path before you is one full of peril. You must decide whether to accept our help. Ponder this and speak with me again when a decision has been made.Wrath of the Blue Flight^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Haleh^Jeziba^The Matron Protectorate^^^Speak with Jeziba in the Plaguelands. He resides in Andorhal.^It is the arcane that I control and the arcane which will send you to your next destination. When you are ready, the journey will begin. To the Plaguelands you will go and to Jeziba you will speak. He is a mortal as wise as the ancients and as patient as the immovable earth. Find him in Andorhal.Are We There, Yeti?^58^All^Winterspring^Umi Rumplesnicker^Umi Rumplesnicker^Are We There, Yeti?^^A Yeti of Your Own^Take Umi's Mechanical Yeti and scare her friends with it:^It's all ready, <name>! Now, I sent some mail to my friends already, telling them that I have a surprise for them. This is where you come in! I'm going to give you my mechanical yeti, and you need to surprise them by paying each of my friends a visit, turning the yeti on and sending it towards them. Once you have shown Legacki in Everlook, Sprinkle in Gadgetzan, and Quixxil in Marshal's Refuge, come back and tell me what happened! Please bring my yeti back to me then, too.Catalogue of the Wayward^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Jeziba^Catalogue of the Wayward^The Matron Protectorate^^Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight, Legplates of the Chromatic Defier^Read from the Catalogue of the Wayward.^A finer instrument of justice, Haleh could not have chosen. Read from the catalogue of the wayward and be enlightened. Should you persist... should you do what is asked of you... should you survive... a hero you will make.Dousing the Flames of Protection^55^All^Felwood^Greta Mosshoof^Greta Mosshoof^Cleansed Water Returns to Felwood^^A Final Blow^Using the Purified Moon Well Water, douse the flames of the four braziers of protection within Shadow Hold in Felwood, then return to Greta Mosshoof in the Emerald Sanctuary.^Now, you must return to Jaedenar. The braziers are more than likely spread throughout Shadow Hold. Douse each of their flames and the protections the Council has set up will fall for at least a short period of time. I will be waiting for that to happen. When it does, I will look deep within the Hold and try to find out who the head of this beast is. Then, and only then, will we see about attacking them directly.Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Catalogue of the Wayward^Jeziba^^Catalogue of the Wayward^^To forge the Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight, you will be required to bring the following items to Jeziba the 'Sculptor':^The forging of a powerful breastplate to protect against the unrelenting attacks of the chromatic flight is one built upon irony. The scales of the very beasts we battle must be sewn to the pristine carapace of an elder chromatic drake or dragon. None are known to exist at this time and we should hope that none will ever exist. Lastly, perhaps the most difficult of all components: the blood of heroes. The Sculptor must ultimately forge this creation.Legplates of the Chromatic Defier^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Catalogue of the Wayward^Jeziba^^Catalogue of the Wayward^^To forge the Legplates of the Chromatic Defier, you will be required to bring the following items to Jeziba the 'Sculptor':^The carapace of a mature chromatic drake is needed to form the foundation of the leggings. Brilliant chromatic scales are then layered upon the wire frame and enchanted in the blood of heroes. Finally, the supple skin of shadow must be applied to the inner greaves.Heroes of Darrowshire^56^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Carlin Redpath^Carlin Redpath^^Brother Carlin^Marauders of Darrowshire^Bring Davil's Libram and Redpath's Shield to Carlin Redpath.^The heroes of Darrowshire hold a place in my heart, and the book you brought me, the Annals of Darrowshire, tells their tales. It tells of the paladin Davil Lightfire and how the Crusade took his libram to the town hall of Hearthglen. Its passages also speak of my brother, Captain Redpath. After his betrayal, his shield was cracked and discarded and now lies in the most unlikely of places -- near the barn of Gahrron's Withering. Gather these relics, <name>. For fate and tragedy surrounds them.Villains of Darrowshire^57^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Carlin Redpath^Carlin Redpath^Brother Carlin^^Marauders of Darrowshire^Bring the Skull of Horgus and the Shattered Sword of Marduk to Carlin Redpath at Light's Hope Chapel.^The Annals of Darrowshire tells of the villains of that battle. It tells how the ghoul lord Horgus the Ravager was destroyed by Alliance forces during the battle. His body was cast into a lake, northwest of Corin's Crossing, and his skull remains there. Marduk the Black was never defeated, but his fabled sword was shattered and lost. It lies at the bottom of the gorge west of Corin's Crossing. Retrieve these items, <name>. I know not why, but I am certain their fate lies with you.Winterfall Intrusion^60^Alliance^Winterspring^Rivern Frostwind^Rivern Frostwind^^^^Rivern Frostwind wants you to slay 5 Winterfall Shaman and 5 Winterfall Ursa.^My presence goes unnoticed by most, <name>. However, there is an annoyance that seems firmly rooted here in Winterspring: the Winterfall furbolg. Although I have never directly attacked the furbolg, they seem crazed, fearful of anything in their path. I have watched them slay countless creatures that had the misfortune to simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I am weary of their meddling -- please, help me by fighting back. Slay the furbolg and keep them away from Frostsaber Rock.A Strange Red Key^55^All^Felwood^Blood Red Key^Captured Arko'narin^^^Rescue From Jaedenar^Search through Jaedenar to discover what the Blood Red Key is used for.^The small red key seems to be made of some kind of bone material. It is heavy in your hand, but appears very fragile. Why would a member of the Shadow Council have such a thing? Perhaps there is something within Jaedenar that this strange key unlocks.Rescue From Jaedenar^55^All^Felwood^Captured Arko'narin^Jessir Moonbow^Rescue From Jaedenar^A Strange Red Key^^Escort Arko'narin to where Lightforge and her equipment are being held, and then protect her as you escape Shadow Hold. Afterwards, seek out Jessir Moonbow in Felwood to let her know what's happened to her friends.^But, as much as it pains me, there is one thing that must be done first: I have to find Trey's sword Lightforge and escape Shadow Hold to tell my superiors what's happening here. Can you help me, <name>? Our equipment isn't far from here, and you've already proven you can survive the path to the top. After we escape, I'll head to Darnassus if you can find my friend Jessir near the Ashenvale border. She was to meet us at the Emerald Circle's camp near there. What do you say, <name>? Can you help me again?Retribution of the Light^57^All^Felwood^Jessir Moonbow^Remains of Trey Lightforge^Rescue From Jaedenar^^^Return to Jaedenar and kill the succubus Rakaiah before finding the Remains of Trey Lightforge.^She would like to pretend that she's fine. She'd love for me to think that she's strong enough to deal with all of this on her own, but I know better than that. Trey's death and hearing the torture he was put through is going to haunt her for a long time, and there's nothing we can do to stop that. But we can give her some peace! <name>, return to Shadow Hold, kill Trey's torturer and find his remains. There is no reason we can't tie off all these loose ends while Arko'narin mourns in her own private way.Marauders of Darrowshire^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Carlin Redpath^Carlin Redpath^Marauders of Darrowshire^Heroes of Darrowshire, Villains of Darrowshire^^Bring 5 Resonating Skulls and the Mystic Crystal to Carlin Redpath in Eastern Plaguelands.^Chromie said the relics you gathered are reagents to a powerful spell, and one more is required: skulls from the scourge who took part in the battle of Darrowshire. Take this crystal and hunt scourge champions for their skulls. The crystal is enchanted; if a champion took part in the battle, then when you pass the crystal over its skull it will resonate. Bring me those resonating skulls. Go, <name>. You'll find scourge champions in the Noxious Glade to the north and the Fungal Vale to the west.Brother Carlin^56^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Chromie^Carlin Redpath^Brother Carlin^The Annals of Darrowshire^Heroes of Darrowshire^Bring the Extended Annals of Darrowshire to Carlin Redpath in Eastern Plaguelands.^The Annals of Darrowshire, through my magic, has gained pages at its end, and now it extends its history beyond the battle. One of the extra passages tells of another Redpath, Carlin, who survived Joseph's betrayal. Carlin's now in the Plaguelands to the east, at the Light's Hope Chapel. Take the book and speak with him.Defenders of Darrowshire^55^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Carlin Redpath^Carlin Redpath^Uncle Carlin^^^Free 15 Darrowshire Spirits and return to Carlin Redpath.^Many of the defenders fell at the battle of Darrowshire. And many roam again as the ghastly servants of the Scourge! Find these poor souls and end their misery! Hunt cannibal ghouls, gibbering ghouls and diseased flayers. Many of these fiends were once the good folk of Darrowshire and destroying their forms now will set their souls free. You will find them in Plaguewood and Corin's Crossing, and in other Scourge strongholds of Eastern Plaguelands.The Flesh Does Not Lie^60^All^Stratholme^Betina Bigglezink^Betina Bigglezink^The Flesh Does Not Lie^^^Recover 10 Plagued Flesh Samples from Stratholme and return them to Betina Bigglezink. You suspect that any creature in Stratholme would have said flesh sample.^The Forsaken apothecaries are not the only beings in this world schooled in the sciences. I have been studying the plague for years, <race>. We had previously thought that the potency of the plague was dwindling, but what I have discovered here in the Plaguelands is startling. The plague seems to be growing in strength! I need to run more tests! The most potent source of the plague is from the tainted flesh of the most recently infected. Travel to Stratholme and bring me samples, <name>.The Active Agent^60^All^Stratholme^Betina Bigglezink^Betina Bigglezink^The Flesh Does Not Lie^^^Travel to Stratholme and search the ziggurats. Find and return new Scourge Data to Betina Bigglezink.^You will have to delve deeper into Stratholme, <name>. Beyond the first gates you will find the ziggurats. We know that the Scourge draws great power from these structures. Search the Ziggurats and return with any information that you may discover.The Great Fras Siabi^60^All^Stratholme^Smokey LaRue^Smokey LaRue^^^^Find Fras Siabi's smoke shop in Stratholme and recover a box of Siabi's Premium Tobacco. Return to Smokey LaRue when the job is done.^Terrible thing... what happened to Fras. You see, the town was sacked and Fras didn't want to leave his precious goods behind. The last thing I remember him saying was, 'I'll burn every last leaf before they get their damned, dirty hands on them!' I may love a good stogie but I'm no fool. I left Fras and his delightful store that day. I assume he went down in flames but if there's a chance that even one box of his famous tobacco is still intact... What do you say, <name>? Find a box for ol' Smokey?The Scourge Cauldrons^53^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^High Priestess MacDonnell^The Scourge Cauldrons^Clear the Way^^Speak with High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands.^Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four here in the west, and four more ensconced in the east. These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge. The necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage. My second, High Priestess MacDonnell, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here.Target: Felstone Field^53^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^High Priestess MacDonnell^Scourge Cauldron^The Scourge Cauldrons^^Felstone Field Cauldron^Go to Felstone Field in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there. It may have a key that will allow access to the cauldron. You must have the Empty Felstone Field Bottle with you to secure a sample of the poisons used inside the cauldron.^Of the four cauldrons here in the west, the one located at Felstone Field may be the easiest one in obtaining access to. The Scourge have greener troops positioned here, though they should not be underestimated. Go to Felstone Field, northwest of Andorhal, and engage the cauldron lord there. We think it has a key that will unlock access to the cauldron. When unlocked, use this bottle to obtain a sample of the poisons inside the cauldron; we'll need it for study in developing a counter agent.Return to Chillwind Camp^53^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Scourge Cauldron^High Priestess MacDonnell^The Scourge Cauldrons^^^Bring the Filled Felstone Field Bottle to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^You fill the bottle with enough of the cauldron's poisonous concoction for a suitable sample to be studied. With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission.Target: Dalson's Tears^55^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^High Priestess MacDonnell^Scourge Cauldron^The Scourge Cauldrons^^Dalson's Tears Cauldron^Go to Dalson's Tears in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron. You must have the Empty Dalson's Tears Bottle with you to secure a sample of the poisons used inside the cauldron.^One of the plague cauldrons is located in the field of a former farmhouse now referred to as Dalson's Tears. Well, we shall shed no tears this day as we thwart the Scourge and have them choke on their own fumes! Go to Dalson's Tears, almost due north of Andorhal, and eliminate the cauldron lord there. It should have a key like the last one did, allowing you into the cauldron. Use this bottle to obtain a sample from inside the cauldron; each cauldron has its own distinct brew of toxins it uses.Return to Chillwind Camp^55^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Scourge Cauldron^High Priestess MacDonnell^The Scourge Cauldrons^^^Bring the Filled Dalson's Tears Bottle to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^You carefully fill the bottle with enough of the cauldron's ichors for what you consider to be suitably sized sample. With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission.Target: Writhing Haunt^55^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^High Priestess MacDonnell^Scourge Cauldron^The Scourge Cauldrons^^Writhing Haunt Cauldron^Go to the Writhing Haunt in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron. You must have the Empty Writhing Haunt Bottle with you to secure a sample of the poisons used inside the cauldron.^Two cauldrons have been successfully opened; while you will be able to access them indefinitely, we still want to open up the other two that remain. This will provide all of us with more options to introduce the counter agent! This time, you'll be hitting the Writhing Haunt's cauldron. It is almost due east of Andorhal, relatively close to the ruined city walls; again, eliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key. Use this bottle to obtain the sample from the cauldron. Good hunting, <name>!Return to Chillwind Camp^55^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Scourge Cauldron^High Priestess MacDonnell^The Scourge Cauldrons^^^Bring the Filled Writhing Haunt Bottle to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^You delicately top off the empty bottle; a sample of the foul substance that churns under the platform of the cauldron now oozes back and forth inside the fragile glass container. With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission.Target: Gahrron's Withering^58^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^High Priestess MacDonnell^Scourge Cauldron^The Scourge Cauldrons^^Gahrron's Withering Cauldron^Go to Gahrron's Withering in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron. You must have the Empty Gahrron's Withering Bottle with you to secure a sample of the poisons used inside the cauldron.^The last cauldron that remains is located on a farm now called Gahrron's Withering. It is guarded by some of the Scourge's tougher minions - specifically, wraiths and ghosts. They are not to be trifled with, <name>. Gahrron's Withering is due northeast of our position here, close to where the Eastern Plaguelands begin; again, eliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key. Here is your empty sample bottle; bring it to me filled. May the Light protect you in this dangerous mission, <class>.Return to Chillwind Camp^58^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Scourge Cauldron^High Priestess MacDonnell^The Scourge Cauldrons^^Mission Accomplished!^Bring the Filled Gahrron's Withering Bottle to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^You carefully close the spigot in the control panel, watching the cauldron's putrid ichors drip into the empty bottle. With the poison in hand, it is time to return to High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp to complete the mission.The Scourge Cauldrons^53^Horde^Western Plaguelands^High Executor Derrington^Shadow Priestess Vandis^The Scourge Cauldrons^Scarlet Diversions^^Speak with Shadow Priestess Vandis at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four in the west, and four more entrenched in the east. These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge. The necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage. My second, Shadow Priestess Vandis, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here.Target: Felstone Field^53^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Shadow Priestess Vandis^Scourge Cauldron^The Scourge Cauldrons^^Felstone Field Cauldron^Go to Felstone Field in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there.

It sounds like he's far away, to the east. I hope he's not crying for me! <name>, will you find my uncle and tell him I'm alright? If you find him say I'm waiting for him, and I want to hear the story he used to tell... the one about the rabbits and the berry jam! That story's so funny!A Final Blow^58^All^Felwood^Greta Mosshoof^Greta Mosshoof^^Dousing the Flames of Protection^^Kill Moora and Salia, and bring Shadow Lord Fel'dan's Head to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood.^Unfortunately, I see the only way to stop this threat to Felwood is a frontal attack. There are no other ways into Shadow Hold, and I have no means to teleport you inside. The straight path down to the bottom is the only way... and I also know who you should seek out. His name is Fel'dan... Shadow Lord Fel'dan. He is the mortal in power down below... he is the head of the serpent. Kill him and his two succubus servants and return to me. Fel'dan is the one making pacts with the Legion. He must be stopped.Houses of the Holy^60^All^Stratholme^Leonid Barthalomew the Revered^Leonid Barthalomew the Revered^^^^Travel to Stratholme, in the north. Search the supply crates that litter the city and recover 5 Stratholme Holy Water. Return to Leonid Barthalomew the Revered when you have collected enough of the blessed fluid.^I look at my undeath as a malady, <race>. An illness that merely requires treatment; however, it is also a great blessing for the Argent Dawn. What better vessel to smite the heathens of the Scourge than through the undead? I am revered by my colleagues because of the sacrifices I have made, but the accolades mean nothing to me. If you are interested in assisting the Argent Dawn, then a job I can offer. Venture to Stratholme and recover our surplus of holy water. Search the supply crates.The Ruins of Kel'Theril^56^Alliance^Winterspring^Wynd Nightchaser^Jaron Stoneshaper^To Winterspring!^^^Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper in Starfall Village.^The story behind Kel'Theril is one of a cursed race, bound to the place where they attempted an unfortunate ritual... The highborne that you will find there once stole a sacred artifact, believing that they could siphon its power for themselves, becoming even more powerful. In their efforts, the relic shattered in a huge explosion, driving the pieces below the ice of the lake... Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper if you'd like to learn more; he has recently visited the area and can tell you more.Troubled Spirits of Kel'Theril^56^Alliance^Winterspring^Jaron Stoneshaper^Aurora Skycaller^To Winterspring!^^^Use Jaron's Pick to find the four Highborne Relic Fragments. Bring them to Aurora Skycaller in Eastern Plaguelands.^The highborne spirits are miserable creatures, that's for sure. They are still searching for pieces of the very thing that has cursed them to Kel'Theril forever -- the stolen relic. If you are that interested, take my pick and go south to the lake, see if you can gather the pieces of it from within the ice. Now, I can't tell you a thing about what you find, but I do know of someone who might... Aurora Skycaller; she dwells near the Northpass Tower in the northern part of Eastern Plaguelands.Fragments of the Past^56^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^Aurora Skycaller^Aurora Skycaller^To Winterspring!^^^Find the Sacred Highborne Writings in the Temple of Zin-Malor in Azshara, and bring them to Aurora Skycaller near the Northpass Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.^I did not realize... Forgive my callous words, <class>. The mistakes of my ancestors are not what I wish to dwell on, but if your request is truly genuine, then I will help you. <Aurora examines the fragments.> I believe this is the Crystal of Zin-Malor, an artifact that can contain and control strong arcane forces. It could have been used for good, but the evil intentions of those that stole it caused it to shatter. Go to the Temple of Zin-Malor in Azshara - I can only hope the book is still there.Fragments of the Past^57^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^Aurora Skycaller^Aurora Skycaller^To Winterspring!^^Tormented By the Past^Bring an Enchanted Thorium Bar, 5 Crystal Restore, and a Vial of Dire Water to Aurora Skycaller near the Northpass Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.^I will be able to help you, if recreating the artifact is truly what you wish to do. To seal the pieces back together, I will need items with strong magical qualities. An enchanted thorium bar and five crystal restore... You'll also need to collect some water from what might seem an unlikely place... Find the dire pool along Eldreth Row at Dire Maul in Feralas, and fill this vial. While you are gone, I will attempt to glean from these pages the knowledge I need to repair the damage done to the relic.Tormented By the Past^58^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^Aurora Skycaller^Remorseful Highborne^Tormented By the Past^Fragments of the Past^^Take the Crystal of Zin-Malor to Lake Kel'Theril in Winterspring and find a highborne spirit that will speak to you.^<name>, I weep for what has happened in the past. Like this crystal, the elves, as a race, have been shattered. I do not know if the pieces will ever again be reunited into one, but my sorrow has been eased by being able to help you with this one small task. We must not forget the past, <name>... Please take the Crystal of Zin-Malor back to Lake Kel'Theril. You must find a highborne spirit that realizes the error of what was done so long ago. Show the spirit that we have made things right again.To Winterspring!^56^Alliance^Felwood^Ivy Leafrunner^Wynd Nightchaser^To Winterspring!^^^Find Starfall Village in Winterspring and speak with Wynd Nightchaser.^In Winterspring, to the north of here, there are many ancient elven ruins. It's a harsh land, but it holds many secrets and places to explore. With all my work to do here in Felwood, I have not had the opportunity to travel to Winterspring. But there's no reason why you shouldn't! While you're there, look for Wynd Nightchaser. He spends most of his time in Starfall Village and he knows a lot about the area.Starfall^56^Alliance^Winterspring^Daryn Lightwind^Wynd Nightchaser^Starfall^^^Find Starfall in Winterspring and speak with Wynd Nightchaser.^In Winterspring, to the north of Felwood, there are many ancient elven ruins. It's a harsh land, but it holds many secrets and places to explore. My studies here keep me so busy that I have not had the opportunity to travel to Winterspring for some time. But there's no reason why you shouldn't travel there and study the ruins. While you're there, look for Wynd Nightchaser. He spends most of his time in Starfall and he knows a lot about the area. Tell him that you are a student of mine...The Archivist^60^All^Stratholme^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^^^The Truth Comes Crashing Down^Travel to Stratholme and find Archivist Galford of the Scarlet Crusade. Destroy him and burn down the Scarlet Archive.^Anything taken to an extreme is hazardous to our world, <name>. Take for example, the Scarlet Crusade. Do you believe that their blind zealotry serves a greater good? How many innocents have they destroyed in the name of the Light? Blasphemers, one and all! One in particular interests me, though; the Archivist Galford of Stratholme: A man that watches over the Crusade's most valued documents. Destroy him and burn down his archives! Should you succeed, return to me and be rewarded.Remorseful Highborne^58^Alliance^Winterspring^Remorseful Highborne^Wynd Nightchaser^Tormented By the Past^^^Speak with Wynd Nightchaser in Starfall Village, and ask about the proper place for the Crystal of Zin-Malor.^The... the crystal... The highborne here are clouded by their own misssery... I am sorrrrrowful, but I realize the errorrrr of what happened so long ago. Even though there is no waaaay to change the past, I am now at peacccce knowing that you have recovered the crystal of Zin-Malor... Youuu must return it... It muuuussst be returrrned.The Crystal of Zin-Malor^58^Alliance^Winterspring^Wynd Nightchaser^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^Tormented By the Past^^^Deliver the Crystal of Zin-Malor to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.^Quite impressive, <name>. The crystal of Zin-Malor can never be returned to the temple which, as you know, lies in ruin. But I believe that your effort to undo the evil of the past should not go unrewarded. Seek out Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus, and bring the crystal to him, <name>. It should be in the hands of those that will not abuse its power. From the looks of it, only a handful of the strongest magic users would be able to control such a power.Eagan Peltskinner^2^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Deputy Willem^Eagan Peltskinner^Eagan Peltskinner^A Threat Within^^Speak with Eagan Peltskinner.^Eagan Peltskinner is looking for someone to hunt diseased wolves for him. That's good news, because we're seeing a lot more diseased wolves in Northshire Valley lately. If you're interested then speak with Eagan. He's around the side of the abbey, to the left.The Truth Comes Crashing Down^60^All^Stratholme^Head of Balnazzar^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^The Truth Comes Crashing Down^The Archivist^^Take the Head of Balnazzar to Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You try and gather your thoughts as the dust settles across the chamber. You go over the events that just transpired and still cannot comprehend the gravity of the situation. The Grand Crusader of the Scarlet Crusade a demon? And not just any demon but brother to Varimathras, arch lord of the Undercity? You carefully stow the severed head of the dreadlord into your pack. Surely, none would believe the tale you would tell without proof. Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff must be told at once!Above and Beyond^60^All^Stratholme^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^The Truth Comes Crashing Down^^Lord Maxwell Tyrosus^Venture to Stratholme and destroy Baron Rivendare. Take his head and return to Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff.^You display a natural aptitude for destruction and you follow orders. It is rare to see the two coexist. I am beginning to think that you may make an excellent vehicle of divine justice. <Zverenhoff clasps his hands together in front of his face.> Kel'Thuzad's errand boy rules over Stratholme. Prove to me that you are a champion - my champion. Destroy Baron Rivendare and return to me with his head.Lord Maxwell Tyrosus^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^Lord Maxwell Tyrosus^Lord Maxwell Tyrosus^Above and Beyond^^Speak with Lord Maxwell Tyrosus. He is inside the church.^I am about to bestow a great honor upon you, <name>. Lord Maxwell wishes to reward you for your service to the Argent Dawn! It has been years since Maxwell has granted audience to outsiders.The Argent Hold^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Lord Maxwell Tyrosus^The Argent Hold^Lord Maxwell Tyrosus^^^Open the Argent Hold and claim your reward.^Through the years the Argent Hold has remained locked.

The Argent Hold is now open to you, <name>.The Restless Souls^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Caretaker Alen^Egan^The Restless Souls^^^Find Egan. You only know that he was last seen around Stratholme.^There are those that died tragically in the fall of Stratholme. Many took their own lives, opting to hurl themselves into the myriad flames of the smoldering city rather than become one of the Scourge. They now walk the streets of Stratholme as restless spirits. We must aid them, <name>! I have an associate named Egan who has been doing miraculous work with ghosts and souls. Seek him out. He walks the eastern Plaguelands, near Stratholme, testing his innovations.The Restless Souls^60^All^Stratholme^Egan^Egan^The Restless Souls^^^Use Egan's Blaster on the ghostly and spectral citizens of Stratholme. When the restless souls break free from their ghostly shells, use the blaster again - freedom will be theirs!^I draw my power - my will to continue living and breathing - from the unmitigated hatred I have for the Scourge and all that they have done. I am, however, no zealot. There are those, like the Scarlet Crusade, who would sooner destroy the innocent undead than lend them even an ounce of compassion. Which brings me to this: My blaster. It will unchain the tortured souls from Stratholme. Use it on the ghosts that haunt the ransacked streets. Free their souls.The Art of the Armorsmith^40^Alliance^Blacksmithing^Grumnus Steelshaper^Grumnus Steelshaper^^^^To become an Armorsmith, you must make the following items and return them to Grumnus: 4 Ornate Mithril Helms, 2 Ornate Mithril Boots, 1 Ornate Mithril Breastplate.^So ye made the smart decision.

While the workload can be unbearable at times, the riches more than make up for the back strain and ash lung. Oh yes, <name>, weaponsmiths are the ones with all the gold! If you wish to join our ranks, you'll need to show me that you can make me a silver or two - I mean, show me that you've got what it takes to be the go to <guy/girl> when people need superior quality weapons. Get to work!The Art of the Armorsmith^40^Horde^Blacksmithing^Okothos Ironrager^Okothos Ironrager^^^^To become an armorsmith, you must make the following items and return them to Okothos: 4 Ornate Mithril Helms, 2 Ornate Mithril Boots, 1 Ornate Mithril Breastplate.^Satisfaction. It is what I draw from the hammer and the anvil. To see a proud Horde warrior protected under my steel reminds me of what it is to be alive. It is an addiction that I dare never give up, <name>.

If you wish to be one of the select few, you need only to ask and I shall train, but, a task you must first complete.The Way of the Weaponsmith^40^Horde^Blacksmithing^Borgosh Corebender^Borgosh Corebender^^^^To become a Weaponsmith, you must make the following items and return them to Borgosh: 4 Moonsteel Broadswords, 4 Massive Iron Axes, 2 Heavy Mithril Axes, and 2 Big Black Maces.^One day, I will create a legendary hammer.

Simple for one of your exceptional skill.Sweet Serenity^60^All^Blacksmithing^Lilith the Lithe^Lilith the Lithe^^^^Travel to Stratholme and kill the Crimson Hammersmith. Recover the Crimson Hammersmith's Apron and return to Lilith.^Within the confines of the Scarlet Bastion lies sweet Serenity. The Crimson Hammersmith guards the recipe with his life. Defeat him and bring me his apron. For that, I shall reward you with the knowledge required to create an enchanted battlehammer!Snakestone of the Shadow Huntress^60^All^Blacksmithing^Kilram^Kilram^^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and slay Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin. Recover Vosh'gajin's Snakestone and return to Kilram.^Don't let her beauty fool you, <class>. The shadow huntress, Vosh'gajin is deadly and deranged. <Kilram points to the scar on his face.> Aye, she gave me that - a love tap, she called it. The time for vengeance has finally come. You can find Vosh'gajin in Blackrock Spire. Slay her and return to me with her snakestone. Do this and I will teach you the secret to crafting Dawn's Edge!Corruption^60^All^Blacksmithing^Seril Scourgebane^Seril Scourgebane^^^^Find the Black Guard Swordsmith in Stratholme and destroy him. Recover the Insignia of the Black Guard and return to Seril Scourgebane.^If I am short with you, it is for a reason. The plans for the creation of the great blade, Corruption, have been stolen by the Black Guard: Elite skeletal units of Baron Rivendare. Yes, Baron Rivendare of Stratholme.

Slay him and return proof of this deed and I shall grant you the knowledge required to create a blazing rapier!The Sleeper Has Awakened^20^All^Darkshore^Kerlonian Evershade^Liladris Moonriver^^^^Escort Kerlonian Evershade to Liladris Moonriver at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale.^I was on my way to Maestra's Post to meet Liladris Moonriver, but I decided to stop here and take a short nap. Ever since I awoke from the emerald dream, I have been so sleepy...  Would you mind showing me the way? I understand that Maestra's Post is south of here, along the road in Ashenvale. It can be dangerous, so I hope you have some friends that will join us. Lastly, I may fall asleep so if you ever need to wake me, please use my horn. You'll find it in the chest here.Barov Family Fortune^60^Horde^Scholomance^Alexi Barov^Alexi Barov^Barov Family Fortune^^^Venture to the Scholomance and recover the Barov family fortune. Four deeds make up this fortune: The Deed to Caer Darrow; The Deed to Brill; The Deed to Tarren Mill; and The Deed to Southshore. Return to Alexi Barov when you have completed this task.^Within the Scholomance lays the Barov family fortune. I, Alexi Barov, am one of the last two remaining heirs of the house Barov. My brother, Weldon, is the other. Weldon, the miserable coward, fled during the war and thus retained his worthless existence as a human. He now searches for the deeds so that he may claim the fortune for his own. Recover the deeds before my brother does and I shall make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams!The Last Barov^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Alexi Barov^Alexi Barov^Barov Family Fortune^^^Travel to Chillwind Camp - Alliance territory - and assassinate Weldon Barov. Take his head and return to Alexi Barov.^Naturally, with my brother still alive, there may be some contention as to the primary beneficiary of the family's fortune. This cannot be. A low down guttersnipe like you isn't above a little cold-blooded murder, I hope. It's a simple task and one that I expect you will complete; that is, if you wish to claim your reward. Weldon sits under Alliance protection at Chillwind Camp, to the east. Slay him, return his head. <Alexi yawns.> Hurry along now.Barov Family Fortune^60^Alliance^Scholomance^Weldon Barov^Weldon Barov^Barov Family Fortune^^^Venture to the Scholomance and recover the Barov family fortune. Four deeds make up this fortune: The Deed to Caer Darrow; The Deed to Brill; The Deed to Tarren Mill; and The Deed to Southshore. Return to Weldon Barov when you have completed this task.^My dear brother Alexi. What a fool I was to spare his life. I looked into the face of the enemy, one of the undead, and let him live. <Weldon spits.> He now searches for MY inheritance. This simply cannot happen. Find my family's deeds before that vile retch gets his boney hands upon them and I shall reward you with vast riches. They lay in the ruins of the Scholomance. Make haste!The Last Barov^60^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Weldon Barov^Weldon Barov^Barov Family Fortune^^^Travel to the Bulwark - Horde territory - and assassinate Alexi Barov. Take his head and return to Weldon Barov.^With the deeds recovered, there is but one thing left to do. Alexi must be killed. With him dead, I need not ever worry about an unscrupulous gang of mercenaries seeking my head. It's a simple task. Alexi hides under the protection of the Horde - at the Bulwark. No, I do not expect you to just walk up and kill him, I want his head! How you get it... well, that part is up to you. That type of behavior is below one of my noble upbringing.Family Tree^35^Horde^Thousand Needles^Cliffwatcher Longhorn^Nataka Longhorn^^^^Deliver Cliffwatcher Longhorn Report to Nataka Longhorn at Ghost Walker Post in Desolace.^My brother Nataka is stationed at Ghost Walker Post over in Desolace.

Find the porch and place the Blood of Innocents in the brazier. Kirtonos will come to feast upon your soul.^This is it, <name>. <Eva points to the vial inside the bag.> The blood of innocents. The purest blood, used to appease Krastinov's master. It is with this blood that Kirtonos may be summoned. It is with this blood, then, that Kirtonos must be destroyed. Take the blood to the porch. Place it upon the brazier. Kirtonos will come - he cannot resist. When he appears, unleash the fury and wrath of a thousand innocent deaths upon him. Should you succeed, you will earn more than just our gratitude.The Remains of Trey Lightforge^57^All^Felwood^Remains of Trey Lightforge^Jessir Moonbow^Rescue From Jaedenar^^^Return the Remains of Trey Lightforge to Jessir Moonbow in Felwood.^You pick up the sack carefully and prepare to make your way back to Jessir Moonbow on the border of Felwood and Ashenvale.

The trolls at Shadowprey Village are the best at catching fish... but alas, with all the centaur activities I have little time to make a journey to the trolls. Hrm... Do me a favor and journey to Shadowprey Village. Talk to the local fisherman Jinar'Zillen and bring me back my favorite, Bloodbelly fish. The road south of here will take you west to the troll village.Lazy Peons^4^All^Durotar^Foreman Thazz'ril^Foreman Thazz'ril^^^Thazz'ril's Pick^Use the Foreman's Blackjack on Lazy Peons when they're sleeping. Wake up 5 peons, then return the Foreman's Blackjack to Foreman Thazz'ril in the Valley of Trials.^Cursed peons!

Here, you take this blackjack and use it on any lazy peons you find sleeping on the job. A good smack will get them right back to work! Return the blackjack when you're done. Lousy slacking peons...The Human, Ras Frostwhisper^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Magistrate Marduke^Magistrate Marduke^The Human, Ras Frostwhisper^Kirtonos the Herald^^Travel to the Arathi Highlands, to the ruins of Stromgarde. Search Stromgarde for a Keepsake of Remembrance. If you find such an item, return with it to Magistrate Marduke.^The undead fear life just as the living fear death. It is not unusual for a sentient undead being to completely destroy all remnants of his or her previous life after having turned. Unfortunately, in order to create an artifact capable of reverting Ras Frostwhisper to a mortal, we must have a keepsake from his years among the living. You must venture to the ruined city of Stromgarde, Frostwhisper's home, and search for such an item. May luck be with you, <name>.The Dying, Ras Frostwhisper^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Magistrate Marduke^Leonid Barthalomew the Revered^The Human, Ras Frostwhisper^^^Travel to Light's Hope in Eastern Plaguelands and seek out Leonid Barthalomew the Revered. Show him the Keepsake of Remembrance and tell him all that you have discovered.^Upon tainted soil, the keepsake must be attuned. It is rumored that Stratholme is where Frostwhisper succumbed to the Lich King. Upon those bloodied grounds he gave his life - freely and with motive - to become one of the undying. It is those grounds that must be found. There is one, an undead dissenter of the Scourge, freed by the Banshee Queen but loyal to the cause of the Argent Dawn. Find him: Leonid Barthalomew the Revered. He may know more. Seek out Light's Hope, <name>.Menethil's Gift^60^All^Stratholme^Leonid Barthalomew the Revered^Menethil's Gift^The Human, Ras Frostwhisper^^^Travel to Stratholme and find Menethil's Gift. Place the Keepsake of Remembrance upon the unholy ground.^I watched as the human, Ras Frostwhisper, pledged his undying soul to the Lich King. He drew the dagger to his own throat and with a smile, cut from ear to ear. His body collapsed inside the borders of the pentagram. The Lich King stood over the fallen mage and with a single motion, Ras Frostwhisper the lich, was born. <Leonid gazes at the ground and then looks up at you.> Yes, <race>, I remember. What you seek has a name - Menethil's Gift: The ground blessed by the Lich King - holy ground to Scourge.Menethil's Gift^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Menethil's Gift^Leonid Barthalomew the Revered^The Human, Ras Frostwhisper^^^Take the Soulbound Keepsake to Leonid Barthalomew in Eastern Plaguelands.^The soul of the fallen clings to that which represents its former life and transforms the item into a soulbound keepsake.

When you have found him, use the Soulbound Keepsake on his undead visage. Should you succeed in reverting him to a mortal, strike him down and recover the Human Head of Ras Frostwhisper. Take the head back to Magistrate Marduke.^There is but one task remaining, <name>. Confront the lich, Ras Frostwhisper, in his lair. Use the power of the keepsake against the beast - be unrelenting in your actions! Weather the blows that the flailing beast will surely bring down upon you. Do not give in to the pain! When the ritual is complete, Ras will be mortal once more. It is at that point that he must be slain. Strike him down and take his human head.Gordo's Task^5^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Gordo^Junior Apothecary Holland^Gordo's Task^^^Collect 3 Gloom Weed and deliver them to Junior Apothecary Holland in the Brill graveyard.^Master want weeds.

That thing is out there collecting the wrong weeds! I'll make it worth your while to gather what I need. Bring back to me enough doom weed and I'll give you a suitable reward. It is my understanding that they like to plague the flora near the mass gravesite, to the north of the Brill graveyard. Hurry and be mindful of the gnolls in the area.Bone Collector^32^All^Desolace^Bibbly F'utzbuckle^Bibbly F'utzbuckle^^^^Bring 10 Kodo Bones from the Kodo Graveyard to Bibbly F'utzbuckle at Kormek's Hut.^We're sitting on a goldmine here, I tell you - a goldmine! Kodo bones will change the world forever... I have customers making furniture, music instruments, and even blasting powder out of them. There's a caravan that comes by and picks up my kodo bones and then sells them at Shadowprey Village. If you can travel to the kodo graveyard south of here and bring me ten kodo bones, I'll give you something in return. Is it a deal?Mantles of the Dawn^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Argent Quartermaster Hasana^Argent Quartermaster Hasana^^^^Bring 10 Argent Dawn Valor Tokens to Quartermaster Hasana at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^Your service to the Argent Dawn is to be commended, <name>.

He peddles his skills to the highest bidder in Gadgetzan, within the Tanaris desert. He'll likely be the only one who can produce the mold we need, and his services won't come cheap. We now ask for you to dig deep by footing whatever fee he will charge. I'm an apothecary, not a banker. If I had gold lying around, I certainly wouldn't be here. I guess I said the quiet part out loud again. Oops. Gadgetzan awaits you! Good luck!Krastinov's Bag of Horrors^60^All^Scholomance^Eva Sarkhoff^Eva Sarkhoff^Doctor Theolen Krastinov, the Butcher^^^Locate Jandice Barov in the Scholomance and destroy her. From her corpse recover Krastinov's Bag of Horrors. Return the bag to Eva Sarkhoff.^A great weight has been lifted from our hearts, <name>, but your task is not yet complete. Krastinov's master, Kirtonos, still lives. Before you may face Kirtonos, however, you must first secure a method in which to summon him. It is said that Jandice Barov stewards the blood of innocents from Krastinov to Kirtonos. Find her in the sunken catacombs of Scholomance and strike her down. Bring back any clues that you may find.Chromatic Mantle of the Dawn^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock^Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock^^^^Bring 25 Argent Dawn Valor Tokens to Quartermaster Breechlock at Light's Hope Chapel, Eastern Plaguelands.^<Brother /Sister> <name> - your deeds on behalf of the Argent Dawn are far too numerous to be recounted easily.

He is currently chained inside the Gordok wing of Dire Maul.^If you're going to fight the king of this dump - and I think that's what you're bound to do - then you're going to need to get by Captain Kromcrush. Now, you can get by him by killing him, sure. You might actually want to leave him alive. How, you ask? Since I've been here, I think I know how to make an ogre suit that will last just long enough to fool these bozos. The only problem is stability - ten minutes tops. Bring me what I need, and I'll make you one. I'm not going anywhere...Chromatic Mantle of the Dawn^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Argent Quartermaster Lightspark^Argent Quartermaster Lightspark^^^^Bring 25 Argent Dawn Valor Tokens to Quartermaster Lightspark at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^<Brother /Sister> <name> - your deeds on behalf of the Argent Dawn are far too numerous to be recounted easily.

Well, the message wasn't really from Vectus...it was from someone named Leonid Barthalomew. I don't know Leonid, but he knew my master, and no one knows my master unless he allows it. Leonid says Vectus wants the dragon eggs. He wants you to deliver them to him at the Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands. That hurts! Why you? Doesn't Vectus trust me? Oh, never mind... just take the eggs and tell Leonid that I did what our master commanded.Chromatic Mantle of the Dawn^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Argent Quartermaster Hasana^Argent Quartermaster Hasana^^^^Bring 25 Argent Dawn Valor Tokens to Quartermaster Hasana at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^<Brother /Sister> <name> - your deeds on behalf of the Argent Dawn are far too numerous to be recounted easily.

Chances are you'll only be able to procure one with the demise of Alzzin the Wildshaper. Use the Reliquary of Purity to securely seal the shard inside, and return it to Rabine Saturna in Nighthaven, Moonglade.^Your knowledge of Eldre'Thalas - Dire Maul - in Feralas will now come into play, <name>. In the eastern part of the ruined city is where Alzzin the Wildshaper has exerted his corrupt dominion. Go there with all due haste and brave whatever challenges await you. The Fruit of Fertility, now corrupted as the Felvine, should be close to Alzzin. When he falls, capture whatever essence of the Felvine you can. Seal it in the Reliquary, and bring it to me. Good luck, and Cenarion's speed.A Reliquary of Purity^60^All^Moonglade^Rabine Saturna^Rabine Saturna^A Reliquary of Purity^^^Travel to Silithus and search for a Reliquary of Purity within the ruins of Southwind Village. If you are able to find it, return with it to Rabine Saturna in Nighthaven, Moonglade.^The first step is to find a container capable of holding an extremely corruptible substance without the handler suffering ill effects. There is only one sort device I am aware of that could possibly contain something as vile as the Felvine: a Reliquary of Purity. Deep in the wasteland of Silithus is the remnants of the night elf village known as Southwind. I know one was there many, many years ago. If we are to succeed, I need you to scour those ruins in the hopes of reclaiming it.Plagued Hatchlings^58^All^Scholomance^Betina Bigglezink^Betina Bigglezink^^^Healthy Dragon Scale^Kill 20 Plagued Hatchlings, then return to Betina Bigglezink at the Light's Hope Chapel.^The Argent Dawn recently learned that the Scourge are creating their own plagued dragonflight! We must stop them -- if the Scourge gain a force of dragons they'll sweep across Azeroth unchecked! Their necromancers are breeding plagued dragons at the Scholomance, in the middle of Darrowmere Lake. Go to the Scholomance and kill as many hatchlings as you can... before they get any bigger!Betina Bigglezink^60^All^Scholomance^Leonid Barthalomew the Revered^Betina Bigglezink^Leonid Barthalomew^^^Bring the Frozen Eggs to Betina Bigglezink.^The eggs you brought were to be used in Scourge experiments to create a plagued dragonflight. These frozen black dragon eggs would have been invaluable in their studies, and would have assuredly quickened their timetable. Now, it is time we ended their research. Take the frozen eggs to Betina Bigglezink outside. She is well-learned in science and alchemy, and has produced a weapon we can use against the Scourge. With your help, we will deal them a heavy blow.Scholomance^55^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Alchemist Arbington^Scholomance^All Along the Watchtowers^^Speak with Alchemist Arbington at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands.^On the island of Caer Darrow lies Scholomance - a wretched center of Scourge necromancy and evil. Our enemy dwells within, conducting unspeakable acts of depravity on unwitting victims... at least, we surmise as much. A door bars the way, and try as we might no entry is to be had without a proper key. Alchemist Arbington is well versed on Scholomance, and has an idea how to obtain a key. You have proved your worth to me, and now I entrust this task to you. Speak with him on this matter.Kim'jael's "Missing" Equipment^53^All^Azshara^Kim'jael^Kim'jael^^Kim'jael Indeed!^^Find Some Rune that the naga have in their possession in the Ruins of Eldarath and return it to Kim'jael in Azshara.^What?! What?! That wasn't good enough for you? You know how expensive those explosives are? They sell for... oh, nevermind. Fine, you want to make some real money? Cause that's how business is done: you prove you're a valuable employee and then you're rewarded adequately after you stick it out some. If you're a "valuable" employee, then hit the Ruins of Eldarath and find me some rune that them Blood elves were lookin' for. The naga apparently have it in their possession.Spiritual Unrest^47^All^Azshara^Loh'atu^Loh'atu^^^^Destroy 6 Highborne Apparitions and 6 Highborne Lichlings before returning to Loh'atu in Azshara.^Long ago, the Highborne were some of the most powerful students of the arcane the night elves ever produced. The corruption that comes along with such studies caused much harm to night elf society and greatly affected all of Azeroth... as I'm sure you well know. I promised the Sentinels that I would release the spirits from their mortal bonds as I find them. If you would do the same, then I am sure I can reward you some. The spirits haunt the Shadowsong Shrine to the northeast of here.A Land Filled with Hatred^47^All^Azshara^Loh'atu^Loh'atu^^^^Kill 6 Haldarr Satyr, 2 Haldarr Tricksters, 2 Haldarr Felsworn and then return to Loh'atu on the border of Ashenvale.^The satyr, a disfigured, evil aspect of the night elves, now infect the sacred lands once traveled by Cenarius. I cannot speak for the night elves when it comes to all the atrocities those demonic creatures have committed, but I have sworn an oath to the Earthmother to aid the elves in ridding the land of such a nuisance. I am sure you would prove yourself if you aided me in purging them. Northeast of here, you can find the Haldarr clan. Return to me after you've tested yourself against their power.Skeletal Fragments^57^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Alchemist Arbington^Alchemist Arbington^Scholomance^^^Bring 15 Skeletal Fragments to Alchemist Arbington at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands.^The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key. It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold. A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function. First thing's first though, <name>. We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging. Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too.Mold Rhymes With...^57^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Alchemist Arbington^Krinkle Goodsteel^Scholomance^^^Bring the Imbued Skeletal Fragments and 15 gold coins to Krinkle Goodsteel in Gadgetzan.^The goblin you will need to speak with is Krinkle Goodsteel. He peddles his skills to the highest bidder in Gadgetzan, within the Tanaris desert. He'll likely be the only one who can produce the mold we need, and his services won't come cheap. We now ask for you to dig deep by footing whatever fee he will charge. I'm an alchemist, not a banker. If I had gold lying around, I certainly wouldn't be here. I guess I said the quiet part out loud again. Oops. Gadgetzan awaits you! Good luck!Ammo for Rumbleshot^6^Alliance^Dun Morogh^Loslor Rudge^Hegnar Rumbleshot^^^^Bring Rumbleshot's Ammo to Hegnar Rumbleshot in Dun Morogh.^Hegnar Rumbleshot sells guns off the road to Anvilmar. Riflemen and mortar teams spend a lot of time practicing out near his shop, and he's always needing fresh ammunition. But... the last crate of ammo I sent him got lost along the way. My courier said he was camped near the Grizzled Den when wendigo chased him away... and the fool left Rumbleshot's ammo behind! <name>, can you get that ammo and take it to Rumbleshot? He's been waiting on it and I'm sure he's running low.Demon Dogs^56^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Tirion Fordring^^^Redemption^Slay 20 Plaguehound Runts, 5 Plaguehounds and 5 Frenzied Plaguehounds. Return to Tirion Fordring when the task is complete.^If you are going to remain here, I ask only that you earn your keep. We have many nuisances that could use some 'discipline.' You can start with the Plaguehounds and their runts. I cannot offer much in return, but you are guaranteed a warm meal and some conversation should you succeed.Blood Tinged Skies^56^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Tirion Fordring^^^^Slay 30 Plaguebats and return to Tirion Fordring.^Woe to those that foolishly wander into the Plaguelands. All manner of foulness inhabit these woods - from the fanatical Scarlet Crusade, who will kill any that do not bear the mark of the Crusade, to the murderous Scourge, who only look to bolster their numbers by adding more undead to their ranks. Even the wildlife have been transformed into rapacious, man eating beasts. I ask that you destroy those that would strike from the skies: The Plaguebats.Carrion Grubbage^56^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Tirion Fordring^^^^Seek out the Carrion Grubs and Devourers of the region. Slay them and harvest their meat. Return to Tirion Fordring when you have gathered 15 Slabs of Carrion Worm Meat.^My food supplies are running low, <race>. I am ashamed to admit that I might not have enough food to share with you. Could you assist an old man with a simple task? Around here, the only manner of beast unaffected by the ravages of the Plague are the Carrion worms. While rather bland in taste, the meat of the worms can easily be preserved to last for months. I will need several hundred pounds to restock for the coming winter!A Bundle of Trouble^9^Alliance^Elwynn Forest^Supervisor Raelen^Supervisor Raelen^^^^Bring 8 Bundles of Wood to Raelen at the Eastvale Logging Camp.^I've got a real problem on my hands. I have a deadline looming for an order of lumber, and I'm running out of time. The wolves and bears north of here have chased my workers away from the bundles of wood that they've already chopped. I've already talked to Deputy Rainer about clearing the animals, but I need someone to go collect the wood for me. If you could collect eight bundles of wood for me I might just make my deadline.Kodo Roundup^34^All^Desolace^Smeed Scrabblescrew^Smeed Scrabblescrew^^^^Bring five Tamed Kodos and the Kodo Kombobulator back to Smeed Scrabblescrew at Scrabblescrew's Camp.^Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money. Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me. Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged and dying kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership. Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient, aged, or dying kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you. Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me.Portals of the Legion^38^Horde^Desolace^Taiga Wisemane^Taiga Wisemane^Hand of Iruxos^^^Banish 6 Portals at Mannoroc Coven and return to Taiga Wisemane at Shadowprey Village.^Behold - the Hand of Iruxos. A gruesome sight indeed. You must possess it if the demon portals at Mannoroc Coven are to be banished... which is what I now ask you to do. The Demon threat is increasing and we must close these portals to stem the tide of demons to this world. Good luck, <name>... and be wary of the portal guardians.Healthy Dragon Scale^58^All^Scholomance^Healthy Dragon Scale^Betina Bigglezink^^Plagued Hatchlings^^Bring the Healthy Dragon Scale to Betina Bigglezink at the Light's Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands.^This is a scale shed from a plagued dragon hatchling. But unlike the other pocked, oozing scales on the infant beast, this rare scale is healthy and unmarred. Betina Bigglezink will want a sample of this to study.Sister Pamela^55^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Jessica Redpath^Pamela Redpath^Sister Pamela^^Pamela's Doll^Find Pamela Redpath in Darrowshire.^I fled Lordaeron during the great war, and was lucky to escape before the Scourge swept through my homeland and turned it into a plagued nightmare! I was lucky, but my family was not. I fear they were all killed during the battle of Darrowshire. Darrowshire is a village in the Eastern Kingdoms, nestled in the southern hills of what is now the Eastern Plaguelands. Will you go there and search for my family? I miss them so much, especially my little sister Pamela. Please, find her for me!Garments of the Moon^4^Night Elf^Priest^Laurna Morninglight^Laurna Morninglight^In Favor of Elune^^^Find Sentinel Shaya and heal her wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant her Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Laurna Morninglight in Dolanaar.^I need your help, <name>. I am needed here to train the other students, but you, you can help one of our injured Sentinels just south of Dolanaar. She was hurt patrolling the town and could use our aid. Her name is Shaya. When you find her, heal her wounds, and then fortify her body with your spells. This will at least protect her from harm longer if she finds trouble. Return to me here after you've done your duty to Elune.In Favor of Elune^4^Night Elf^Priest^Shanda^Laurna Morninglight^In Favor of Elune^^^Speak to Laurna Morninglight in Teldrassil.^<name>, you must travel to Dolanaar when your business here in Shadowglen is done. There, you will find Laurna Morninglight. She will instruct you further in the ways of Elune, and it is with her that you will earn your first garments denoting your station as a <priest/priestess> of Elune. Take care, and may you be protected in your journeys.In Favor of the Light^4^Alliance^Priest^Priestess Anetta^Priestess Josetta^In Favor of the Light^^Garments of the Light^Speak to Priestess Josetta in Elwynn Forest.^Hello again, young <priest/priestess>. The time has come for you to learn more about our religion. After you've completed whatever tasks you have here in Northshire, please seek out Priestess Josetta in Goldshire. She has more to teach you and has heard that you are growing strong in the ways of the Light. She looks forward to tutoring you more.Garments of the Light^4^Alliance^Priest^Priestess Josetta^Priestess Josetta^In Favor of the Light^^^Find Guard Roberts and heal his wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant him Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Priestess Josetta in Goldshire.^Normally I put forth a small challenge to followers of the Light to test their skill. I want to see if they are worthy of wearing their first robes--a sign that the church outwardly approves of the <priest/priestess> and supports <him/her>. But this situation is a bit different. One of Goldshire's citizens saw an injured guard near the lake to the east of here. His name is Roberts. Find him, heal him, fortify his body and return here. If you can do that for me, then I will consider your test complete.Garments of the Light^4^Alliance^Priest^Maxan Anvol^Maxan Anvol^In Favor of the Light^^^Find Mountaineer Dolf and heal his wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant him Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Maxan Anvol in Kharanos.^It's usually about this time that one of your power is tested to see if they're worthy of wearing robes denoting their place in the church. But to be honest, I got more pressing matters to look into. Citizen of Kharanos' just came in here and told me 'bout a hurt mountaineer just outside town to the south--name's Dolf. You heal Dolf and give him Fortitude, and I'll consider you done with proving yourself. How's that sound?In Favor of the Light^4^Alliance^Priest^Branstock Khalder^Maxan Anvol^In Favor of the Light^^Garments of the Light^Speak to Maxan Anvol in Dun Morogh.^Hey! <name>! Got a minute?! Ya been following the Light now for long enough that you find your way to Maxan Anvol in Kharanos. He'll teach ya more about the path yer following, and if you prove worthy, give ya yer first set of robes to denote your station as a <priest/priestess>. Now get goin'! As soon as yer done here, head through the tunnel--he'll be waitin' for ya.Garments of Spirituality^4^Horde^Priest^Tai'jin^Tai'jin^In Favor of Spirituality^^^Find Grunt Kor'ja and heal her wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant her Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Tai'jin at Razor Hill.^You be ready for your first test, <name>. South of Razor Hill, just outta town, one of our grunts be hurt fightin' off some o' Proudmoore's old troops. She not doin' too well, an' she benefit much if one of our kind could help her. Find her--her name be Kor'ja--heal her wounds, an' give her the blessin' of our ancestors. You do this, an' me thinks that be sufficient proof that you ready to move on in our ways.In Favor of Spirituality^4^Horde^Priest^Ken'jai^Tai'jin^In Favor of Spirituality^^Garments of Spirituality^Speak to Tai'jin in Durotar.^Aye, mon. Our kind have joined the Horde because they be good for us. They loyal, and they teach us much 'bout tings like honor. But our old ways die hard. The orcs may not approve of all our traditions, but that not mean we can't continue to practice some them in secret. You know this, an' that's why I send you to Tai'jin in Razor Hill. She teach you more 'bout our history. She teach you the ways of our tribe. Go to her when you be ready.Garments of Darkness^4^Horde^Priest^Dark Cleric Beryl^Dark Cleric Beryl^In Favor of Darkness^^^Find Deathguard Kel and heal his wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant him Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Dark Cleric Beryl in Brill.^Our power comes from darkness and shadow, <name>, but that is not your only role. You have acknowledged that there is merit in knowing the healing arts. This is wise. But before you can know the dark, you must also know the light. And for this, I have a test for you. North of the cemetery is a wounded Deathguard--Deathguard Kel. He has protected us from gnolls for some time, and needs healing. But, you must also fortify his body before he can return to duty. Do both with your spells, and then return to me.In Favor of Darkness^4^Horde^Priest^Dark Cleric Duesten^Dark Cleric Beryl^In Favor of Darkness^^Garments of Spirituality^Speak to Dark Cleric Beryl in Tirisfal Glades.^There are many lessons that the Forsaken have learned through experience--things that some races can only begin to fathom. And although our path lies in darkness, you will find that a great many things rely on both the light and the dark. Your lessons shall teach you to use both... and with discretion. But heed my words: never forget we were forged in corruption and left to rot like so much carrion. The Darkness is our home. Seek out Dark Cleric Beryl in Brill when you're ready to learn more.One Shot. One Kill.^15^All^Darkshore^Sentinel Aynasha^Sentinel Onaeya^^^^Protect Sentinel Aynasha, then speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post in Ashenvale.^I was traveling to Auberdine with an important message when I was attacked by the furbolg Marosh and his trackers. During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready. I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can. Should we survive, I will be able to deliver my message to Auberdine, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident.The Battle of Darrowshire^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Chromie^Pamela Redpath^Marauders of Darrowshire^^^Place the Relic Bundle at the Darrowshire town square.^Now, <name>, you will take part in battle of Darrowshire, and you will save Joseph Redpath. Place this relic bundle in the Darrowshire town square, and the spirits of Darrowshire will rise. Join their battle and assure that these two things come to pass: Davil must survive beyond the death of Horgus, and Redpath must survive to be corrupted, then defeated. After defeating the corrupted Redpath, his spirit will be saved. Speak with him, then return to his daughter Pamela.Searching for the Lost Satchel^16^Horde^Ragefire Chasm^Rahauro^Maur Grimtotem^Searching for the Lost Satchel^^^Search Ragefire Chasm for Maur Grimtotem's corpse and search it for any items of interest.^The troggs are not the only thing that interested Magatha in Ragefire Chasm. She has heard word that one of her servants, a Maur Grimtotem, found something peculiar while in the Chasm, but he never made it out to show her what. She'd like Maur's body found--if it still exists--and any signs of what he found while attempting to speak to the troggs. Return to Magatha any items of interest, and I'm sure she would be very generous in her reward. Again, seek the Chasm in the darkest areas of Orgrimmar.Testing an Enemy's Strength^15^Horde^Ragefire Chasm^Rahauro^Rahauro^^^^Search Orgrimmar for Ragefire Chasm, then kill 8 Ragefire Troggs and 8 Ragefire Shaman before returning to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff.^Beneath the city of Orgrimmar, stout creatures known as troggs started coming to the surface from deep below the lava filled tunnels. In her ever-benevolence, Magatha sought to make peace with the creatures, but they turned on her diplomats, killing them. She will not allow such treatment of the tauren people and now consider the creatures a threat to all of the Horde. She asks that you put an end to this trogg threat before it overwhelms the Horde from below. Find Ragefire Chasm and destroy them all.Returning the Lost Satchel^16^Horde^Ragefire Chasm^Maur Grimtotem^Rahauro^Searching for the Lost Satchel^^^Take the Grimtotem Satchel to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff.^You find a satchel under the body of the tauren. It is still gripped tightly in his arms as though he was trying to protect it while being attacked by the troggs. Removing the satchel from his vice-like grip, you stow it with your own equipment and prepare to make your way out of the tunnels and back to Rahauro in Thunder Bluff.Hidden Enemies^12^Horde^Orgrimmar^Thrall^Thrall^^^Hidden Enemies^Bring a Lieutenant's Insignia to Thrall in Orgrimmar.^One thing I will not tolerate are traitors in our midst, <name>. But I would be a fool to play my hand so early--it would not sufficiently cut the corruption out of our lands and only cause the infection to grow worse. But you, a young adventurer, could go places my agents could not... could learn the truth... could find the true head of the beast. If you are brave enough, then enter Skull Rock to the east of Orgrimmar, find a lieutenant's insignia off one of the Burning Blade there, and return to me.Hidden Enemies^12^Horde^Orgrimmar^Thrall^Thrall^Hidden Enemies^Hidden Enemies^^Take the Lieutenant's Insignia to Neeru Fireblade and speak to him. Gauge if he believes you are a member of the Burning Blade and then return to Thrall in Orgrimmar.^Now let us see if this insignia you found is worth the effort. There is a warlock within the city who believes he has my trust. He does not know that I realize where his true loyalties lie. He is in fact the leader of the Burning Blade. But do not rush off to do battle with him; he has a purpose, and we shall use him against our enemies. Take this insignia to him in the Cleft of Shadow here in Orgrimmar, speak to him and see if he believes you are one of his own, then return to me here.Hidden Enemies^16^Horde^Ragefire Chasm^Thrall^Thrall^Hidden Enemies^^^Kill Bazzalan and Jergosh the Invoker before returning to Thrall in Orgrimmar.^Hmm, leaders of the Searing Blade... this concerns me most. If they are the ones of value to Neeru, then those are who we must target first. This satyr... Bazzalan, and the other Neeru mentioned--what was he, a warlock?--must be slain. Return to the Cleft of Shadow and enter Ragefire Chasm, <name>. Find these two leaders of the Searing Blade, and kill them. But be careful not to let Neeru know it was you who did this. You must retain your identity as one of his <brothers/sisters> in arms.Hidden Enemies^15^Horde^Orgrimmar^Thrall^Neeru Fireblade^Hidden Enemies^^^Speak to Neeru Fireblade in Orgrimmar.^I think our next step should be to have you placed close to Neeru. If he is as agitated as reports suggest, then we may accomplish two things. One, you may be able to gain some greater knowledge about the Council or at least the Burning Blade, and two, he may just begin to trust you enough that he asks you to start to aid him. He may very well look at you as someone who can fill the void now that some of the leadership is in turmoil. Return to the Cleft and speak to him again, but do not be too overt.Hidden Enemies^16^Horde^Orgrimmar^Neeru Fireblade^Thrall^Hidden Enemies^^^Speak to Thrall in Orgrimmar and tell him what you've learned.^You are one of my lieutenants! Prepare yourself, <class>. I will call upon you soon. My time spent on the Searing Blade may be all but wasted now, but that does not mean that the Shadow Council's schemes elsewhere must suffer. I will do what I can to minimize the damage here in Ragefire Chasm. In the meantime, I will have my agents in the Barrens and Ashenvale begin work on our newest agenda. Return to me soon.Sceptre of Light^33^All^Desolace^Azore Aldamort^Azore Aldamort^Sceptre of Light^^^Get the Sceptre of Light and then return it to Azore Aldamort at the tower in Ethel Rethor.^The Burning Blade in Thunder Axe Fortress to the east is rumored to have acquired the Sceptre of Light from the Naga. Legend tells that the sceptre is able to sink entire cities under the great seas. The Burning Blade must not be allowed to possess such power. To that end, you must retrieve the sceptre yourself! It is held by a Burning Blade seer, who studies the sceptre from atop one of the Thunder Axe watchtowers.Redemption^56^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Tirion Fordring^Redemption^Demon Dogs^^Listen to what Tirion Fordring has to say.^You have worked hard, friend. Rest your weary bones and allow me to properly introduce myself.Slaying the Beast^16^All^Ragefire Chasm^Neeru Fireblade^Neeru Fireblade^^^^Enter Ragefire Chasm and slay Taragaman the Hungerer, then bring his heart back to Neeru Fireblade in Orgrimmar.^The primary task set upon me by our great Warchief is to root out the creatures responsible for infesting our lord's great city with demonic influence. The Burning Blade is one threat, but there are others; the Searing Blade for instance, who make their home in Ragefire Chasm, secretly attempting to subvert innocent members of the Horde. If they are to be stopped, then their leader must be slain--a Felguard named Taragaman the Hungerer. Kill him, and his heart will appease Thrall, of this I'm sure.Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^31^All^Thousand Needles^Kravel Koalbeard^Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^^^^Take Kravel's Crate to Hemet Nesingwary Jr. in Stranglethorn Vale.^I have a package for a new customer of mine, a dwarf named Hemet Nesingwary Jr.. The package took weeks to arrive, and Hemet's long gone by now. He said he was going to Stranglethorn to take his father's place and hunt the beasts there, but he left me some money to send his delivery when I could. Junior's a rich dwarf and it's a good idea to keep up relations with the rich ones, yeah? So... you want to deliver the package for me? I heard he has a camp in Stranglethorn, north of Grom'gol.Hunting in Stranglethorn^31^Horde^Desolace^Roon Wildmane^Hemet Nesingwary Jr.^^^^Bring Roon's Kodo Horn to Hemet Nesingwary Jr. in Stranglethorn Vale.^Long ago, a dwarf came to this land. His name was Hemet and he wished to hunt great beasts. His skills with the rifle were uncanny, and we spent many days hunting together. Even the enmity between our peoples was forgotten. When he left for Stranglethorn, I vowed to one day welcome him back. Now he has gone on to hunt in lands unknown, but his son has taken his place. Take this kodo horn as a gift to Hemet Jr.. You will find him in Stranglethorn, north of the Grom'gol Base camp.Of Forgotten Memories^57^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Tirion Fordring^Redemption^^^Travel to the Undercroft - at the southernmost section of the Eastern Plaguelands - and recover Taelan's Hammer. Return to Tirion Fordring upon completion of your objective.^To help Taelan regain what he has lost, you must gather items from his past. The first such item is a toy that I gave to him on his 7th birthday. It was his most cherished possession: A miniature war hammer; an exact replica of my very own. After I was banished for treason, his mother told him that I had died. He was taken to my false grave at the Undercroft, where he buried the hammer along with my memory - forever. You must venture to the Undercroft and recover Taelan's hammer.Fire Plume Forged^57^Alliance^Tanaris^Krinkle Goodsteel^Alchemist Arbington^Scholomance^^^Take the Skeleton Key Mold and 2 Thorium Bars to the top of Fire Plume Ridge in Un'Goro Crater. Use the Skeleton Key Mold by the lava lake to forge the Unfinished Skeleton Key.^You need two bars of thorium and a powerfully hot heat source to forge the key stem. You're on your own for the thorium, but I can help with the heat. To our west in Un'Goro Crater is Fire Plume Ridge - a simmering volcano. The lava lake up top is hot enough to fuse thorium and bone together. Your gold has bought you a mold that simply requires you to dip it in the lake up top; the lava will take care of the rest. That's it on my end. To finish your key, you'll need to talk to Arbington again.Fire Plume Forged^57^Horde^Tanaris^Krinkle Goodsteel^Apothecary Dithers^Scholomance^^^Take the Skeleton Key Mold and 2 Thorium Bars to the top of Fire Plume Ridge in Un'Goro Crater. Use the Skeleton Key Mold by the lava lake to forge the Unfinished Skeleton Key.^You need two bars of thorium and a powerfully hot heat source to forge the key stem. You're on your own for the thorium, but I can help with the heat. To our west in Un'Goro Crater is Fire Plume Ridge - a simmering volcano. The lava lake up top is hot enough to fuse thorium and bone together. Your gold has bought you a mold that simply requires you to dip it in the lake up top; the lava will take care of the rest. That's it on my end. To finish your key, you'll need to talk to Dithers again.Araj's Scarab^60^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Alchemist Arbington^Alchemist Arbington^Scholomance^^The Key to Scholomance^Destroy Araj the Summoner and bring Araj's Scarab to Alchemist Arbington at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands.^Araj the Summoner lords over Andorhal from the ruined city's heart. We know that he was the former leader of Scholomance before claiming the city as his own. To finish the key, we will need his signet - called a scarab - mounted as the head of the key. Make your way into the heart of Andorhal, and break his hold on the city now that he is drawn into the open. Once destroyed, seize his scarab from his fallen phylactery! The Key to Scholomance awaits, <name>!Araj's Scarab^60^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Apothecary Dithers^Apothecary Dithers^Scholomance^^The Key to Scholomance^Destroy Araj the Summoner and bring Araj's Scarab to Apothecary Dithers at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^Araj the Summoner lords over Andorhal from the ruined city's heart. We know that he was the former leader of Scholomance before claiming the city as his own. To finish the key, we will need his signet - called a scarab - mounted as the head of the key. Make your way into the heart of Andorhal, and break his hold on the city now that he is drawn into the open. Once destroyed, seize his scarab from his fallen phylactery! The Key to Scholomance awaits, <name>!Bodyguard for Hire^35^All^Desolace^Cork Gizelton^Smeed Scrabblescrew^^^^Escort the Gizelton Caravan past the Kolkar Centaur village. Talk with Smeed at Scrabblescrew's Camp for your reward.^Under normal circumstances, Rigger and I would lead our kodo past the Kolkar Centaur. Every now and then we hear the Centaur war drums, and when we hear those we stop. It's not good for business to be dead! I'll tell you what <class>, if you protect us past the Kolkar village we'll make it worth your while. It's just a short distance, all you need to do is keep the caravan intact and you can pick up your reward from Smeed Scrabblescrew - he is down the road a bit. We do a little business together.Of Lost Honor^58^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Tirion Fordring^Redemption^^^Travel to Northdale, in the northeastern region of the Eastern Plaguelands, and recover the Symbol of Lost Honor. Return to Tirion Fordring upon completion of your objective.^The Order of the Silver Hand was utterly decimated when Uther was slain. The boy held out for as long as he could. Pushed to the war torn hamlet of Northdale, he made his final stand. Were any of the Order left alive, he thought - and did it matter? It was with that thought that Taelan threw down the standard of the Order and renounced all that he had known. His honor left upon the blood soaked ground of Northdale. You must travel to Northdale and recover that symbol of lost honor.Of Love and Family^58^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Artist Renfray^Redemption^^^Travel to island of Caer Darrow, in the south-central region of the Plaguelands, and look for any clues as to the whereabouts of the painting.^When Taelan was a child, we would oft visit Caer Darrow on family excursions. On our last visit, an artist by the name of Renfray painted a portrait of us poised along the beachside. It is my fondest memory of both Taelan and Karandra. For it was at that moment, with my wife and son in my arms, that I felt a bond of love and family that I would never know again. If this painting still exists, you must find it. Travel to the ruined island of Caer Darrow and see if the painting or the artist remain.Of Love and Family^60^All^Stratholme^Artist Renfray^Tirion Fordring^Redemption^^^Travel to Stratholme, in the northern part of the Plaguelands. It is in the Scarlet Bastion that you will find the painting 'Of Love and Family,' hidden behind another painting depicting the twin moons of our world.^The painting... It hung on the wall of my workshop - inside the Order's barracks - for years. After Tirion's trial was over, I knew that I could no longer keep the painting visible. I hid it in a place that they would never think to look. Travel to Stratholme and make your way deep inside what is now the Scarlet Bastion, search for a painting of our twin moons. Chip away at the paint until you uncover my master work, 'Of Love and Family.' May the Light guide your actions.Find Myranda^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Tirion Fordring^Myranda the Hag^Redemption^^^Travel to Uther's Tomb, located in the southern Plaguelands. Show Myranda the Hag Tirion's Gift.^<name>, you have done all that I have asked thus far. Only one step remains in your quest of redemption. You must deliver the items you have collected to Taelan. Unfortunately, Taelan and his Scarlet Crusaders will attack you on sight. There is only one way in which to deliver my message and that is through a guise of deception. To the south you will find Uther's tomb. An old and trusted confidant of mine, Myranda, now resides there - seek her out. Show her the items and she will assist you.Scarlet Subterfuge^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Myranda the Hag^Highlord Taelan Fordring^Redemption^^In Dreams^Speak to Myranda to gain the Scarlet Illusion. Travel to Hearthglen while under the Scarlet Illusion and deliver Tirion's Gift to Highlord Taelan Fordring.^I am what you would call, an illusionist. Though I may be able to create an illusion to allow you entry into Hearthglen, be warned; my powers have their limitations. Should you travel too far from these lands, the effects of the illusion will cease. The spell itself takes a great amount of concentration and power from me, and thus, I can only sustain the effect for a short time. Speak to me again when you are ready.The Dunemaul Compound^49^All^Tanaris^Andi Lynn^Andi Lynn^^^^Andi Lynn in Gadgetzan wants you to destroy the Dunemaul Compound by killing 10 Dunemaul Brutes, 10 Dunemaul Enforcers, and Gor'marok the Ravager.^Just recently, a large band of nomadic ogres arrived in Tanaris. South of here, they have taken over a large area of the desert and formed a compound. Several smaller bands are currently wandering the desert, some of which have invaded the old troll ruins. The Dunemaul Compound must be destroyed! We cannot allow these ogres to build up a force. The leader of this band is named Gor'marok the Ravager; I believe that putting an end to his leadership will be the beginning of the end for the ogres.Irondeep Supplies^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Stormpike Quartermaster^Stormpike Quartermaster^^^^Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Alliance Quartermaster in Dun Baldar.^Before the fighting started, we stored supplies for Dun Baldar in the Irondeep mine. The troggs that surfaced there weren't much of a problem when we had spare troops to guard the mine, but now that we're fighting with the Horde we can't maintain control of Irondeep. We need the supplies in Irondeep, <name>. Enter the mine and bring me a load of them.Coldtooth Supplies^51^Horde^Alterac Valley^Frostwolf Quartermaster^Frostwolf Quartermaster^^^^Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Horde Quatermaster in Frostwolf Keep.^The Coldtooth mine to the north was once an ideal place to store extra supplies, but now that the fighting with the Stormpikes grows fierce, we do not always have the spare warriors to station at the mine and protect it. And so, control of the mine often falls to the Alliance, or to underground denizens... But we still need our supplies, <name>! Go to the Coldtooth mine and bring me a load of them. And be wary of enemies as you go; the tides of battle shift quickly in that place...A Plague Upon Thee^55^Horde^Eastern Plaguelands^Mickey Levine^Mickey Levine^A Plague Upon Thee^^^Use the Empty Termite Jar on the Termite Mounds in Eastern Plaguelands. After you've gathered 100 Plagueland Termites, return to Mickey Levine at the Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades.^So, to bring pain and strife to the Scarlet Crusade, I want to take their precious lumber mill from them. I'm sure the loss of such a resource will cause them a great deal of harm in defending and rebuilding the town for their own reasons. Will you help me, <name>? Start by taking this jar to Plaguewood in the Eastern Plaguelands. Fill it with the termites you find in their mounds throughout the woods. Come back when you have enough.A Plague Upon Thee^55^Horde^Tirisfal Glades^Mickey Levine^Termite Barrel^A Plague Upon Thee^^^Find someplace suitable in the center of the Northridge Lumber Mill in Western Plaguelands to place the Barrel of Plagueland Termites.^Now that we have plenty of termites, take this steel reinforced barrel to the Northridge Lumber Mill south of Hearthglen--you'll find it to the west of the road that leads you up to the town. Once there, place the barrel in the center of the lumber mill; someplace high, like on a crate or something. After you open it, the rest should take care of itself. Just come back here and I'll reward you for helping me.A Plague Upon Thee^55^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^Nathaniel Dumah^Nathaniel Dumah^A Plague Upon Thee^^^Use the Empty Termite Jar on the Termite Mounds in Eastern Plaguelands. After you've gathered 100 Plagueland Termites, return to Nathaniel Dumah at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands.^I've tried many times to rout out the Scarlet Crusade through force alone, but to no avail. So, as an alternative, I've decided to make their lives more difficult. If you are willing to help, I want to infest that lumber mill with the most terrible species of termites ever found. In Plaguewood, near the once-great Stratholme, there is a breed that survived the plague and the Scourge combined. Find their mounds and fill this jar with them, so we can prepare them to be unleashed on the Crusade.A Plague Upon Thee^55^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Nathaniel Dumah^Termite Barrel^A Plague Upon Thee^^^Find someplace suitable in the center of the Northridge Lumber Mill in Western Plaguelands to place the Barrel of Plagueland Termites.^Now that we have the termites, take this steel reinforced barrel to the Northridge Lumber Mill south of Hearthglen--you'll find it to the west of the road that leads you up to the town. Once there, place the barrel in the center of the lumber mill; find someplace suitable, like on a crate and then open it. The termites should do their work from there and make the mill useless to the Crusade.Moonglade^10^Night Elf^Druid^Mathrengyl Bearwalker^Dendrite Starblaze^Heeding the Call^^Great Bear Spirit^Use the spell "Teleport: Moonglade" to travel to Moonglade. When you arrive, speak with Dendrite Starblaze in the village of Nighthaven.^All druids are welcome in the sacred lands of Moonglade, regardless of the current tensions in the Cenarion Circle between Arch Druid Staghelm and Keeper Remulos - Moonglade's guardian.

When finished, return to Dendrite Starblaze in Nighthaven, Moonglade.^In the northwest part of Moonglade resides the home of a wise and noble being we call the Great Bear Spirit.

We shall meet again.Return to Chromie^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Carlin Redpath^Chromie^Marauders of Darrowshire^^^Take the Bundle of Relics to Chromie in Andorhal.^You have gathered many relics of the battle of Darrowshire. Each time you returned with more, my heart yearned for my village... yearned to protect it from its fate. I know that cannot be, but Chromie, that strange gnome in Andorhal, tells me it is possible. She says you can save Darrowshire! She asked me to gather together the relics, and to have you bring them to her. She said that she awaits you in the ruined inn of Andorhal.Hidden Treasures^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Pamela Redpath^Joseph's Chest^Marauders of Darrowshire^^^Bring Joseph's Key to Joseph's Chest.^Daddy told me to give you this key. He said it opens a chest out back behind the house. He also wanted me to thank you. Did you do a favor for him? Did you tell him you found my doll? Well here's the key. And thank you <name>. Thank you! You're a very nice <man/lady>!Gizelton Caravan^38^All^Desolace^Rigger Gizelton^Smeed Scrabblescrew^^^^Escort the Gizelton Caravan through Mannoroc Coven. Talk with Smeed at Scrabblescrew's Camp for your reward.^You look like a capable <race>. Perhaps you're looking to make some money? Cork and I started this caravan to make a bundle of money; little did we know the dangers of turning a buck! Up ahead is Mannoroc Coven... normally the demons ignore us but something has the kodos spooked this time. I'll pay you to protect the caravan past Mannoroc Coven. Once we are safely past you can receive your reward from our business associate Smeed at Scrabblescrew's Camp.In Dreams^60^All^Western Plaguelands^Highlord Taelan Fordring^Tirion Fordring^^Scarlet Subterfuge^^Escort Taelan Fordring out of Hearthglen.^For so long, I have been a puppet of the Grand Crusader. What reason was there to fight against what the Scarlet Crusade had become? It has been decades, yet the memories of my father; those precious memories, they are what have kept me alive. I have dreams, stranger. In these dreams my father is with me. He stands proudly at my side as I am inducted into the Order. We battle legion of Scourge, side by side. We bring honor to the Alliance, to Lordaeron. I want not to dream anymore. Take me to him.The Champion of the Banshee Queen^56^Horde^Undercity^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Nathanos Blightcaller^^^^Speak with Nathanos Blightcaller in the Eastern Plaguelands. He is said to have taken up residence at the Marris Stead.^It pleases me greatly to see the battle hardened join our cause. Our numbers grow in size and strength as each day passes. Perhaps you are prepared to test your mettle, <class>? Among the first of my champions was Nathanos, now known as the Blightcaller. Few exist with more dedication or vigor amidst our ranks. Seek him out in the Eastern Plaguelands. He resides at the Marris Stead; occasionally roaming the decimated wastes, slaying all Scourge and Alliance filth that cross his path.Rampaging Giants^60^Alliance^Winterspring^Rivern Frostwind^Rivern Frostwind^^^^Rivern Frostwind wants you to kill 4 Frostmaul Giants and 4 Frostmaul Preservers.^Around 4,000 years ago, Tyrande Whisperwind saved the life of the frostsaber queen, at the hands of rampaging giants. Since then, the frostsabers have been allies of the night elves. These same giants that once were a danger to the frostsabers, still exist not too far from here. They are called the frostmaul, and they have taken over the large valley to the south. Prove your loyalty to the frostsabers; kill these giants in the name of the frostsaber queen, Shy-Rotam!Body and Heart^10^Night Elf^Druid^Mathrengyl Bearwalker^Mathrengyl Bearwalker^Heeding the Call^^^Use the Cenarion Moondust on the Moonkin Stone of Auberdine to bring forth Lunaclaw. From there, you must face Lunaclaw and earn the strength of body and heart it possesses.^Directly east of Auberdine lay many moonkin caves. The one closest to Auberdine has a Moonkin Stone inside it. Lunaclaw, the defender of the stone, will face you only when Cenarion Moondust is applied to it. Lunaclaw possesses within it a strength that you must use as one of the Claw. You've earned the right to use this Cenarion Moondust, <name>... now show me that you've earned the right to possess the strength of body and the strength of heart needed as a druid!Body and Heart^10^Tauren^Druid^Turak Runetotem^Turak Runetotem^Heeding the Call^^^Use the Cenarion Lunardust on the Moonkin Stone between Mulgore and the Barrens to bring forth Lunaclaw. From there, you must face Lunaclaw and earn the strength of body and heart it possesses.^On land west of Taurajo in the Barrens - just before it turns into Mulgore - lies a Moonkin Stone. The moonkin are special beasts, not native to these parts. Lunaclaw, the stone's defender, will face you when Cenarion Lunardust is applied to it. Lunaclaw possesses within it a strength that you must use as one of the Claw. You've earned the right to use this Cenarion Lunardust, <name>... now show me that you've earned the right to possess the strength of body and the strength of heart needed as a druid!Unfinished Business^56^All^Western Plaguelands^Kirsta Deepshadow^Kirsta Deepshadow^Unfinished Business^^^Kill 2 Scarlet Medics, 2 Scarlet Hunters, 2 Scarlet Magi and 2 Scarlet Knights before returning to Kirsta Deepshadow in Western Plaguelands.^I was sent as a scout to do some damage and gauge the strength of Hearthglen's defenses. Some people in the Alliance feel the little town has more than historical importance. It's not my job to question what that importance is, but regardless, I'm in no shape to continue until I rest up. If you're willing, I'd pay handsomely for some help. Start south of here at their camp near the small bulwark they've set up. If you prove strong enough, maybe I could get your help with my main goal.Zaeldarr the Outcast^55^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Caretaker Alen^Caretaker Alen^^^^Bring Zaeldarr's Head to Caretaker Alen at Light's Hope Chapel.^Can you believe that, after all the trouble we have in the plaguelands... we have to worry about thieves too? And not just normal thieves, troll thieves. And not just normal troll thieves. Dead troll thieves! They're led by this big, dead troll named Zaeldarr the Outcast, and they come here at night and steal bodies from the pit below, then take them back to their evil, dead troll hideout--the Undercroft to the west. Go there and take out Zaeldarr, <name>. I'm sick to death of his mischief!To Kill With Purpose^58^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Nathanos Blightcaller^Nathanos Blightcaller^^^^Travel to Corin's Crossing to the east and slaughter the Scourge that inhabit the town. Collect 7 pieces of Living Rot in under 10 minutes. Use the Mortar and Pestle to grind the Living Rot into Coagulated Rot.^You kill with purpose while you remain on my stead. Your first task is to feed my hounds. Take this mortar and pestle and travel to Corin's Crossing. Once there, you will find a robust selection of Scourge to slaughter. From their fresh carcasses I need living rot. Take that living rot and grind it up in the mortar, then let it sit to coagulate. Bring the coagulated rot back here. And imbecile, realize that living rot from the undead doesn't remain 'living' for very long. You must kill quickly!Unfinished Business^57^All^Western Plaguelands^Kirsta Deepshadow^Kirsta Deepshadow^Unfinished Business^^^Kill Huntsman Radley and Cavalier Durgen before returning to Kirsta Deepshadow in Western Plaguelands.^My real mission was to weaken the Scarlet Crusade's outlying forces and then infiltrate Hearthglen to gauge their numbers. I'm still in no shape to do it on my own, so perhaps I could ask you to aid me again, <name>? From what information I gathered before being discovered, the Crusade has two important members that are the backbone of their forces outside the town: Huntsman Radley and Cavalier Durgen. Kill them, and we're making progress. They should be along Hearthglen Pass outside the town proper.Hameya's Plea^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Torn Scroll^Mound of Dirt^^^^Kill Infiltrator Hameya. Use his key on the Mound of Dirt behind the Undercroft.^Kill me. Before it's too late. I am Hameya. While traveling to Zul'Mashar, my brethren and I ate some bad meat... and we changed. We are infected. I can feel the lich's words now, urging me to reach Zul'Mashar and infect more of my people. I cannot resist, and so I wrote this scroll before my will left me. I buried a chest in dirt next to a wagon behind this crypt, but only my key will open it. I have the key. If you want my treasure, then find me. Kill me. Before it's too late.Unfinished Business^58^All^Western Plaguelands^Kirsta Deepshadow^Kirsta Deepshadow^Unfinished Business^^^Enter Hearthglen and find a high vantage point from which you can see the town and gauge the Scarlet Crusade's forces, then return to Kirsta Deepshadow in Western Plaguelands.^What? Really? You want to know more? But you've already done so much for me, <name>. I couldn't possibly ask you to enter Hearthglen itself on my behalf. Are you sure, <name>? Hearthglen is much more dangerous than the Pass--I cannot provide you any protection or even information about what you might face. Well, if you really are willing to help, then enter the town and find a high place to gain a good view of the town. From there you can gauge their numbers and report them back to me. But be careful....That's Asking A Lot^58^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Smokey LaRue^Smokey LaRue^That's Asking A Lot^^^Smokey LaRue wants you to get 2 Thorium Bars, 1 Golden Rod, 8 Hi-Explosive Bombs, and 8 Unstable Triggers.^These here Argent Dawn people commissioned ol' Smokey to do a little demolition work for 'em. Smokey's mammy ain't raised no dummy. When gold coin is slapped on the table, Smokey's services are available. That's my motto! Now I'd be willing to split the commission with you if you're willing to do a little legwork. Here's the deal: I'm going to head over to Plaguewood and mark the buildings we need destroyed. You gather the components for the bombs. Meet back here when you've got everything. Deal?Book of the Ancients^38^All^Desolace^Azore Aldamort^Azore Aldamort^Sceptre of Light^^^Get the Book of the Ancients and return it to Azore Aldamort at the tower in Ethel Rethor.^<name>, I entrust you with the Gem of the Serpent. Place this gem on the Serpent Statue's hand on Ranazjar Isle, a small island northwest of here. Placing it will summon the one who protects the Book of the Ancients. This book contains the secrets of the naga, secrets that have been kept for centuries. Bring this book to me, and we will learn much about our scaled foes!The Everlook Report^52^Alliance^Winterspring^Gregor Greystone^Argent Officer Pureheart^^^^Deliver the Everlook Report to Argent Officer Pureheart at Chillwind Camp, Western Plaguelands.^I am looking for a responsible individual to aid me in a small but nonetheless important matter. I'm here as a representative of the Argent Dawn's interests to the local governance of Everlook. I need to get a progress report to Argent Officer Pureheart at Chillwind Camp; it's a ways from here, located along the southern fringe of the Western Plaguelands. If I may be so bold - this would be a perfect means to introduce yourself to my superior and perhaps earn some work from her!The Everlook Report^52^Horde^Winterspring^Gregor Greystone^Argent Officer Garush^^^^Deliver the Everlook Report to Argent Officer Garush at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.^I'm looking for a responsible individual to aid me in a small but nonetheless important matter. I'm here as a representative of the Argent Dawn's interests to the local governance of Everlook. I need to get a progress report to Argent Officer Garush at the Bulwark; it's a ways from here, located along the western fringe of the Western Plaguelands, east of Tirisfal Glades. If I may be so bold - this would be a perfect means to introduce yourself to my superior and perhaps earn some work from him!Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^52^All^Winterspring^Gregor Greystone^Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff^^^^Deliver the book, "Studies in Spirit Speaking", to Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff at Light's Hope Chapel, Eastern Plaguelands.^A recluse medium found in these parts by the name of Umbranse has provided the Argent Dawn with quite a literary masterpiece... one that amounts to quite possibly the largest collection of jibber-jabber I've ever seen written. One of the Dawn's most respected leaders, Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff, is a brilliant linguist. Could you take this to him for me - for a reward, of course? Light's Hope Chapel - that's where he's currently at, far in the eastern part of the Eastern Plaguelands.Runecloth^55^All^Felwood^Meilosh^Meilosh^^^^Bring 30 Runecloth to Meilosh in Timbermaw Hold.^In Timbermaw, we are content. We do not like strangers. This is good for us, but it is bad for trade. Not long ago, a rare night elf friend came to Timbermaw and she wore a runecloth cloak. Runecloth is rare among us, but the cloak was so fine my people want me to make more runecloth clothing. Will you bring me runecloth? If you bring me enough, then I will give you something in trade.Sacred Cloth^55^All^Felwood^Meilosh^Meilosh^^^^Bring 2 Mooncloth to Meilosh in Timbermaw Hold.^Although the people of Timbermaw delight in the feel of runecloth, it is not sacred to us. But mooncloth is sacred. Bring me a small supply of this holy cloth, and I will teach you a secret fashioning technique.When Smokey Sings, I Get Violent^58^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Smokey LaRue^Smokey LaRue^That's Asking A Lot^^^Travel to Plaguewood, northwest of Light's Hope. Destroy 8 Scourge Structures by using Smokey's Special Compound at the Mark of Detonation planted inside each building. Smokey has had the Ziggurats and Slaughterhouses marked.^While you were gathering the supplies, I had some of my people handle marking the Scourge buildings we need demolished. Here's the plan: I'm going to give you ten sticks of my special compound. You're going to take them over to Plaguewood and plant them inside the Scourge structures that I've had marked for detonation. <Smokey snaps his fingers.> Bing! It's just that easy.Un-Life's Little Annoyances^58^Horde^Eastern Plaguelands^Nathanos Blightcaller^Nathanos Blightcaller^^^^Slay 20 Noxious Plaguebats and 10 Monstrous Plaguebats. Return to Nathanos Blightcaller when you are finished.^You cannot take two steps off of this farm without running into one of those obnoxious bats. I want to be able to take the hounds out and slaughter Scourge without being accosted by any damned, dirty bats. Obviously, I have better things to do with my time than mindlessly kill bats day in and day out. You, however, do not. What? Your training? This is your training! Now get out of my sight and don't come back until you've killed a fair number of those winged demons.

Kill the Courier and recover the Grand Crusader's Command.^Just as the body cannot survive without the head, the head cannot survive without the body. The defenses of the Scarlet Crusade's command inside Stratholme are almost impenetrable. We must, instead, cut the body out from under the head. My Deathstalkers have been collecting data on the activity of the Crusade outside of Stratholme. Each day, a report is sent from their central command to Tyr's Hand. This report is the key, <race>!

Return to Nathanos Blightcaller should you succeed.^Demetria is chief advisor to the Grand Crusader. She is called the Oracle due to her 'otherworldly' senses. She has successfully assisted the Crusade in several of their victories against the Scourge. While this ruse was successful in exposing her, if she truly does possess psychic powers, she will undoubtedly be expecting some sort of trouble. You are going to provide that 'trouble.'

Make me proud, worm.Claim Rackmore's Treasure!^36^All^Desolace^Rackmore's Log^Rackmore's Chest^^^^Find Rackmore's Silver Key. Find Rackmore's Golden Key.

I want this Ror's clawed hand, <name>. I want it to pay for leaving me a widow! I believe the creature is to the south... near the Ashenvale border.Ramstein^60^Horde^Stratholme^Nathanos Blightcaller^Nathanos Blightcaller^^Duskwing, Oh How I Hate Thee...^^Travel to Stratholme and slay Ramstein the Gorger. Take his head as a souvenir for Nathanos.^I was overwhelmed. On this very stead, I stood... held my ground in defense of Lordaeron. The farm and all on it were waylaid by a gigantic wave of Scourge. The wretch. The filth. It hovered above me, entrails hanging from its gaping chest cavity. I woke as Scourge. For so long I was helpless. My mind had coalesced with the Lich King's. She came for me... somewhere, somehow, I knew she would. Free. And now, I must have my vengeance - my vengeance on that which took from me my life. Destroy it.Augustus' Receipt Book^55^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Augustus the Touched^Augustus the Touched^^^^Get Augustus' Receipt Book from the inn in Terrordale.^I'm ready for business! What you do want? Oh wait... I can't open up shop without my receipt book. How am I to keep track of things without my receipt book? I must have left it in town somewhere. I had a room in the inn... the book must be there. Bring me my book. Please, bring it to me! Bring me my book and you'll see! I'll set up shop and you'll see that my prices are INSANE!A Swift Message^10^Human^Westfall^Quartermaster Lewis^Thor^A Swift Message^^^Bring Lewis' Note to Thor the gryphon master.^Although we don't get much aid from Stormwind directly, I do have a contact in the city who helps supply us with armor. His name is Osric Strang. His shop, Limited Immunity, is in the Old Town of Stormwind. Our supply of armor dwindles, and I must contact Osric for more. Can you take him this note? The fastest way to Stormwind is through Thor, our gryphon master. He's just down the hill; bring him my note, and then take a gryphon to Stormwind.The First and the Last^60^Alliance^Stormwind City^Highlord Bolvar Fordragon^Master Mathias Shaw^The First and the Last^^^Speak with Mathias Shaw in Old Town Stormwind. He resides in the Barracks.^Nathanos Marris was the first and last of the human ranger lords. A disciple of Sylvanas Windrunner, now the Banshee Queen of the Forsaken. We had thought that Nathanos had been killed in action in the defense of Lordaeron five years ago. Although his corpse was never recovered, it was assumed that he did not make it out of the Eastern Plaguelands. Mathias Shaw has been investigating the disappearance and may have some new information. Report to him at once. He resides in Old Town, at the Barracks.Honor the Dead^60^Alliance^Stormwind City^Master Mathias Shaw^Master Mathias Shaw^The First and the Last^^^Speak with Mathias Shaw again if you wish to accept his task.^Five of my best field agents were assigned the Marris case. One returned, only to end up dead in his sleep three days later. What little information we did manage to get out of him was incoherent gibberish. We made out two words: "Nathanos," and "Blightcaller." I do not have the available manpower to continue this investigation and Ravenholdt will not assist us. We must get to the bottom of this; if only to provide closure to the families of the deceased. Will you help?Flint Shadowmore^60^Alliance^Western Plaguelands^Master Mathias Shaw^Flint Shadowmore^The First and the Last^^^Travel to Chillwind Camp in the Western Plaguelands and meet up with your contact, Flint Shadowmore.^The only information we have thus far, then, is that Nathanos Marris may have been slain by this Blightcaller. We assume the Blightcaller is the same fiend that disposed of my agents. Flint Shadowmore, another SI:7 operative, is stationed at the Alliance encampment of Chillwind Point in the Western Plaguelands. Seek him out; he will debrief you on the current situation in the Plagues and give you an assignment. Good luck, <name>.The Eastern Plagues^60^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^Flint Shadowmore^Flint Shadowmore^The First and the Last^^^Scour the Eastern Plaguelands for clues as to the "Blightcaller" and the missing SI:7 agents. If you find any SI:7 Insignias, return them to Flint Shadowmore at Chillwind Camp.^As I said, your first mission is one of reconnaissance. Nothing fancy, <name>. You must travel to the Eastern Plaguelands and look for any clues as to this Blightcaller. Be on the lookout for information about our missing operatives. We have to assume that they are dead and if they are dead, they must have a corpse... somewhere. <Flint swallows hard.> All SI:7 agents carry this insignia. <Flint shows you his SI:7 insignia.> Bring any of those that you may find back to me.The Blightcaller Cometh^60^Alliance^Stormwind City^Flint Shadowmore^King Varian Wrynn^The First and the Last^^^Return to Stormwind and inform King Varian Wrynn of the fate of Nathanos Marris.^<The blood appears to have completely drained from Flint's face.> Na... Nathanos did this? Nathanos is the Blightcaller? Why? He was... was so noble - a ranger lord respected by all. The only human ever allowed to train under the high elves. Now a ruthless agent of the Forsaken? I... I am sorry to ask this of you, <name>, but King Wrynn must be informed of this turn of events at once. Please, return to Stormwind and deliver the news.Order Must Be Restored^60^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^King Varian Wrynn^King Varian Wrynn^The First and the Last^^^Assemble an army and travel to the Eastern Plaguelands. Launch a full assault on Nathanos Blightcaller and any Horde filth that may attempt to protect him.^Do you know how many ranger lords exist in this world? How many human ranger lords have ever existed? Nathanos' accomplishments were unprecedented. He was a tactical genius, responsible for Alliance victories spanning a decade of conflict. And now... the champion of the Forsaken. No. This cannot be. Order must be restored. Gather an army, <name>. Return to the Plagues with your army and destroy the Blightcaller. I wish you luck, <name>. Truly, you will need it for this battle.Dungar Longdrink^10^Human^Westfall^Osric Strang^Dungar Longdrink^A Swift Message^^^Bring Osric's Crate to Dungar Longdrink the gryphon master.^<name>, I gathered into this crate everything Lewis asked for. Can you take it to him? If you've already spoken to Thor in Westfall, then you can take a gryphon back to him. Dungar Longdrink is our gryphon master, over in the trade district. Speak with Dungar, then get this crate to Lewis as fast as you can. We don't want our fighting men and women in Westfall to go without fresh equipment!Continue to Stormwind^10^Human^Westfall^Thor^Osric Strang^A Swift Message^^^Buy a gryphon ride from the gryphon master Thor, then bring Lewis' Note to Osric Strang, in the shop Limited Immunity, in the Old Town of Stormwind.^For a small fee, you can take a gryphon to Stormwind, so you can deliver Lewis' note to Osric. You won't get there faster any other way. If that sounds acceptable, then just speak to me again when you're ready for the ride. I'll charge you a little, but trust me; it'll be worth it!Harpies Threaten^26^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Maggran Earthbinder^Maggran Earthbinder^Harpies Threaten^^^Maggran Earthbinder in Sun Rock Retreat wants you to slay 7 Bloodfury Harpies, 7 Bloodfury Ambushers, 7 Bloodfury Slayers and 7 Bloodfury Roguefeathers.^Tauren take pride as the protector of these lands. Undoubtedly you can guess why I am alarmed with the number of harpies that dwell here in Stonetalon. The Bloodfuries are the source of the increasing number of harpies in Kalimdor; they encroach upon all likes of life preventing the innocent from leaving their boundaries. I need you to cull the harpies, <name>!Bloodfury Bloodline^26^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Maggran Earthbinder^Maggran Earthbinder^Harpies Threaten^^^Maggran at Sun Rock Retreat wishes you to slay Bloodfury Ripper and bring her remains as proof of your deed.^Limiting the number of Bloodfury Harpies will not be enough. The only true cure for their disease would be to slay their leader, Bloodfury Ripper! She is all but a queen to those filthy creatures. Slay her and their numbers will surely diminish. Go back into the Charred Vale and you will find her along the western hills. She will not be easy to vanquish, but the reward will be great.Arachnophobia^21^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Wanted Poster: Besseleth^Maggran Earthbinder^^^^Kill Besseleth and bring Besseleth's Fang to Maggran at Sun Rock Retreat.^Warning: Proceed into Sishir Canyon west of here at your own risk. Besseleth and her eight-legged children of the forest have claimed this canyon as their webbed lair. Maggran Earthbinder in Sun Rock Retreat has placed a bounty on Besseleth. Slay her and bring proof of your killing to Maggran; there you will receive your reward for disposing this eight-legged menace.Return to Lewis^10^Human^Westfall^Dungar Longdrink^Quartermaster Lewis^A Swift Message^^^Buy a gryphon ride to Sentinel Hill from the gryphon master Dungar Longdrink, then take Osric's Crate to Lewis at Sentinel Hill.^The gryphon master in Westfall is Thor. If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him. That's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there. You've already been to Thor, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to Westfall. Once there, you can deliver Osric's Crate to Quartermaster Lewis.Cycle of Rebirth^23^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Tammra Windfield^Tammra Windfield^^^New Life^Tammra Windfield at Sun Rock Retreat wants you to gather 10 Gaea Seeds.^Industrial greed and continuous war have wrecked the lands of Stonetalon. Only the blessings of the Earthmother can cure such injury. <name>, I will require you to seek a special seed, the Gaea seed. They are only found here in Stonetalon Mountain, north of Sun Rock Retreat at Mirkfallon Lake, near the water's edge. Once you bring me the seeds I will imbue them with shamanistic power to speed their growth.Supplying the Sepulcher^10^Undead^Silverpine Forest^Deathguard Podrig^Karos Razok^Supplying the Sepulcher^^^Bring Podrig's Order to Karos Razok.^Executor Hadrec asked me to take stock of our equipment at the Sepulcher. With the Scourge, and worse, lurking in the woods, he doesn't want the Deathguards to lack gear they might need. I found that we are, in general, well stocked, but we do need more weapons to replace those lost in the field. Here is a requisition order of what is needed, for the weapon dealer Gordon Wendham in the Undercity. Take the order to our bat master, Karos Razok, and speak with him about transport to the Undercity.Michael Garrett^10^Undead^Silverpine Forest^Gordon Wendham^Michael Garrett^Supplying the Sepulcher^^^Bring Gordon's Crate to Michael Garrett.^I have placed the Sepulcher's supplies into this crate. If you have already visited the Sepulcher and spoken with their bat master, then you may ride a bat back to him. Speak with the Undercity's bat master, Michael Garrett. He can provide you with a bat to the Sepulcher.Ride to the Undercity^10^Undead^Silverpine Forest^Karos Razok^Gordon Wendham^Supplying the Sepulcher^^^Buy a bat ride to the Undercity from the bat master Karos Razok, then take Podrig's Order to Gordon Wendham in the Undercity.^One of my bats can take you to the Undercity, for a small fee. Speak with me again when you are ready so that we may arrange your transport. You will find Gordon Wendham in the Trade Quarter of the Undercity. That is the same quarter where my bat will land.Return to Podrig^10^Undead^Silverpine Forest^Michael Garrett^Deathguard Podrig^Supplying the Sepulcher^^^Buy a bat ride to the Sepulcher from the bat master Michael Garrett, then bring Gordon's Crate to Deathguard Podrig in the Sepulcher.^The bat master in the Sepulcher is Karos Razok. If you have already met him, then I can give you a bat to fly back to him. Our bats will always fly to the Undercity, but to travel to more remote locales their rider must first visit the area and speak with its bat master. You have met Karos in the Sepulcher, so you may now fly bats there. Speak with me again when you are ready.The Bounty of Teldrassil^10^Night Elf^Darkshore^Nessa Shadowsong^Vesprystus^Nessa Shadowsong^^^Bring Nessa's Collection to Vesprystus.^The fishermen of Rut'theran village do very well, for the fish here are extremely large and abundant. I would like to compare the bounty here with that of the mainland. I have a collection of fish bones and scales that I would like taken to a colleague of mine in Darkshore. His name is Laird, he is a fish vendor in the village of Auberdine. Bring my collection to our hippogryph master, Vesprystus, and speak to him about traveling to Auberdine.Flight to Auberdine^10^Night Elf^Darkshore^Vesprystus^Laird^Nessa Shadowsong^^^Ride a hippogryph to Auberdine from the hippogryph master Vesprystus, then bring Nessa's Collection to Laird.^From Rut'theran, there are two methods of travel to Auberdine: by ferry and by hippogryph. Both are quick and reliable, but if you have not yet flown to Auberdine by hippogryph, then I suggest you do. It is sound advice to speak with the hippogryph master in every town that has one. Once you speak to the master, you can then fly there from other towns. Here is Nessa's collection. Speak with me again when you are ready to fly to Auberdine and deliver Nessa's collection to Laird.Return to Nessa^10^Night Elf^Darkshore^Laird^Nessa Shadowsong^Nessa Shadowsong^^^Bring Laird's Response to Nessa Shadowsong.^I must send a response to Nessa. She'll be very interested to know how different the fish here are from those along Teldrassil's coastline. We can only guess the cause, but it is my suspicion that the world tree itself is affecting the wildlife around it! Please, take this response to Nessa. If you wish to take a hippogryph back to Rut'theran then speak with the hippogryph master Caylais Moonfeather. If you wish to take the ferry, then one regularly departs from the dock to the northwest.Nessa Shadowsong^10^Night Elf^Darnassus^Mydrannul^Nessa Shadowsong^Nessa Shadowsong^^^Speak with Nessa Shadowsong.^A friend of mine, Nessa Shadowsong, is a fishing merchant in Rut'theran Village. She needs a parcel taken to Darkshore, and is looking for someone to help her. If you're interested, then to reach Nessa you must take the portal in Darnassus to Rut'theran Village. You will find the portal west of the Temple Gardens.A Bundle of Hides^10^Tauren^The Barrens^Jahan Hawkwing^Devrak^A Bundle of Hides^^^Bring the Bundle of Hides to the wind rider master Devrak in the Crossroads.^I have a bundle of hides from the animals of the Barrens, and must get them to Thunder Bluff. A colleague there, Ahanu, will use the hides to create leather goods. Will you take the hides to him for me? The quickest way to Thunder Bluff is on the back of a wind rider. Bring the bundle of hides to Devrak, our wind rider master in the Crossroads, and speak to him about transport to Thunder Bluff.Ride to Thunder Bluff^10^Tauren^The Barrens^Devrak^Ahanu^A Bundle of Hides^^^Buy a wind rider to Thunder Bluff from the wind rider master Devrak, then bring the Bundle of Hides to Ahanu in Thunder Bluff.^For a small fee, I will give you a wind rider to Thunder Bluff. There's no faster way to the city! If that is acceptable, speak to me again when you are ready to go. If you're taking those hides to Ahanu, then I think he's at Hewa's Armory, at the base of the wind rider tower in Thunder Bluff. And that's right where you'll land!Tal the Wind Rider Master^10^Tauren^The Barrens^Ahanu^Tal^A Bundle of Hides^^^Bring Ahanu's Leather Goods to Tal in Thunder Bluff.^I have prepared leather goods for Jahan to sell at the Crossroads. Will you bring them to him? If you have already been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master, then you can fly one of our Thunder Bluff wind riders back to him.

You have been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master Devrak, so for a small fee you can take a wind rider to him from here. Speak with me again when you are ready. Once at the Crossroads, you can then deliver the leather goods to Jahan Hawkwing.Meats to Orgrimmar^10^Orc, Troll^The Barrens^Zargh^Devrak^Meats to Orgrimmar^^^Bring Zargh's Meats to Devrak in the Crossroads.^I have some choice cuts of meat that I want to send to a friend. Her name is Gryshka, the innkeeper in Orgrimmar. Will you deliver the meat for me? The fastest way to Orgrimmar is on a wind rider. Take the meats to the Crossroads wind rider master, Devrak, and speak with him about transport to Orgrimmar.New Life^25^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Tammra Windfield^Tammra Windfield^^Cycle of Rebirth^^Plant 10 Gaea Seeds in Gaea Dirt Mounds, and then return the remaining Enchanted Gaea Seeds to Tammra at Sun Rock Retreat.^As you have seen, <class>, though the land is in pain, the cycle of life is a powerful thing. Now we must do our part help it along. You must plant these seeds at the center of the destruction, to the west, in the Charred Vale. Beware, for harpies and angry fire elementals still plague the scarred land. <name>, take these enchanted Gaea seeds and plant them in fertile mounds of soil. The cycle of life must go on!The Ashenvale Hunt^20^Horde^The Barrens^Jorn Skyseer^Senani Thunderheart^^Ishamuhale^^Speak with Senani Thunderheart at Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.^Your strength impresses me, <class>. Your willingness to embrace the hunt gives me confidence that you could move on to bigger game... and bigger challenges. The forests of Ashenvale represent a vast untamed wild that the Horde seeks to impose its own will upon, both politically and spiritually. If you seek to prove yourself in an unproven land, seek the guidance of Senani Thunderheart in Splintertree Post. The outpost is due north of the path leading from the Barrens.Ride to Orgrimmar^10^Orc, Troll^The Barrens^Devrak^Innkeeper Gryshka^Meats to Orgrimmar^^^Buy a wind rider to Orgrimmar from the wind rider master Devrak, then bring Zargh's Meats to Gryshka in Orgrimmar.^For just a few coins I will have a wind rider bring you to Orgrimmar. When you get there, you can take Zargh's Meats to Gryshka. Her inn is in the Valley of Strength, not far from the Skytower, where my wind rider will drop you off. Speak with me again when you are ready for the journey.Doras the Wind Rider Master^10^Orc, Troll^The Barrens^Innkeeper Gryshka^Doras^Meats to Orgrimmar^^^Bring Gryshka's Letter to Doras in Orgrimmar.^I've written a letter of thanks to Zargh. Will you deliver it for me? If you've already been to the Crossroads and spoken with their wind rider master, then you can fly a wind rider back there. Take my letter to Doras, the wind rider master of Orgrimmar, and speak with him about transport to the Crossroads.Return to the Crossroads.^10^Orc, Troll^The Barrens^Doras^Zargh^Meats to Orgrimmar^^^Buy a wind rider to the Crossroads from the wind rider master Doras, then bring Gryshka's Letter to Zargh at the Crossroads.^My wind riders are trained to fly to many different places, as long as you have already been to that place and spoken with the wind rider master there. You have been to the Crossroads and spoken to their wind rider master Devrak, so now you can fly directly to him from here. Once you're at the Crossroads, you can deliver Gryshka's letter to Zargh. Speak with me when you are ready to go.Honor Students^10^Dwarf, Gnome^Loch Modan^Brock Stoneseeker^Thorgrum Borrelson^Honor Students^^^Bring Brock's List to Thorgrum Borrelson in Thelsamar.^I see a lot of young dwarves at my door, eager to learn the trade of mining. And if there's one thing a miner needs more than anything, it's a pick! I have a list of mining students who scored high in their lessons and earned an honorary pick. Take my list to Golnir Bouldertoe in Ironforge. He'll get the picks ready. The fastest way to Ironforge is on a gryphon, so bring the list to our gryphon master, Thorgrum Borrelson, and speak with him about transport to Ironforge.Gryth Thurden^10^Dwarf, Gnome^Loch Modan^Golnir Bouldertoe^Gryth Thurden^Honor Students^^^Bring the Honorary Picks to Gryth Thurden in Ironforge.^Here are the honorary picks for Brock's students.

Speak with me when you're ready to go.Elemental War^25^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Tsunaman^Tsunaman^^^^Bring 10 Incendrites to Tsunaman at Sun Rock Retreat.^The Tribunal of the Tides has sent me to wage war on the fire elementals here in Stonetalon Mountain. Neptulon the Tidehunter, Lord of all water elementals, has taken a personal interest in seeing our fiery cousins extinguished. <name>, you can help me gain favor with the Tribunal by destroying the fire elementals in Charred Vale.

Marla was spared an undeath only to die at the hands of her now mindless husband. So strong was her love, however, that her last dying wish was to be buried with her beloved Samuel. Samuel Fipps roams at a ruined camp along the road northeast of Deathknell. Defeat him and grant Marla's wish: bury him at her grave, in the first row of our graveyard.Kaya's Alive^18^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Makaba Flathoof^Tammra Windfield^Protect Kaya^^^Tell Tammra Windfield in Sun Rock Retreat the good news.^Tell Tammra Windfield, Kaya's aunt who's at Sun Rock Retreat, about the good news!

Can you feel the tension in the air, <name>? Southeast of here lies a deep cave in Boulderslide Ravine. The kobolds there are frantically mining a rare crystal called Resonite. I need you to bring back some ore samples so that I can understand what's happening in that cave. I also need you to investigate the depth of that cave. Go young <class>, it's imperative I know what evil lurks under these mountains.Satyr Horns^26^Horde^Ashenvale^Pixel^Pixel^^^^Collect 16 Satyr Horns for Pixel in Splintertree Post.^Heya! I've been traveling through Ashenvale, heading towards Ratchet, and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days. After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs... but you look like you might be! Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time.Naga at the Zoram Strand^19^Horde^Ashenvale^Marukai^Marukai^^^^Bring 20 Wrathtail Heads to Marukai along the Zoram Strand.^There is evil lurking here along the coast, <race>.

Lately, we have attracted the wrong dinner guests... the spiders in these mountains have been raiding our camps at night looking to steal our hunt. If you were to help us kill off these ghastly beasts we at Malaka'Jin would be in your debt. Spiders are everywhere in Stonetalon - just head north from here and you will see what I am talking about.Troll Charm^24^Horde^Ashenvale^Mitsuwa^Mitsuwa^^^^Bring 8 Troll Charms to Mitsuwa at the Zoram'gar Outpost.^My kinfolk were traveling here with many sacred troll charms, but the Thistlefur furbolgs attacked and killed them before they reached Zoram'gar! Those vile Furbolgs! I miss my brothers and sisters who were killed, but we will meet again in the afterlife. However, their troll charms hold great value in this world. It is an outrage that the furbolgs have them! <name>, you must retrieve the charms! They are in chests in Thistlefur Hold, a cave at the end of Thistlefur Village, north of Astranaar.Earthen Arise^20^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Mor'rogal^Mor'rogal^^Boulderslide Ravine^^Open the Resonite cask with the Enchanted Resonite Crystal, and then slay Goggeroc. Return to Mor'rogal with the news and Enchanted Resonite Crystal.^You have uncovered a dark threat to the land, <class>.

I must escape!Ashenvale Outrunners^24^Horde^Ashenvale^Kuray'bin^Kuray'bin^^^^Kill 9 Ashenvale Outrunners, then return to Kuray'bin at Splintertree Outpost.^We received reports that Ashenvale outrunners left Silverwing Outpost not long ago, and now sneak near our territories in the forest. We don't want them gathering intelligence on our defenses! Sneak through the forests south of our post here and east of the Alliance outpost of Silverwing.

Return the pages to Gurda Ragescar near Splintertree Post.^I just picked up this shredder from Ratchet and I was on my way back to the Warsong Lumber Camp, where I am supposed to be on duty. I was given a manual on how to operate the shredder, but on the trip back, a huge gust of wind blew it from my hands. The pages went everywhere, and all I was left with was the cover. The pages could be just about anywhere by now, I suppose... but I don't know how to use the shredder without them! Will you find them for me?An Unholy Alliance^36^Horde^Razorfen Downs^Varimathras^Varimathras^An Unholy Alliance^^^Bring Ambassador Malcin's Head to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity.^Malcin claims he is outside Razorfen Downs. This ambassador must be slain--his mission a failure in the eyes of the Lich King. His presence there does explain much of what we've discovered about the area--some of the quilboar have grown frightfully powerful while showing signs of the Plague in their own way. Truly that must be a sign of some sort of deal they've struck. Find Malcin and slay him, <name>.

The opportunity for you to take the Barrens and the lands beyond is a great one. We simply want your aid in return. By aid we mean nothing more than your giving us the freedom to take action in the area. Please, allow us to discuss this further. We have great power and are willing to share with those wise enough to join us. I will remain outside Razorfen Downs for the time being. Best Regards,Ambassador MalcinProtect Kaya^18^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Kaya Flathoof^Makaba Flathoof^Protect Kaya^^^Escort Kaya Flathoof to Camp Aparaje, and then return to Makaba Flathoof near the southeastern edge of Stonetalon.^Thank you for rescuing me!

The horde has recently set up an outpost on the Zoram Strand there, and we can always use some new recruits to help defend our new fronts. If you think you are up to it, see Kadrak in the northern Barrens, at the watch tower. He is heading up the Ashenvale campaign and can give you further orders.Report to Kadrak^19^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Darn Talongrip^Kadrak^Report to Kadrak^^^Report to Kadrak at the watch tower in northern Barrens.^Have you ever been to Ashenvale, to the north? The horde has recently set up an outpost on the Zoram Strand there, and we can always use some new recruits to help defend our new fronts. If you think you are up to it, see Kadrak in the northern Barrens, at the watch tower. He is heading up the Ashenvale campaign and can give you further orders.The Warsong Reports^19^Horde^Ashenvale^Kadrak^Kadrak^Report to Kadrak^^^Open the Bundle of Reports. Take the Warsong Reports to the Warsong Scout, Warsong Runner, and Warsong Outrider. Bring back the updates they give you to Kadrak at the northern watch tower in the barrens.^I recently deployed a few scouts into Ashenvale and I need a runner to take them their orders, and bring me back a report of what they have observed. Your first stop should be the Zoram'gar Outpost, along the coast to the west, at the Zoram Strand, to locate the first runner. You also need to stop at Splintertree Post, to the north, and along the road to the east, near Azshara. You will find a scout and an outrider there. Give them each a report, and from them, get an update on their findings.Torek's Assault^24^Horde^Ashenvale^Torek^Ertog Ragetusk^^^^Escort Torek on his attack against Silverwing Outpost and Duriel Moonfire, then report to Ertog Ragetusk at Splintertree Post.^Hey! <class>! Come here! My raiders and I are about to attack the Silverwing Outpost to the west. Our target is its leader, Duriel Moonfire. Scouts report the outpost is defended heavily with sentinels and warriors. The battle will be glorious! Do you want to share in the glory, <name>, and aid us? If so, then when it's over you can report our success to my superior, Ertog Ragetusk in Splintertree. What do you say. Are you with us?Avenge My Village^18^Horde^Stonetalon Mountains^Makaba Flathoof^Makaba Flathoof^Avenge My Village^^^Kill 8 Grimtotem Ruffians and 6 Grimtotem Mercenaries, and then return to Makaba Flathoof near the southeastern edge of Stonetalon.^The Grimtotem Clan raided my village and killed most everyone. I killed all I could, but barely escaped with my life. <name>, all I wish now is that more of them are dead. You will find them just to the west of here. Blackfathom Villainy^27^Horde^Blackfathom Deeps^Argent Guard Thaelrid^Bashana Runetotem^^^^Bring the head of Twilight Lord Kelris to Bashana Runetotem in Thunder Bluff.^Strength has left me. Your help is needed! Long ago this site was a great temple of Elune. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an Old God seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred Moon Well. Aku'Mai, servant of the Old God, rose from the waters. The Twilight's Hammer cultists have allied with the naga to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power. Slay Kelris and bring his head to Bashana in Thunder Bluff, <name>, please.Trouble in the Deeps^22^Horde^Blackfathom Deeps^Tsunaman^Je'neu Sancrea^Trouble in the Deeps^^^Speak to Je'neu Sancrea in Ashenvale.^Je'neu Sancrea is in need of aid. He is at the Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale. The Night elf forest is to the north of the Stonetalon mountains. You can reach it by traveling through Windshear Crag or by heading north through Barrens. Zoram Strand is far to the west of the forest. Be careful, <name>. There are forces there that will not take to your presence kindly.The Essence of Aku'Mai^22^Horde^Blackfathom Deeps^Je'neu Sancrea^Je'neu Sancrea^Trouble in the Deeps^^Amongst the Ruins^Bring 20 Sapphires of Aku'Mai to Je'neu Sancrea in Ashenvale.^Within the beginning tunnels of Blackfathom Deeps, large sapphire clusters can be found along the cave walls. Recently it was noted that the naga were harvesting the crystals. Until it can be discerned why, I sense we should stop the naga from succeeding. The crystals have great elemental power and if used inappropriately, could make for a powerful arcane component. Will you help me, <name>? Blackfathom Deeps can be found along Zoram Strand to the north of our outpost.Allegiance to the Old Gods^22^Horde^Blackfathom Deeps^Damp Note^Je'neu Sancrea^Allegiance to the Old Gods^^^Bring the Damp Note to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale.^Some poor handwriting is scrawled on the crumpled up note: "Yes, tell all the priestesses to bring the crystals to me. The water elemental spirits are strong within them and they will aid our aquamancers greatly in their own summonings. By controlling the power within the crystals, we will appease Aku'Mai. One day we will have enough power to bring Aku'Mai back to us and the world will return to its greatest era! An era of rule by the Old Gods!"Allegiance to the Old Gods^26^Horde^Blackfathom Deeps^Je'neu Sancrea^Je'neu Sancrea^Allegiance to the Old Gods^^^Kill Lorgus Jett in Blackfathom Deeps and then return to Je'neu Sancrea in Ashenvale.^This Twilight's Hammer follower cannot be allowed to complete his plan. The Twilight's Hammer do not understand the spirits of nature. They believe in the Old Gods--creatures of chaos and destruction that were long ago defeated. This Lorgus cannot be allowed to succeed. You must stop him, <name>. I cannot do it myself--I am too weak. Go into Blackfathom Deeps, find him, and kill him. Return to me here at Zoram'gar when it's done.What the Wind Carries^60^Horde^Orgrimmar^Thrall^Thrall^What the Wind Carries^For The Horde!^^Listen to Thrall.^It is good to see you again, <name>.

However he has left Azeroth to join our expedition into Outland. However, he left his companion, Rokaro, in Shadowprey Village with this information. You are to seek him out.Mistress of Deception^60^Horde^Desolace^Rokaro^Myranda the Hag^What the Wind Carries^^^Deliver Rokaro's Letter to Myranda the Hag in the Western Plaguelands.^Illusion and disguise. That is how you will fool the Black Dragonflight, and gain what you seek. Though I could teach you something of the skills of deception, you need the help of a master. I know of one who could do this. In the Western Plaguelands, you will find Myranda the Hag, once a master illusionist of Lordaeron. She has helped us in the past, and if she believes the cause worthy, she may help you. Take this message to her.Oculus Illusions^60^Horde^Blackrock Spire^Myranda the Hag^Myranda the Hag^What the Wind Carries^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and collect 20 Black Dragonspawn Eyes. Return to Myranda the Hag when the task is complete.^So the <race> wishes to become one of the Black Flight, eh? The creation of the illusion you require is trivial, but the components required for the divination are quite difficult to obtain. The Warchief has entrusted you with this mission, so Myranda must assume you as capable. Travel to the upper citadel of Blackrock Spire and slay enough of the black dragonspawn to fill up one of your packs with their eyes. Return to Myranda when you have gathered enough of the reagent.Emberstrife^60^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Myranda the Hag^Emberstrife^What the Wind Carries^^The Test of Skulls, Scryer, The Test of Skulls, Somnus, The Test of Skulls, Chronalis^Travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh and seek out Emberstrife's Den. Once inside, wear the Amulet of Draconic Subversion and speak with Emberstrife.^I have attuned this medallion with the magic necessary to create and maintain an illusion within the bounds of the den of Emberstrife. Emberstrife is an ancient drake; an old gatekeeper of Nefarian, burdened with the duty to test those dragonspawn that would ascend to the rank of elite guard to Onyxia. Travel to the Wyrmbog of Dustwallow Marsh and enter the lair of Emberstrife. Once there, put on the amulet and follow where your destiny may lead!Warsong Supplies^27^Horde^Ashenvale^Locke Okarr^Locke Okarr^^^^Collect the Warsong Supplies: Warsong Saw Blades, Logging Rope, Warsong Oil, and the Warsong Axe Shipment for Locke Okarr in Splintertree Post.^We are in short supply of a few items at the Warsong lumber camp! Pixel at Splintertree Post has our shipment of saw blades. It'll take a trip to Booty Bay to pick up a crate of axes from Wharfmaster Lozgil. Our shipment of oil and rope will be more difficult. The rope was pilfered by the Thistlefur and Foulweald furbolgs, and the satyrs intercepted the delivery of the oil and are now using it for detestable rituals in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian! Can you help me?The Test of Skulls, Scryer^60^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Emberstrife^Emberstrife^^Emberstrife^The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^You must find the blue dragonflight drake champion, Scryer, and slay him. Pry his skull from his corpse and return it to Emberstrife.^We are Deathwing's children, whelp. Our dominance over the lesser Aspects must be enforced. If you are truly worthy of ascension, the lesser dragonflight will wilt in your presence. Find their champions and lay waste to them in the name of our Father! Travel to Winterspring and track down the mighty blue drake, Scryer. Crush him and any of the Blue Flight that stand in your path. Tear out his skull and return it to me.The Test of Skulls, Somnus^60^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Emberstrife^Emberstrife^^Emberstrife^The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^Destroy the drake champion of the Green Flight, Somnus. Take his skull and return it to Emberstrife.^Just as our Father crushes the Aspects themselves, so too must we strive to bring chaos and destruction to their children. You must test your battle prowess against the sleepless dreamers: The children of the Green Flight. Travel to the Swamp of Sorrows and track down Somnus, drake champion of the Green Flight. Let flow your hatred; dominate the insect... Return to me with his skull...The Test of Skulls, Chronalis^60^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Emberstrife^Emberstrife^^Emberstrife^The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^Guarding the Caverns of Time in the Tanaris Desert is Chronalis, child of Nozdormu. Destroy him and return his skull to Emberstrife.^The time watchers, children of Nozdormu - Lord of the Centuriesss... It is three that guard the Caverns of Time, but only one that holds the interests of the Black Flight: The Time Shifter, Chronalis, favored drakeling of Nozdormu. Ssstrike at this champion, a blow to make even the stoic sands of time weep. Return to me with his skull.The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^60^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Emberstrife^Emberstrife^The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^The Test of Skulls, Scryer, The Test of Skulls, Somnus, The Test of Skulls, Chronalis^^Travel to Grim Batol and track down Axtroz, drake champion of the Red Flight. Destroy him and take his skull. Return the skull to Emberstrife.^It was over the mountains of Grim Batol that our Father raged against the combined might of the Aspects. The cowardly act of the betrayer, Alexstrasza, bought the other Aspects enough time to escape from Father's wrath. Sssuch a shameful act... The Red Flight now guards Grim Batol, their lieutenant, Axtroz, must be destroyed. Return the skull of Axtroz to me. For Father, whelp!Ascension...^60^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Emberstrife^Rokaro^The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^^^It would appear as if the charade is over. You know that the Amulet of Draconic Subversion that Myranda the Hag created for you will not function inside Blackrock Spire. Perhaps you should find Rokaro and explain your predicament. Show him the Dull Drakefire Amulet. Hopefully he will know what to do next.^From the skulls of our enemies is shaped a medallion. You know this medallion, yesss? You have no doubt seen it worn by your elders. Take it, whelp. Return to the Spire and present it to General Drakkisath. The General will place the final enchantment upon the medallion, attuning the trinket to your spirit. You will wear the finished medallion as a badge of honor, symbolizing your ascension to one of our most guarded ranks: Guardian to the brood mother. Go!Blood of the Black Dragon Champion^60^Horde^Blackrock Spire^Rokaro^Rokaro^The Test of Skulls, Axtroz^^^Travel to Blackrock Spire and slay General Drakkisath. Gather his blood and return it to Rokaro.^How would you feel about paying a visit to the General? No illusions, this time. Ceremony? A pretty word to describe the bloodletting that amuses the Black Dragonflight. All this amulet requires is the blood of General Drakkisath. Primitive security. There are other ways to receive the General's blood. Go to Blackrock Spire and kill Drakkisath. Return with his blood and I will activate the key to Onyxia's lair.Trouble in Winterspring!^56^All^Winterspring^Meggi Peppinrocker^Donova Snowden^Trouble in Winterspring!^^^Find Donova Snowden near the hot springs in Winterspring.^There's trouble in Winterspring! Why, sure, I spend some time out in the wilds and know about these things... I'm always mighty proud to say it. I consider the hours I spend out there in the hills to be golden. Help you cultivate quick reflexes, a cool head and a keen eye... It takes judgement, brains and maturity to appreciate the wilderness in the way that I do. Now, what was I talking about? Ah yes, trouble. See Donova Snowden at the hot springs and she can tell you more. Enraged Wildkin^59^Alliance^Winterspring^Harlo Wigglesworth^Jaron Stoneshaper^^^^Speak with Jaron Stoneshaper at Starfall Village.^Have you noticed the abandoned camp to the south of here? It looks like the wildkin went crazy and destroyed just about everything they could find! I heard a rumor that one of the survivors of the attack is resting at Starfall Village, west of here. I'm sure curious about what happened... aren't you?A Strange One^54^Horde^Winterspring^Harlo Wigglesworth^Winna Hazzard^A Strange One^^^Speak with Winna Hazzard in Felwood.^I just got back from Felwood, <name>. On my way through, I stopped at Bloodvenom Post and I met a very odd character... She seemed intent on one thing, and I suppose I could tell you what that is, but I think she'd like to explain it to you herself. If you're interested, head to Bloodvenom Post in western Felwood and look for Winna Hazzard. Who knows, she might need your help...Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme^45^All^Fishing^Nat Pagle^Nat Pagle^^^^Nat Pagle wants you to catch the following fish:^Can't say I really enjoy fishin' much. Figure I been at it for a good 20 or 30 years now. I reckon people are driven to do what they do for different reasons. Now, I'm not saying you need to fish for 30 years or catch every fish in the sea to become a master fisherman. I reckon you just need to be determined - determined enough to sit on your duff for hours at a time, doin' nothin'. I'll tell you what, catch me a few rare fish and I'll teach you a thing or two. Here's a list:You Too Good.^45^Horde^Fishing^Lumak^Nat Pagle^^^^You think Lumak is trying to tell you that he can no longer help you improve your fishing skill. You may want to try to find his friend, Nat Pagle, a human fishing off one of the islands south of Theramore (at least that's what you think Lumak said).^Lumak no can teach <name> no more.

They are not as many as the Thistlefur, but their ferocity poses a future threat. With a show of force, we can remove that threat. Take this banner, go to the Foulweald village and place it on their totem mound. They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe. Bring me the totem he carries. Gather your allies, <name>. This is no task for a single <class>.Triage^35^Horde^First Aid^Doctor Gregory Victor^Doctor Gregory Victor^^^^Save patients by using Triage Bandages to tend to their wounds.

This diplomat seems to be granting undeath to would-be followers. I am beginning to think he is one of the Scourge. For now, my concern is not with him though, it's with the growing ranks around him. They creep from the shadows daily, almost begging him for more power. I'm not powerful enough to fight them on my own, <name>. What do you say? Are you up for some hunting?Test of Lore^30^Horde^Thousand Needles^Braug Dimspirit^Braug Dimspirit^Test of Faith^^^Answer Braug Dimspirit's question successfully and then speak to him again.

If you dare, Grundig Darkcloud and his personal band of brutes is by far the worst of the lot. He was the one who led the brutal attack on my village.

She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path. But I am ready, <name>. I have prepared to best the hydra and end these attacks on Zoram'gar. The naga honor the wicked nature of this beast with a brazier that remains lit on an island just off the coast. I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger.

Speak to him on this matter - NOT me. Let me give you some... friendly... advice. It is I who led us out of the darkness - NOT the Cenarion Circle in Moonglade - when all was lost for our race. Teldrassil gives us all new life! They would have you believe otherwise, and to believe their propaganda would be a fool's task. I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you're a fool.Rabine Saturna^55^Alliance^Darnassus^Mathrengyl Bearwalker^Rabine Saturna^The New Frontier^^Wasteland^Speak with Rabine Saturna in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade.

You should find him in Nighthaven, the main village of Moonglade. While your work will no doubt be of tremendous benefit to us all, I advise you to tread gingerly. There are tensions between Darnassus and Moonglade... ones that may grow over the course of time.Stormers and Rumblers^57^All^Azshara^Duke Hydraxis^Duke Hydraxis^^^Eye of the Emberseer^Kill 15 Dust Stormers and 15 Desert Rumblers and then return to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.^We, the elementals of water, wage war with those beings of the lesser elements. If you are truly our ally in this conflict, then show me your conviction! Far to the south, in the desert land of Silithus, the servants of air and earth scurry in a corner of rock named the Crystal Vale. They protect items of power from smaller beings, mortals, and although I do not know why they do this, I wish to foil their efforts. Go to the Crystal Vale in Silithus and defeat our enemies, then return to me.Eye of the Emberseer^60^All^Azshara^Duke Hydraxis^Duke Hydraxis^Eye of the Emberseer^Poisoned Water, Stormers and Rumblers^^Bring the Eye of the Emberseer to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.^You have shown me that you can defeat our enemies and perform missions to further the cause of the Waterlords. But until now you have only faced lesser foes... if pitted against a powerful enemy, can you prevail? That is your new task. High up in Blackrock Spire the orcs have captured a servant of fire, the Pyroguard Emberseer. Find his place of imprisonment, slay his captors, and then slay the emberseer. Bring me his eye and it will show me your worth.The Molten Core^60^All^Azshara^Duke Hydraxis^Duke Hydraxis^Eye of the Emberseer^^^Kill 1 Fire Lord, 1 Molten Giant, 1 Ancient Core Hound and 1 Lava Surger, then return to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.^<name>, perhaps it is time to give you a real test. Are you ready? At the bottom of Blackrock Depths is a passage to the Molten Core. This is a stronghold of our enemy, held by the most powerful servants of fire on this world. Go to the Molten Core, <name>. Show me you have the strength and the will to defeat what you find there. And if you have allies among your people, then rally them. Nothing short of an army can hope to enter the Molten Core and live.Agent of Hydraxis^60^All^Azshara^Duke Hydraxis^Duke Hydraxis^Eye of the Emberseer^^^Earn an Honored faction with the Hydraxian Waterlords, then talk to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.^If you truly wish an allegiance with us, then I invite you to wage war on our foes, the servants of air and earth and fire. Each defeat you heap upon them will weaken their foothold here, and further prove your adherence to our cause. The campaign will be long, but if you persevere then your glory and honor will be great.Hands of the Enemy^60^All^Azshara^Duke Hydraxis^Duke Hydraxis^Eye of the Emberseer^^A Hero's Reward^Bring the Hands of Lucifron, Sulfuron, Gehennas and Shazzrah to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.^<name>, your service is of great value to us, so we are reluctant to send you on this last mission for we do not want to lose such a useful agent. But its success would further our war efforts tremendously and... it was deemed worth risking you. We want these captains in the Molten Core destroyed: Lucifron, Sulfuron, Gehennas and Shazzrah. Kill them and bring me their hands! This task will take every resource you possess, <name>, but if can do it then the Firelords will be dealt a terrible blow.Umber, Archivist^57^All^Silithus^Layo Starstrike^Umber^The New Frontier^^^Take the Encrusted Silithid Object to Umber - the Cenarion Circle's archivist - in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade.^There's plenty to do here still, but I think taking this back to the Circle for analysis is key. Trust me - the work will still be here once this is all said and done. If it's a journal inside this sticky chitin, then the Circle would finally have a window into the past! Take this to the Circle's archivist in Nighthaven. His name is Umber, and the man's brilliant. Touched, sure, but brilliant nonetheless! Umber's salvaged tomes in far worse shape than this. If it can be saved, he can do it.Uncovering Past Secrets^57^All^Moonglade^Umber^Rabine Saturna^The New Frontier^^Under the Chitin Was...^Speak with Rabine Saturna in the village of Nighthaven, Moonglade.^Anyway, you should check back with me relatively soon... that is if you want to know what was in here. As soon as I find out what it is, and if it's indeed a book, I'd be happy to share that information with you. In the meantime, I'd check in with the den mother of this little bear camp, Rabine. No doubt he'll want to know what crazy antics you've been up to. Never leave the den mother waiting, <name>... that is, unless you want to be doused in honey. It's happened, trust me.Zinfizzlex's Portable Shredder Unit^60^Horde^Alterac Valley^Master Engineer Zinfizzlex^Master Engineer Zinfizzlex^^^^Master Engineer Zinfizzlex wants you to bring him the following:^I'm as anxious as you are to try out my portable shredder unit, <race>, but before I can make the kit, I'm going to need materials - lots of materials! To be exact, I'm going to need a mountain of thorium, mithril, and iron. I will also need one steamsaw per unit. You'll have to get those at the lumber mill. When I was nosing around in here (before my capture) I noticed a pile of steamsaws at the Stormpike lumber camp.Zinfizzlex's Portable Shredder Unit^60^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Master Engineer Zinfizzlex^Master Engineer Zinfizzlex^^^^Master Engineer Zinfizzlex wants you to bring him the following:^I'm as anxious as you are to try out my portable shredder unit, <race>, but before I can make the kit, I'm going to need materials - lots of materials! To be exact, I'm going to need a mountain of thorium, mithril, and iron. I will also need one steamsaw per unit. You'll have to get those at the lumber mill. When I was nosing around in here (before my capture) I noticed a pile of steamsaws at the Frostwolf lumber camp.Amongst the Ruins^27^Horde^Blackfathom Deeps^Je'neu Sancrea^Je'neu Sancrea^^^^Bring the Fathom Core to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale.^The Twilight's Hammer has moved into the Moonshrine Ruins of Blackfathom Deeps. Their presence can only serve to coerce the elements into working against us. If left unchecked, this region will be theirs for good. <name>, go into Blackfathom and find the ruin's fathom stone; it should be somewhere close in the water. In it is a fathom core - a device that when properly read it will relate a history of all elemental activity. If I have it, I and the Earthen Ring can maybe do something to stop them!Baron Aquanis^30^Horde^Ashenvale^Strange Water Globe^Je'neu Sancrea^^^^Bring the Strange Water Globe to Je'neu Sancrea at Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale.^The defeated water elemental has left behind a strange water globe. You surmise that the object somehow fed the beast energy. Inside the globe, a putrid-looking form of water sloshes about. The globe itself seems impervious to any sort of physical force. If anyone can make any sense of this item, it would be Je'neu Sancrea of the Earthen Ring. He is located at the Horde's Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale.The Glowing Shard^26^All^Wailing Caverns^Glowing Shard^Falla Sagewind^^^In Nightmares, In Nightmares^Travel to Ratchet to find someone that can tell you more about the glowing shard.^The shard is a brilliant green, and although solid, what looks like smoke swirls just below the surface. You can't help staring into the depths of the crystal; at the same time, you know there is something very disturbing about it. Maybe you should see if anyone in Ratchet can tell you more about this strange shard.Coldtooth Supplies^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Stormpike Quartermaster^Stormpike Quartermaster^^^^Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Alliance Quartermaster in Dun Baldar.^The Coldtooth mine is a storage depot for the Horde. I can't stomach the food they give their troops, and the state of their arms and armor is atrocious! But... in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have. Enter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies. That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors. Good luck, <name>. The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory.Irondeep Supplies^51^Horde^Alterac Valley^Frostwolf Quartermaster^Frostwolf Quartermaster^^^^Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Horde Quartermaster in Frostwolf Keep.^The Stormpike dwarves are using the Irondeep mine as a storage depot. I want you to raid that mine and bring me its supplies. This will curtail the Stormpikes' efforts in Alterac Valley, and will provide us with needed equipment! Be wary, <name>. The Irondeep mine is deep in Alliance territory, and control of the mine is as shifting as the snows of Alterac.Empty Stables^51^Horde^Alterac Valley^Frostwolf Stable Master^Frostwolf Stable Master^^^^Locate a Frostwolf in Alterac Valley. Use the Frostwolf Muzzle when you are near the Frostwolf to 'tame' the beast. Once tamed, the Frostwolf will follow you back to the Frostwolf Stable Master. Speak with the Frostwolf Stable Master to earn credit for the capture.^The war in the valley has taken its toll on our soldiers. We must revitalize our forces! If we can fill up the stables, the Wolf Riders will once more be able to ride out into the field of battle. Take this muzzle and track down the frostwolves that inhabit the nearby forest. Once you find a wolf, use the muzzle to tame the beast. Bring the tamed beast back to me so that I may place it in the stable. When we have enough wolves stabled, the Wolf Riders will rejoin their patrol on our front lines.Zapped Giants^48^All^Feralas^Zorbin Fandazzle^Zorbin Fandazzle^^^Again With the Zapped Giants^Use Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker to zap any kind of giant found in Feralas into a more manageable form. Bring 15 Miniaturization Residues found on the zapped versions of these giants to Zorbin Fandazzle at the docks of the Forgotten Coast, Feralas.^I'm going to have to do something about the giants if I stay out here! They're certainly not good for business, now are they? I've been working on a variant of a gnomish shrinking ray, but I'm using superior GOBLIN technological advances in its construction! In an effort to avoid inconveniences for myself such as death, I'd like for you to try it out on any of the giants in Feralas. You should find miniaturization residue on them after you shrink them - bring me back some!Empty Stables^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Stormpike Stable Master^Stormpike Stable Master^^^^Locate an Alterac Ram in Alterac Valley. Use the Stormpike Training Collar when you are near the Alterac Ram to 'tame' the beast. Once tamed, the Alterac Ram will follow you back to the Stable Master. Speak with the Stable Master to earn credit for the capture.^Just look at the stables, <name>! Empty! The Stormpike Brigade has no rams to ride - the cavalry is defunct. You must help us, soldier. Take this training collar and enter the wilds of this valley. Locate the Alterac rams that roam throughout the area and use the collar to snare one. When you have captured a ram, return it to me and I shall place it in our stable. When we have enough rams, the ram rider commander will be notifed. With your help, the cavalry will be reborn!Twisted Evils^47^All^Maraudon^Willow^Willow^^^^Collect 15 Theradric Crystal Carvings for Willow in Desolace.^The crystal caverns of Terramok lie to the west, deep within Maraudon... It is an ancient place with much history. And I am looking to get my hands on some of it, <class>. Relics of the old gods lie hidden behind the giant doors. If you are willing to brave the twisted evils found in Maraudon, I believe I can make it worth your time. Collect the theradric crystal carvings you find, and return them to me. Once I get the carvings, I will be able to... study them. These powers have been too long at rest...Vyletongue Corruption^47^Horde^Maraudon^Vark Battlescar^Vark Battlescar^^^^Fill the Coated Cerulean Vial at the orange crystal pool in Maraudon.^A satyr known as Vyletongue has corrupted the caverns of Maraudon, stunting the growth of many of the plants inside. Take this vial, <name>. Fill it at the orange crystal pool found inside the caverns; the coating inside the vial will counter the toxins, turning it into a healing agent. Find the Vylestem vines inside the orange caverns, and use the purified liquid on them. The corruption will be purged from the plant, but do know that Vyletongue will still control it. He may use it against you...Vyletongue Corruption^47^Alliance^Maraudon^Talendria^Talendria^^^^Fill the Coated Cerulean Vial at the orange crystal pool in Maraudon.^A satyr known as Vyletongue has corrupted the caverns of Maraudon, stunting the growth of many of the plants inside.

He still resides beyond the purple crystals. Vyletongue also created a living symbol of his corruption called Noxxion that dwells beyond the orange crystals. Together, they have stolen the two parts of my brother's scepter. Celebras, my brother... he wanders blindly inside, cursed by corruption. You must help him! Find the pieces, and speak to my brother... somehow.The Scepter of Celebras^49^All^Maraudon^Celebras the Redeemed^Celebras the Redeemed^^Legends of Maraudon^^Assist Celebras the Redeemed while he creates the Scepter of Celebras.^My scepter was once a source of hope for me. It once granted me power over these caverns. I had hoped to bring peace to the spirit of my uncle... For the two parts to once again become one, I will need your assistance in performing the ritual. Please follow me, and listen to my instructions while I channel the energy required to reunite the rod with the diamond. Together, we shall create the Scepter of Celebras once again!Corruption of Earth and Seed^51^Horde^Maraudon^Selendra^Selendra^^^^Slay Princess Theradras and return to Selendra near Shadowprey Village in Desolace.^Deep in Maraudon lives an evil creature of chaos--Princess Theradras is an elemental force of earth related to the Old Gods. Ages ago, she and Zaetar, first son of Cenarius, began a relationship. The offspring of their time together became known to the people of Kalimdor as centaur. Ever-thankful creatures, the centaur killed Zaetar, and now hold Zaetar's remains. My quest here is to find those powerful enough to slay Theradras so we may recover Zaetar's remains before returning to Stonetalon.Corruption of Earth and Seed^51^Alliance^Maraudon^Keeper Marandis^Keeper Marandis^^^^Slay Princess Theradras and return to Keeper Marandis at Nijel's Point in Desolace.^In the depths of Maraudon lives a creature of chaos and evil, <name>.

Look around you--this place rings of hope and all that my father Cenarius preaches. It sprung from me! And I cannot take that away from them... not even for their crimes against me. But there is one thing I would ask of you to ease my brother's mind. Take this... it is the first seed that fell from the life my remains nourished. Tell him my spirit remains here, and that I live on. I am sure he will understand.The Pariah's Instructions^48^All^Maraudon^Centaur Pariah^Centaur Pariah^^^^Read the Pariah's Instructions. Afterwards, obtain the Amulet of Union from Maraudon and return it to the Centaur Pariah in southern Desolace.^Though exiled as a heretic, my beliefs still ring true--that alone drives me onward. But for my destiny to be complete, I need the aid of an outsider... one not of any centaur tribe. The task requires someone to enter the holy halls of Maraudon--a tomb my people protect, and only the most devout are ever allowed to enter. If you agree to aid me, then you need only nod. I will pass you a parchment with my instructions on it. Read it over and consider my words.Shadowshard Fragments^42^Horde^Maraudon^Uthel'nay^Uthel'nay^^^^Collect 10 Shadowshard Fragments from Maraudon and return them to Uthel'nay in Orgrimmar.^Strong magics be found in the centaur holy place... the holy place of Maraudon.

The place be dangerous, so maybe you be bringing some friends.Shadowshard Fragments^42^Alliance^Maraudon^Archmage Tervosh^Archmage Tervosh^^^^Collect 10 Shadowshard Fragments from Maraudon and return them to Archmage Tervosh in Theramore on the coast of Dustwallow Marsh.^I've recently begun testing various crystals and their arcane properties. Lady Proudmoore has given me leave to ask travelers heading into Desolace to seek out a place called Maraudon. Within the ruined temple are great elementals composed of purplish stones I've named shadowshards. If you decide to head that direction and find some of the crystals, I would be very thankful. I could even fashion you a trinket from them if you so desired.Alterac Valley Graveyards^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Sergeant Durgen Stormpike^Sergeant Durgen Stormpike^^^^Assault a graveyard, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in the Alterac Mountains.^The graveyards in Alterac Valley are prized territories. Both the Horde and the Alliance fight savagely for these sacred grounds. Are you, <name>, ready to join that fight? I want you to assault an enemy graveyard. Find a graveyard with a Horde banner in its midst, and pull it from the ground! Do that, and your task will be complete.... But if you can also hold the graveyard for a few minutes, then our troops will soon come to relieve you.The Graveyards of Alterac^51^Horde^Alterac Valley^Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl^Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl^^^^Assault a graveyard, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in the Alterac Mountains.^The battle lines of Alterac Valley are ever shifting.

So to that end, I want you to attack a bunker that is controlled by the enemy. To do that, enter one with an Alliance banner. You will see another banner inside. Pull out that banner, and a white Horde banner will appear in its place. Well done! At that point your task for me will be complete, but if you hold the place long enough, and if the Alliance doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!Towers and Bunkers^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Sergeant Durgen Stormpike^Sergeant Durgen Stormpike^^^^Destroy the banner at an enemy tower or bunker, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in the Alterac Mountains.^Towers and bunkers are key defensive positions, and so we must hold as many as possible! I want you to attack a tower or a bunker in Alterac Valley. To do that, enter a tower with a Horde banner atop it. You will see another enemy banner inside.

The war in the Valley is waged on two fronts. The cannibal Winterax trolls also vie for power. They are lead by Korrak the Bloodrager - a cruel and cunning beast.

Slay the beast and be rewarded!The Last Element^54^Horde^Blackrock Depths^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^Shadowmage Vivian Lagrave^^Disharmony of Flame^^Travel to Blackrock Depths and recover 10 Essence of the Elements. Your first inclination is to search the golems and golem makers. You remember Vivian Lagrave also muttering something about elementals.^There is work to be had for those venturing into the depths, <name>. The Dark Irons have mastered creation of extremely powerful golems. Initial reports from our spies indicate that the dwarves use a unique power source to give their creations incomparable killing power. Just imagine what we could do with our abominations if we could get our hands on this essence of the elements! Turn that city upside down if you must, but do not return until you have found the essence! Payment will be worth the risk.Korrak the Bloodrager^60^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Lieutenant Haggerdin^Lieutenant Haggerdin^^^^According to legend, the leader of the mighty Winterax trolls appears at will to wreak havoc on the denizens of Alterac Valley.^The indigenous Winterax trolls of the region are ruthless savages that would love nothing more than to have our bones added to their foul stew. We must show them our might! We have recovered tomes from their caves that detail their leadership hierarchy. The artifacts indicate that their leader, Korrak the Bloodrager, tends to remain hidden until given a reason to make his presence known. Death to Korrak would mean death to Winterax Clan! Slay him and return.Armor Scraps^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Murgot Deepforge^Murgot Deepforge^^^More Armor Scraps^Bring 20 Armor Scraps to Murgot Deepforge in Dun Baldar.^Battles rage constantly in Alterac Valley, and the supplies we get from Ironforge are not enough to outfit our experienced troops.

You will find Alterac Valley north of Tarren Mill at the base of the Alterac Mountains.^The drums of war sound off in a distant land, <class>. The favored clan of your Warchief is under attack from the nefarious Stormpike Guard of Ironforge. By the looks of you, I can discern that you are indeed battle hardy and prepared to take on the cause of the Frostwolf. It is you who must now take the next step in your evolution.

Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks that would come back from the dead just to enjoy a bowl! Heh, heh... Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately. I used to head over to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt snapjaws, the nasty things, but I can't pull myself away from my work here. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the snapjaws, I'll show you how it's done!Favor Amongst the Darkspear^60^Horde^Alterac Valley^Najak Hexxen^Najak Hexxen^^^^You have been tasked with slaying opposing night elf players in Alterac Valley.^<Najak snarls.> Before the night elves existed there was troll. It was from troll that the night elves came. Their mutinous attacks against my people will not be tolerated. Staghelm seeks to wipe us out - to leave no trace of those that bore him and his ilk. It will not happen! For every night elf that you slay and decapitate, Najak will grant you favor amongst the Darkspear. Word of your deeds will be spread across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Go now and serve the Darkspear!Ally of the Tauren^60^Horde^Alterac Valley^Ravak Grimtotem^Ravak Grimtotem^^^^You have been tasked with slaying opposing gnome players in Alterac Valley.^The Elder Crone has sent me to this warzone to research the other races. More specifically, I am to collect gnome samples. Magatha is primarily interested in their survivability. Aye, the gnomes - while pitifully weak and miniscule - exude great resilience both in and out of combat. Fortunately for you, I am looking for ruffians to do Magatha's bidding. Return to me with tufts of gnome hair and you shall be known to the tauren as an ally.Defusing the Threat^51^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Stormpike Explosives Expert^Stormpike Explosives Expert^^^^Find the Frostwolf Explosives Expert and kill him. Return to the Stormpike Explosives Expert when the task is complete.^The Frostwolf have their front lines and bases booby trapped, <class>. You have to watch your step when invading enemy territory. If you want to make a solid strike against them, you must destroy their source of anti personnel munitions - I'm talking about their explosives expert. If you kill him, you are safe to disarm the mines. As long as he is kept down, the mines will also stay down. You will probably find him in a tower near the Iceblood Garrison. Good luck!Defusing the Threat^51^Horde^Alterac Valley^Frostwolf Explosives Expert^Frostwolf Explosives Expert^^^^Find the Stormpike Explosives Expert and kill him. Return to the Frostwolf Explosives Expert when the task is complete.^I know all about landmines. I'm the one that lays all the mines on the front lines here, after all. If you want to defuse the Stormpike mine fields, all you have to do is kill their explosives expert. That dwarven coward is no doubt hiding in the first tower on the Field of Strife. Take him out and those landmines won't come back after they've been disarmed. If you do happen to kill him, come back here and let me know. No good deed should go unrewarded.The Return of Korrak^60^Horde^Alterac Valley^Warmaster Laggrond^Warmaster Laggrond^^^^Should Korrak the Bloodrager make a return to the Field of Strife, seek him out and destroy him.^While it is true that Korrak has been slain, one question remains: Will he remain dead? Trolls are notorious for their other-worldly tribal magics. I would not be surprised if the fallen leader was raised from the dead to once more rule over his clan. You know what to do should this ever occur. <Warmaster Laggrond makes a cutting motion across his neck with his index finger.> And this time, I want his skull. Just keep your eyes peeled, soldier. Dismissed!Korrak the Everliving^60^Alliance^Alterac Valley^Lieutenant Haggerdin^Lieutenant Haggerdin^^^^Should Korrak the Bloodrager make a return to the Field of Strife, seek him out and destroy him.^There's something not quite right about all of this... Did anybody think to burn Korrak's corpse? Those trolls will stop at nothing to revive their fallen leader - as blue skinned pagan man-beasts often do. Just keep your eyes out, <name>. Don't be alarmed if Korrak makes a surprise appearance; and if he does, I want him executed - his corpse burned to ashes. For good measure, lop off his head and bring me his skull before you ignite the lifeless mass.Crown of the Earth^11^All^Teldrassil^Corithras Moonrage^Corithras Moonrage^Crown of the Earth^^^Fill the Amethyst Phial and bring it back to Corithras Moonrage in Dolanaar.^All was not well with Teldrassil, however. Staghelm's carefully made plans for the new World Tree had borne out as he had hoped, but there was one small problem, a problem to which many of the troubles on Teldrassil may be attributed. However, I will not get into that yet. You must visit the last moonwell, to the northwest in the Oracle Glade. Under the boughs of the Oracle Tree lies the first and most powerful of our wells. Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me.Pusillin and the Elder Azj'Tordin^58^All^Dire Maul^Azj'Tordin^Azj'Tordin^^^^Travel to Dire Maul and locate the Imp, Pusillin. Convince Pusillin to give you Azj'Tordin's Book of Incantations through any means necessary.^I had let my guard down for only one moment, stranger. In my haste to escape the grip of the fallen Prince, I was robbed. A most foul demon, the imp Pusillin, pilfered my book of incantations and the key to the once great halls of Eldre'Thalas. I no longer hold interest in the key, as I have exchanged my immortality for freedom, but I desperately need my book of incantations. Find the imp, Pusillin, and recover my book. Search the Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul for Pusillin.The Madness Within^60^All^Dire Maul^Shen'dralar Ancient^Shen'dralar Ancient^The Madness Within^^The Treasure of the Shen'dralar^You must destroy the guardians surrounding the 5 Pylons that power the Prison of Immol'thar. Once the Pylons have powered down, the force field surrounding Immol'thar will have dissipated.^Have you heard enough? Are you a <man/woman> of action? This madness must come to an end. The age of the immortals has long since passed. Destroy the guardians surrounding the pylons to lower the force field. When this is done, destroy Immol'thar. With the Prince's power greatly reduced, attack and end him. Lay the spirits of this city to rest, adventurer.The Treasure of the Shen'dralar^60^Alliance^Dire Maul^Shen'dralar Ancient^Treasure of the Shen'dralar^^The Madness Within^^Return to the Athenaeum and find the Treasure of the Shen'dralar. Claim your reward!^In the library, Athenaeum, you will find an ancient chest hidden beneath the stairway. Take from it that which you desire.Arcane Refreshment^60^All^Mage^Lorekeeper Lydros^Lorekeeper Lydros^^^^Travel to the Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul and slay the water elemental, Hydrospawn. Return to Lorekeeper Lydros in the Athenaeum with the Hydrospawn Essence.^A <race> mage! How wonderous. I have not seen one of your kind for... oh what is it going on now? 500 years! I have something that will quench your thirst, but first you must do a task for me. <Lydros snickers.> There is an anomaly in Eldre'Thalas. A water elemental has taken residence in the east wing. His presence must be catalogued! Venture to the Warpwood Quarter and extract a portion of the elemental essence of the Hydrospawn. Return it to me and I shall teach you a useful cantrip.Elven Legends^60^Horde^Dire Maul^Sage Korolusk^Sage Korolusk^^^^Search Dire Maul for Kariel Winthalus. Report back to Sage Korolusk at Camp Mojache with whatever information that you may find.^Several years ago, a lone elven master named Kariel Winthalus fled the devastation of his homeland with several ancient elven artifacts in tow. Our search for this lost master lead us from the ruins of Quel'Thalas, through the Burning Steppes, across the great expanses of the sea, to Feralas. We suspect that the elf sought sanctuary in the halls of Eldre'Thalas (what is now known as Dire Maul). You must find him, adventurer. Whether alive or dead, the knowledge he carried must be recovered!Elven Legends^60^Alliance^Dire Maul^Scholar Runethorn^Scholar Runethorn^^^^Search Dire Maul for Kariel Winthalus. Report back to Scholar Runethorn at Feathermoon with whatever information that you may find.^Several years ago, a lone elven master named Kariel Winthalus fled the devastation of his homeland with several ancient elven artifacts in tow. Our search for this lost master lead us from the ruins of Quel'Thalas, through the Burning Steppes, across the great expanses of the sea, to Feralas. We suspect that the elf sought sanctuary in the halls of Eldre'Thalas (what is now known as Dire Maul). You must find him, adventurer. Whether alive or dead, the knowledge he carried must be recovered!Libram of Focus^60^All^Dire Maul^Lorekeeper Lydros^Lorekeeper Lydros^^^^Bring a Libram of Focus, 1 Pristine Black Diamond, 4 Large Brilliant Shards, and 2 Skin of Shadow to Lorekeeper Lydros in Dire Maul to receive an Arcanum of Focus.^This libram almost aroused interest in one of the younger Lorekeeper's familiars. Poor thing, it was only a few weeks old. Those among you who are more magically inclined might find this item interesting. The Libram of Focus was lost in this wing. I can only assume one of the Highborne spirits holds it in their possession. Bring the Libram along with some large brilliant shards, skin of shadow, and a pristine black diamond and I shall conjure the Arcanum.Libram of Protection^60^All^Dire Maul^Lorekeeper Lydros^Lorekeeper Lydros^^^^Bring a Libram of Protection, 1 Pristine Black Diamond, 2 Large Brilliant Shards, and 1 Frayed Abomination Stitching to Lorekeeper Lydros in Dire Maul to receive an Arcanum of Protection.^He wept like an infant at the loss of this libram. Mind you, I myself have wept over texts - there is no greater loss than that of knowledge and history - but to cry over this nearly useless jumbling of incantations? Preposterous! It left me to believe that the Prince was doing him a favor in flaying the flesh from his bones. Bring the Libram along with a pristine black diamond, large brilliant shards, and a frayed abomination stitching and I shall recreate the Arcanum. Oh, and check the north wing.A Hero's Reward^60^All^Azshara^Duke Hydraxis^Hydraxis' Coffer^^Hands of the Enemy^^Claim your reward from Hydraxis' Coffer.^<name>, your services to the Warlords surpassed all we could expect from the denizens of this world. We do not understand your people's notions of gratitude, or rewarding good works, but in this case... perhaps a reward is warranted. Under the surf at the southern base of this island, you will find a coffer. In it you will find your... reward. Go, <name>. Claim your reward.Attunement to the Core^60^Horde^Molten Core^Lothos Riftwaker^Lothos Riftwaker^^^^Venture to the Molten Core entry portal in Blackrock Depths and recover a Core Fragment. Return to Lothos Riftwaker in Blackrock Mountain when you have recovered the Core Fragment.^Rifts stir, tear, and collapse all around us, <race>. Not two paces from where I stand is a tear leading through the depths of Blackrock Mountain, into the maw of the Firelord. Surprised? Pity... The mortal races cannot comprehend that which they cannot see, touch, or feel. I assure you, the portal is there and access is possible. I've piqued your interest? Attunement is simple. Venture into Blackrock Depths and retrieve a core fragment. Return it to me and I shall attune your essence with the portal.Lethtendris's Web^57^Alliance^Dire Maul^Latronicus Moonspear^Latronicus Moonspear^Feathermoon Stronghold^^^Bring Lethtendris' Web to Latronicus Moonspear at the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.^The mage Lethtendris, a vicious blood elf whose brutality is matched only by her twisted addiction to magic, has fled into Dire Maul. She has created a device, a web to ensnare the magical energies of that place and we fear that, if left unchecked, she will cause irreparable damage to our world! Stop her, <name>. Find her and retrieve her web. She is likely near the satyrs in Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul. Bring the web to me so that its power may be released safely back into the wilds...Lethtendris's Web^57^Horde^Dire Maul^Talo Thornhoof^Talo Thornhoof^Camp Mojache^^^Bring Lethtendris's Web to Talo Thornhoof at Camp Mojache in Feralas.^The blood elf Lethtendris has overstepped her bounds. So eager was she to gather magical power that she defied her brethren and created a device of insidious design, a web meant to siphon the tainted magical energies of Dire Maul. Even now she gathers those energies and plans to release them against her enemies. Lethtendris must be stopped. Find her within the Warpwood Quarter of Dire Maul, defeat her and bring her web to me so that it might be returned to more clear-headed blood elves for study.Victory for the Horde^60^Horde^Orgrimmar^Head of Onyxia^ ^Victory for the Horde^^^Take the Head of Onyxia to Thrall in Orgrimmar.^You have accomplished the impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Take her head and present it to your Warchief.Camp Mojache^57^Horde^Dire Maul^Harbinger Balthazad^Talo Thornhoof^Camp Mojache^^^Speak with Talo Thornhoof at Camp Mojache in Feralas.^Talo Thornhoof, a Tauren elder in Feralas, sends a request for aid. He offered few details, but he did say that he needs agents for a matter both delicate... and dire. Serve the Horde, <name>. Go to Camp Mojache in Feralas and speak with Talo.Feathermoon Stronghold^57^Alliance^Dire Maul^Crier Goodman^Latronicus Moonspear^Feathermoon Stronghold^^^Speak with Latronicus Moonspear at the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.^<name>! Your aid is needed in Feralas! An outlaw mage, Lethtendris, has fled to the ancient elven ruins Eldre'thalas, now called Dire Maul. It is believed she has an item of dangerous magical energy which must be recovered. Latronicus Moonspear requests agents to enter Dire Maul and retrieve the item from Lethtendris. Serve the Alliance! Seek out Latronicus at the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.Victory for the Alliance^60^Alliance^Stormwind City^Head of Onyxia^ ^Victory for the Alliance^^^Take the Head of Onyxia to King Varian Wrynn in Stormwind.^You have accomplished the impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Take her head and present it to the King Varian Wrynn.Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery^60^All^Rogue^Garona: A Study on Stealth and Treachery^Lorekeeper Kildrath^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Codex of Defense^60^All^Warrior^Codex of Defense^Lorekeeper Kildrath^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.The Arcanist's Cookbook^60^All^Mage^The Arcanist's Cookbook^Lorekeeper Kildrath^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.The Light and How To Swing It^60^All^Paladin^The Light and How to Swing It^Lorekeeper Mykos^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Harnessing Shadows^60^All^Warlock^Harnessing Shadows^Lorekeeper Mykos^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.The Greatest Race of Hunters^60^All^Hunter^The Greatest Race of Hunters^Lorekeeper Mykos^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Holy Bologna: What the Light Won't Tell You^60^All^Priest^Holy Bologna: What the Light Won't Tell You^Lorekeeper Javon^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Frost Shock and You^60^All^Shaman^Frost Shock and You^Lorekeeper Javon^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.The Emerald Dream...^60^All^Druid^The Emerald Dream^Lorekeeper Javon^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Mor'zul Bloodbringer^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Spackle Thornberry^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^^Rage of Blood^Speak with Mor'zul Bloodbringer at the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes.^<name>, your delvings into the dark arts are deep. Your mastery over otherworldly denizens has grown so strong... perhaps you are ready to bind to you one of the infamous dreadsteeds. The ritual to summon the beast from its home requires great power and resources, but if you desire to dominate that epic mount, then speak with Mor'zul Bloodbringer. He is camped near the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes. Go, <name>. This quest will be perilous, but a Warlock of your stature does not shy from danger!Rage of Blood^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^^Wildeyes^Bring 30 bottles of Raging Beast's Blood to Mor'zul Bloodbringer in the Burning Steppes.^The dreadsteeds dwell on another world, on the fiery Plains of Xoroth, and to bind one of those famed beasts you must invoke powerful glyphs. I can scribe the glyphs on a parchment for you, but first I will need a special ink. In distant Winterspring there dwells a race of owl beasts. Once pure creatures, they were turned mad by the demonic emanations of the Darkwhisper Gorge and now roam the snows in a frenzy. Their blood is what I need to ink your parchment. Bring it to me.Wildeyes^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^^Lord Banehollow, Bell of Dethmoora, Wheel of the Black March, Doomsday Candle^Bring the Case of Blood to Gorzeeki Wildeyes at the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes.^My servant, Gorzeeki, is an alchemist of some skill. He can prepare the ink I will need for your parchment. I gathered together the blood you acquired; take it to Gorzeeki so that he can begin his work.The Prison's Bindings^60^All^Warlock^Daio the Decrepit^Daio the Decrepit^^^The Prison's Casing^Travel to Dire Maul in Feralas and recover 15 Satyr Blood from the Wildspawn Satyr that inhabit the Warpwood Quarter. Return to Daio in the Tainted Scar when this is done.^You must retrieve bindings for the prison of the Doomguard from lesser demons. The blood of the Wildspawn satyr that occupy Dire Maul should do nicely. The coagulated blood will bond the Hederine shards and power the crystal prison.The Prison's Casing^60^All^Warlock^Daio the Decrepit^Daio the Decrepit^^The Prison's Bindings^Suppression^Travel to Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring and recover 5 Tears of the Hederine from the Hederine demons that occupy the gorge. Return to Daio in the Tainted Scar when you have completed this task.^The Hederine demons that occupy the foothills of Mount Hyjal secrete powerful fel poisons, which if left to mature, harden into a dense anti-magic crystal. These crystals have come to be known as Tears of the Hederine. Not even the immense power of a Doomguard could break the walls of a prison constructed from this material. Travel to Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring and recover the Tears.Suppression^60^All^Warlock^Daio the Decrepit^Daio the Decrepit^^The Prison's Casing^^Venture forth into the Tainted Scar and locate a Doomguard Commander.^The prison is ready. Now for the most difficult portion of this task. You must find and capture a Doomguard Commander within the Tainted Scar using this crystal prison. Be warned! A Doomguard is a cunning and lethal adversary and will seek to destroy you as you begin the ritual of imprisonment. It will flail wildly in its attempts to escape imprisonment. It will focus on nothing but you, <name>. Because of this, I must recommend that you take companions capable of keeping you alive!What Niby Commands^50^All^Warlock^Niby the Almighty^Impsy^What Niby Commands^^^Speak with Impsy in Felwood.^If I am to teach you the secrets of summoning an infernal servant, you must destroy Kroshius and bring me the infernal core from his burning remains. This, however, is not as easy as it sounds. Kroshius has all but burned out completely. You must reignite his corpse and raise him from the rubble. To do this, however, you must gather some components from other demonic entities. My imp, Impsy, shall set you on your way.Flawless Fel Essence^50^All^Warlock^Impsy^Impsy^What Niby Commands^^^Impsy in Felwood has asked that you bring him three Flawless Fel Essences originating from three distinct locations.^If you're going to reanimate Kroshius, you're going to need Fel fire. I can make Fel fire but it's going to require some components. You need to bring me flawless Fel essences from three distinct regions of the world. The Legashi Satyrs of Azshara will have the first essence type; the Jaedenar legionnaires of Jaedenar the second type and the felguard sentries of the Blasted Lands the third. Bring me back one of each essence type and I will create the Fel fire, allowing you to reanimate Kroshius.Kroshius' Infernal Core^50^All^Warlock^Impsy^Niby the Almighty^What Niby Commands^^^Search Shatter Scar Vale in Felwood for the remains of Kroshius. When you locate the remains, use the Fel Fire near them and await Kroshius' return. When the infernal has awoken, slay him and take from his corpse Kroshius' Infernal Core.^Kroshius lays in a heap to the northeast, in the Shatter Scar Vale. Take this Fel fire and use it on his remains. The fire should reanimate the fallen infernal. At this point, I fully expect him to kill you and your minion. If by some miracle you happen to kill Kroshius, take his infernal core and return it to Niby.A Binding Contract^60^All^Blackrock Depths^Thorium Brotherhood Contract^Lokhtos Darkbargainer^^^^Turn the Thorium Brotherhood Contract in to Lokhtos Darkbargainer if you would like to receive the plans for Sulfuron.^The undersigned hereby declares that the Sulfuron ingot they are delivering to the Thorium Brotherhood (TB Ltd.) is genuine and not a facsimile thereof. The undersigned also acknowledges that any harm that should come to <him/her> as a result of attempting to build, forge, find, create, sell, or eat Sulfuras, is not the responsibility or fault of TB Ltd. By signing this contract, you are agreeing to all terms listed herein. _________________ SignatureThe Balance of Light and Shadow^60^All^Priest^Eris Havenfire^Eris Havenfire^^^^Save 50 Peasants before 15 are slain. Speak with Eris Havenfire should you accomplish this task.^You must do what I could not: Save the peasants that were cut down while fleeing from Stratholme. They will walk towards the light, you must ensure their survival. Should too many fall, our cursed existence shall continue - you will have failed. Every ability, prayer, and spell that you have learned will be tested. May the Light protect you, <name>.Lord Banehollow^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^Lord Banehollow^Lord Banehollow^Wildeyes^Ulathek the Traitor^Purchase Shadowy Potions from Gorzeeki Wildeyes at the Altar of Storms in the Burning Steppes.^Mor'zul says that you want to open a portal to Xoroth. To do that, you'll need Xorothian stardust. That's not easy to find on Azeroth! There is one being who might have some: Lord Banehollow in Jaedenar, the seat of the Shadow Council! Speak with him and he might part with the stardust. But if you're going to Jaedenar, then you'll need to cloak yourself in the Shadow Council's own flavor of evil. That will require some of my shadowy potions, and that will cost you...Ulathek the Traitor^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Lord Banehollow^Lord Banehollow^Lord Banehollow^^Xorothian Stardust^Confront Ulathek, then bring The Traitor's Heart to Lord Banehollow in Jaedenar.^You wish to enter my good graces? Then kill for me. My servant, Ulathek, is pathetic how he grovels before me, all the while plotting with Lord Hel'nurath on Xoroth. Hel'nurath plans to usurp my power here, and Ulathek is his spy... Prove that you serve me and not my rivals. Confront Ulathek in his quarters, in the Shadow Hold to the west. Tell him that I know his secret and watch as fear grips him. Then, bring me the traitor's heart!Xorothian Stardust^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Lord Banehollow^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^Lord Banehollow^^Imp Delivery^Purchase Xorothian Stardust from Ur'dan inside the Shadow Hold at Jaedenar in Felwood. Bring it to Gorzeeki Wildeyes in the Burning Steppes.^So you come to me seeking Xorothian stardust? You wish to open a portal to Xoroth, the domain of Hel'nurath my rival? Perhaps you plan to steal from him one of his precious dreadsteeds? Very well. My servant Ur'dan has a supply of Xorothian stardust. You may obtain it from him... if you can pay the price.Bell of Dethmoora^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^^Wildeyes^Arcanite^Bring 2 Elixirs of Shadow Power to Gorzeeki Wildeyes in the Burning Steppes.^A Bell of Dethmoora, named after the late warlock Dethmoora Darkeyes, is one of the three tools needed to create a Circle of Greater Summoning. When properly atuned with the Wheel and the Candle, these items conduct vast stores of arcane power. My servant Gorzeeki can construct such a bell, but to do so he will need a large supply of elixirs of shadow power. Procure the elixirs from an alchemist and bring them to Gorzeeki.Wheel of the Black March^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^^Wildeyes^Arcanite^Bring 6 Large Brilliant Shards and 25 Dark Iron Ore to Gorzeeki in the Burning Steppes.^A Wheel of the Black March contains and directs the violent energies required for the Circle of Greater Summoning. For Gozeeki to construct a wheel, he will need both large brilliant shards from an enchanter, and dark iron ore from a master miner. Acquire these and bring them to my servant.Doomsday Candle^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^^Wildeyes^Arcanite^Bring 3 Black Dragonscales to Gorzeeki Wildeyes in the Burning Steppes.^A Doomsday Candle stores fire and directs it at those who would disrupt your ritual. When creating your Circle of Greater Summoning, if your candle is lit then any wayward demons will be burned by its flames! Containing that fire is not easy, and requires the essence within the scales of a black dragon. Acquire those scales from a skinner and bring them to Gorzeeki Wildeyes.Imp Delivery^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^Lord Banehollow^Xorothian Stardust, Arcanite^Dreadsteed of Xoroth^Bring the Imp in a Jar to the alchemy lab in the Scholomance. After the parchment is created, return the jar to Gorzeeki Wildeyes.^There is one more process required for Mor'zul's parchment; I need paper infused with Xorothian stardust. And... I'm afraid I can't do that here. I don't have the equipment! There is an alchemy lab, however, with everything needed. It's in the Scholomance, on the isle of Caer Darrow in the Plaguelands. I can't make the trip, but here - take this jar. There's an imp inside who is quite clever. Let him out at the alchemy lab and he'll infuse the parchment.Arcanite^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^Gorzeeki Wildeyes^^Bell of Dethmoora, Wheel of the Black March, Doomsday Candle^Imp Delivery^Bring 1 Arcanite Bar to Gorzeeki in the Burning Steppes.^Now that the Bell, Wheel and Candle are made, I should make a black lodestone. During your ritual, you'll need that lodestone to maintain the other ritual objects if they should fail. To make the lodestone, I require arcanite. Do you have any? If not, then... you'll have to get the arcanite from an alchemist. Return to me when you have the arcanite, and then I'll make the black lodestone.Dreadsteed of Xoroth^60^Human, Orc,^Warlock^Mor'zul Bloodbringer^Dreadsteed Spirit^^Imp Delivery^^Read Mor'zul's Instructions. Summon a Xorothian Dreadsteed, defeat it, then bind its spirit to you.^All the preparations are made. Now, you must perform the ritual to create a Circle of Greater Summoning, then use the parchment infused with Xorothian stardust... to open a portal to Xoroth. I have written the instructions for the ritual onto a scroll. Study it closely, for you must perform each step exactly if you wish to succeed. Fortune to you, <name>. And may the souls of your enemies swiftly find their way into your shard pouch.The Ancient Leaf^60^All^Hunter^Ancient Petrified Leaf^Vartrus the Ancient^^^Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina, A Proper String, Stave of the Ancients^Find the owner of the Ancient Petrified Leaf. Good luck, <name>; It's a big world.^The epidermis of the leaf glows a bright green. The surface is extremely rugose, exposing several veins and wrinkles. If you had to take a guess, you would say this leaf came from something ancient and powerful. Maybe you should find the original owner of this leaf?Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina^60^All^Hunter^Hastat the Ancient^Hastat the Ancient^^The Ancient Leaf^^Hastat the Ancient has asked that you bring him a Mature Blue Dragon Sinew. Should you find this sinew, return it to Hastat in Felwood.^Greetings, <class>. I am Hastat, Ancient of Lore. I hold knowledge lost eons ago. With the proper binding, one of my leaves can serve as a quiver the likes of which has not been seen in 10,000 years. A quiver that when accompanied by a bow of Ancients, could grant untold powers. Return here with sinew from an adult blue dragon and this quiver shall be yours.A Proper String^60^All^Hunter^Stoma the Ancient^Stoma the Ancient^^The Ancient Leaf^^Stoma the Ancient has asked that you bring him a Mature Black Dragon Sinew. Should you find this sinew, return it to Stoma in Felwood.^Vartrus may offer you the stave to create a bow of Ancients but only I can enchant the string required to complete the bow. It is a simple task, puny one. Slay a mature black dragon and remove the sinew from its bones. Return that sinew to me and I shall enchant the material into an almost indestructible bow string.Stave of the Ancients^60^All^Hunter^Vartrus the Ancient^Vartrus the Ancient^^The Ancient Leaf^^You must find and destroy these four demonic corrupters:^Agents of the Burning Legion are still active in our world, <class>. These agents corrupt all that they touch. Nature wilts and weeps in their presence. You must track down these demonic corrupters and destroy them, <name>. Be warned, you must engage them by yourself or they will flee. As long as you are alone, they will try and destroy you. You must strike at them, turning their arrogance into misery. I grant you a piece of my bark, the inscriptions shall lead you to your targets. Retrieve their heads.Emphasis on Sacrifice^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^High Priest Rohan^Emphasis on Sacrifice^^To Show Due Judgment^Travel to Ironforge and get High Priest Rohan's Exorcism Censer. You will need to make a donation of 150 gold in order to secure it.^In order to prepare yourself for this task, you must first show due sacrifice and judgment... with an emphasis on sacrifice. You must acquire High Priest Rohan's exorcism censer for your task. Even though its use will be for good and just reasons, due compensation must be given for it. Proceed to Ironforge and speak with the High Priest. By bringing ample coin with you to help offset the loss of his censer, it will show your due sacrifice. Go now <name>, time is of the essence.Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Duthorian Rall^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^^^Emphasis on Sacrifice^Speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind's Cathedral District.^The time has come, <name>, for you to learn about what it will take for you to acquire something you have no doubt waited on for some time... your charger. Speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker here in Stormwind's Cathedral District. It is he who will guide you not only though the legerdemain of a Paladin's most trusted mount, but the tasks before you to acquire one of your own. I wish you the best in this trial. For the Light, noble <brother /sister>!To Show Due Judgment^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^High Priest Rohan^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Emphasis on Sacrifice^^Exorcising Terrordale^Return the Exorcism Censer to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in the Cathedral District of Stormwind.^With my blessings, take the censer. I myself have used it in several exorcisms, and it should serve you well for the arduous tasks that lie ahead. Return now to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind, <name>. Your quest continues with him.Exorcising Terrordale^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Emphasis on Sacrifice^^The Work of Grimand Elmore^Use the Exorcism Censer to drive out the spirits that torment Terrordale. When you have slain 25 Terrordale Spirits, return to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in the Cathedral District of Stormwind.^I have added a pinch of dirt from the tainted ground of Terrordale in the Eastern Plaguelands to the censer. You will now use this censer to find areas there that show signs of spiritual turmoil and disturbance. Look for green auras that permeate the ground as the physical world buckles under the torment of the spirit realm and use the censer to drive out the evil spirits. When you have passed sufficient judgment on the spirits there, you will be ready to proceed.The Work of Grimand Elmore^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Grimand Elmore^The Work of Grimand Elmore^Exorcising Terrordale^Collection of Goods^Speak with Grimand Elmore in Stormwind's Dwarven District.^A paladin's charger is nothing more than a pack animal without proper barding for it. The barding used by your charger not only needs to be of the finest materials possible, but because of the circumstances involved it must also be sufficiently attuned to the spirit realm. First things first, <name> - let's get your barding made. In Stormwind's Dwarven District is one of the finest craftsmen living today, Grimand Elmore. His work will not be cheap, but his quality is what we seek.

Actually, you need five things... gold for my fee. That fee includes all labor as well as a handcrafted saddle and stirrups. Once you've got all that, I'll be able to finish your barding. Until then, there are some things I can get started on for you while you assemble your collection of goods.Ancient Equine Spirit^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Ancient Equine Spirit^Ancient Equine Spirit^Collection of Goods^Blessed Arcanite Barding^Acquire special horse feed used for feeding a spirit horse. Merideth Carlson in Southshore apparently is the source for such food.^Your barding needs a special form of blessing, one from an appropriate spirit. In Dire Maul is such a spirit, the Ancient Equine Spirit. It is currently held by a corrupt treant, Tendris Warpwood. Pass judgment upon this foul beast, <name>. Know this - freedom alone is not enough. You must soothe the spirit before receiving its blessing. For that, special horse feed is needed. Travel to Southshore first and speak with Merideth Carlson on this... and prepare for more sacrifice.Blessed Arcanite Barding^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Ancient Equine Spirit^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Ancient Equine Spirit^^The Divination Scryer^Return with the Blessed Arcanite Barding to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in the Cathedral District of Stormwind.^As the barding rests on the back of the Ancient Equine Spirit, it glows ever so slightly. The air is thick with power for a brief moment, and then the barding disappears from the back of the horse and is now secure in your backpack. It would seem that the barding has been blessed. As per Lord Shadowbreaker's instructions, you should now return with it to him in Stormwind.Manna-Enriched Horse Feed^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Merideth Carlson^Merideth Carlson^^^^Retrieve 20 Enriched Manna Biscuits - the key ingredient in making Manna-Enriched Horse Feed - for Merideth Carlson at Southshore in the Hillsbrad Foothills.

EVERYONE thought I was mad! Well, now it's payback time! I'll make what you need, PALADIN... so-called CHAMPION... but it will cost you. I need special biscuits - Enriched Manna Biscuits sold only by the Argent Dawn - for this blend. I also demand, yes DEMAND gold as compensation for the misery I have endured!

Your scryer, actually, is almost done. The exorcism censer used in Terrordale is the catalyst for it, and I will fashion a suitable housing for the device. The last components needed, though, are two diamonds. They must be as juxtaposed in brilliance as they are in purpose - an Azerothian and a Pristine Black. These two will be the beacon by which the scryer will pierce the shadows!Judgment and Redemption^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Darkreaver's Fallen Charger^Ancient Equine Spirit^^Again Into the Great Ossuary^Use the Divination Scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement in the Scholomance.

Defeat him and reclaim the lost soul of the fallen charger.^Take this satchel - in it are the items you will need for your task. Use the divination scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement to bring forth accursed spirits that must be judged. Use your judgments wisely during this trial - they will prove more potent than you realize. After the spirits, the death knight will appear; defeat him and reclaim the lost soul of the charger. Only then <name>, will you be able to redeem it and place your barding upon your new steed! Good luck!Grimand's Finest Work^60^Alliance^Paladin^Grimand Elmore^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^^Collection of Goods^^Take the Arcanite Barding to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind's Cathedral District for his inspection.^<Grimand wipes sweat from his brow, beaming with a sense of pride.> There you are, my friend. This is some of my finest work - as good as the barding I personally made for Lord Shadowbreaker when he went for his own charger. I thank you for your trust in me to provide for you the best. No doubt Grayson will want to see the work for himself as well. Take your barding to him, and give him my thanks for his honorable business.Enchanted Thorium Platemail: Volume I^60^All^Blacksmithing^Enchanted Thorium Platemail^Lorekeeper Lydros^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Enchanted Thorium Platemail: Volume II^60^All^Blacksmithing^Enchanted Thorium Platemail^Lorekeeper Lydros^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Enchanted Thorium Platemail: Volume III^60^All^Blacksmithing^Enchanted Thorium Platemail^Lorekeeper Lydros^^^^Return the book to its rightful owners.^The tome carries the mark of the Athenaeum.Material Assistance^60^Horde^Shaman^Sagorne Creststrider^Sagorne Creststrider^Material Assistance^^^If you are interested in helping Sagorne Crestrider in Orgrimmar's Valley of Wisdom, bring him an Azerothian Diamond and a Pristine Black Diamond.^<name>, there is a pressing matter I hope you can help with... both materially and spiritually. Allow me to explain. Within the depths of the Scholomance in Lordaeron is a chamber called the Great Ossuary. I need to complete a device that would pierce the shadows of this horrid room. To finish what I have started, I need two diamonds: an Azerothian and a Pristine Black. These are not trivial items, I know - I just don't have the resources myself. Could you provide me with one of each?Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^60^Human, Dwarf,^Paladin^Brandur Ironhammer^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^^^Emphasis on Sacrifice^Speak with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in Stormwind's Cathedral District.^The time has come, <name>, for you to learn about what it will take for you to acquire something you have no doubt waited on for some time... your charger.

I'd bet anything that the recipe was part of the deal in his new promotion amongst the Dark Irons. I want you to get our secret plans back, <name>.

While I can't offer nearly as much in the way of compensation again, I'll be more than happy to spread the good word of your service to all my goblin friends with ears.

Did my heroic mission of collecting bits of goo found inside elemental beings not slake your thirst for adventure? Perhaps more of the same will vainly try to fill the bottomless well of questing you possess... OK, melodrama aside, I do need more water elemental cores. I'm trying desperately to set up shop here, so the rewards won't be as great... but I promise you I'll tell everyone in earshot how you've helped me.

Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not if they're sentient. If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls. Drive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.

Not only is it larger, it also seems to secrete some sort of aura that the other insects don't. We've given it a name - Stinglasher. The innards of this beast would be invaluable to study as we figure out the best way to deal with this new threat.

Only those with the Mark of Drakkisath branded upon their hand may make use of this orb. Thankfully, Drakkisath is not nearly as incompetent as you, Quartermaster.

Return to Lothos Riftwaker in Blackrock Mountain when you have recovered the Core Fragment.^Rifts stir, tear, and collapse all around us, <race>.

Find and return Huntsman Malkhor's Skull and Huntsman Malkhor's Bones to Huntsman Markhor.^Like many in our village, I too have lost a loved one to the wilds. Alas, it was my twin brother Malkhor - taken in the same raid as Torntusk's mate by the Vilebranch. Sadly, he was not fated to live and was given a swift, brutal execution; his remains fed to the oozes and wolves of the Vilebranch. It is too late to save his life but not too late to save his soul.

You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^You are a heathen. Heathens have a place in the tribe. Heathens are freethinkers of Zandalar. Freethinkers do not fear oppression. Freethinkers die for what they believe in. We know you would die for what you believe in. This earns our acknowledgement. This earns you a chance to prove yourself further. We must have the Paragons of Power. Go to Zul'Gurub. Kill the minions of Hakkar. Return when you have what I seek. Claim the first battle gear of a Zandalar freethinker. Go.Paragons of Power: The Freethinker's Belt^60^All^Paladin^Jin'rokh the Breaker^Jin'rokh the Breaker^^^^Bring Jin'rokh the Breaker a Primal Hakkari Shawl. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^Your beliefs are alien to us, heathen. Ancient Zandalar were once branded as heretics. This was when the Gurubashi Empire was strong. Heathens dared to challenge the priest of Hakkar. Heathens then were hunted and killed as vermin. Those heathens never wavered in their fight against the Blood God. We honor the price they paid. They are the freethinkers. Destroy the minions of Hakkar in Zul'Gurub. Bring me the Paragons of Power I seek. Success will be greatly rewarded. Go.Paragons of Power: The Freethinker's Breastplate^60^All^Paladin^Jin'rokh the Breaker^Jin'rokh the Breaker^^^^Bring Jin'rokh the Breaker a Primal Hakkari Tabard. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^Battle gear gives you power in the tribe. The freethinkers are honored in this way. They are zealots. They imbue their breastplates with powerful mojo. If their beliefs falter in the face of the enemy, their breastplate will not. You must be revered amongst us to possess such a breastplate. Go to Zul'Gurub. Take the Paragons of Power I need. Take the Paragons most painfully from the fools inside. Bring them to me. Prove your worth as a freethinker once and for all.Paragons of Power: The Augur's Bracers^60^All^Shaman^Maywiki of Zuldazar^Maywiki of Zuldazar^^^^Bring Maywiki of Zuldazar a Primal Hakkari Armsplint. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^The augurs of our tribe are revered for their gifts of the divine sight, ya mon. They ain't a witch doctor; they spend their time castin' bones or readin' the leaves for insight - not hexin' people. As a shaman, you already know somethin' about the power of augury; we Zandalar prize the insight they give to the tribe. Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us. Do this for us, and I'll give ya some bracers that our augurs prize above all others!Paragons of Power: The Haruspex's Bracers^60^All^Druid^Maywiki of Zuldazar^Maywiki of Zuldazar^^^^Bring Maywiki of Zuldazar a Primal Hakkari Stanchion. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^A haruspex is a key member of our tribe; you'll be wise to listen to their portents. By communion with animals and givin' them up to the spirits when needed, they give us divine guidance. In times past, the haruspex's insight and wisdom gave us an edge in the wars against the splintered tribes of the Gurubashi. Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us. Do this, and I'll give ya bracers that any haruspex of the Zandalar would want.Paragons of Power: The Vindicator's Armguards^60^All^Warrior^Jin'rokh the Breaker^Jin'rokh the Breaker^^^^Bring Jin'rokh the Breaker a Primal Hakkari Armsplint. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^Vengeance is power. The Zandalar vindicator is such power. The tribe has many enemies. The vindicator exacts retribution on them. No crime against us is unpunished. The vindicator delivers this punishment. Our enemies fear our vengeance. They should. They forever will.

You will be rewarded.Paragons of Power: The Demoniac's Wraps^60^All^Warlock^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Stanchion. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^Warlocks tread dangerous ground in dealing with demons, but our demoniacs take this one step further. Through an ancient and arcane ritual, they allow a demon to enter their being. Rather than let it possess them though, they enslave the demon from the inside, absorbing the power of the beast for their own command. It is a feat few are ever able to master. For you to learn of the power of the demoniac, I must have Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub. Go there and retrieve that which we seek.Paragons of Power: The Illusionist's Wraps^60^All^Mage^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing Primal Hakkari Bindings. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^Mages in our tribe are known as illusionists. They employ powerful mojo in their incantations, often befuddling and confusing the tribe's enemies! <Al'tabim laughs wickedly.> It is quite the sight to see a powerful illusionist at work, bringing our enemies to their knees from their own madness! For you to know the way of our illusionists, go to Zul'Gurub and bring back to me selected Paragons of Power. For this, I will give you arm wraps our illusionists use to weave their spells.Paragons of Power: The Confessor's Wraps^60^All^Priest^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Stanchion. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^We Zandalar invest power in those who speak with the authority of divinity. Our priests are more than just healers - they are our confessors. Evil comes both from outside threats - such as Hakkar - and from within the tribe. Our confessors act as the judges amongst us, preserving us from the same evil that devoured the Gurubashi from inside itself. Go to Zul'Gurub and bring back the Paragons of Power from the Gurubashi. Learn what it means to be the confessor, and preserve us from evil.Paragons of Power: The Predator's Bracers^60^All^Hunter^Falthir the Sightless^Falthir the Sightless^^^^Bring the following Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub to Falthir the Sightless: A Primal Hakkari Bindings. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^In the dark times after the fall of the Gurubashi Empire, Zandalar predators used their prowess to provide sustenance for the tribe. Hunters claim to be much like our tribe's predators - to seek the hunt is to embody the essence of the predator, yes. Your hunt in Zul'Gurub, however, will show us how you truly rate amongst our finest predators. Bring to me a sampling of the Paragons of Power from within Zul'Gurub. Do so, and you'll take first steps in becoming the penultimate predator.Paragons of Power: The Madcap's Bracers^60^All^Rogue^Falthir the Sightless^Falthir the Sightless^^^^Bring Falthir the Sightless a Primal Hakkari Armsplint. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.^The madcaps of Zandalar are similar to rogues, but above all else they embrace madness... chaos... the unpredictability of existence. A terror to behold on the battlefield, they sowed the seeds of confusion and mayhem amongst our enemies in the savage times after the tribes splintered. We would not be here today without them. Bring to me the Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub that I seek, and I will grant you the first of the madcap's prized armors. Embrace the madness!Paragons of Power: The Haruspex's Belt^60^All^Druid^Maywiki of Zuldazar^Maywiki of Zuldazar^^^^Bring Maywiki of Zuldazar a Primal Hakkari Sash. Maywiki of Zuldazar is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale. You must also be Honored with Zandalar.^We Zandalar know not of druidic ways; nature is to be shaped by our need, not the other way around. Still, a haruspex is the one of us most in tune with nature, and rightly so. To give up the ghost of a beastie is to know what it is to be one of them. That is the real power of nature. Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub, proving yourself to us. Do this, and I'll give ya a powerful item - a belt used by many of the Zandalar's haruspices. Strong mojo, ya mon!Paragons of Power: The Haruspex's Tunic^60^All^Druid^Maywiki of Zuldazar^Maywiki of Zuldazar^^^^Bring Maywiki of Zuldazar a Primal Hakkari Tabard. Maywiki of Zuldazar is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale. You must also be Revered with Zandalar.^The ultimate symbol of a haruspex's power is what they wear, <name>. Of these, the tunic symbolizes the connection between themselves and the divine wisdom they seek. It often weaves parts of the beasties they sacrifice into the tunic; this reminds them of the connection they have to their gifts. Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us. Do this, and a tunic seeping with the true power of a haruspex is yours.Paragons of Power: The Predator's Belt^60^All^Hunter^Falthir the Sightless^Falthir the Sightless^^^^Bring the following Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub to Falthir the Sightless: A Primal Hakkari Shawl. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^A predator knows how to stalk their prey, but a successful one knows how to strike at it once they have closed ranks. You must master both to have any chance of success in Zul'Gurub... and any chance of being like the Zandalar predators. Bring me choice parts of the Paragons of Power from within Zul'Gurub. My reward will be the power that the trinkets yield, while yours will be the Zandalar predator's belt - equipment well worth the trade.Paragons of Power: The Predator's Mantle^60^All^Hunter^Falthir the Sightless^Falthir the Sightless^^^^Bring the following Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub to Falthir the Sightless: A Primal Hakkari Aegis. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^We Zandalar prize what we wear as a symbol of accomplishment. You don't need to be able to see what one wears to be able to sense what emanates from it - power transcends sight. The garments of the Zandalar predator are like this, and most cherished by them is the mantle they wear. It helps to obfuscate them from view... and to make their presence known when they wish it. The Paragons of Power await your retrieval in Zul'Gurub. Bring me what I seek, and the predator's mantle shall be yours.Paragons of Power: The Illusionist's Mantle^60^All^Mage^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Shawl. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^Magic is a raw, primal force to be shaped by those strong enough to do it. Mojo is our extension of this power; one such potent manipulation of it is in the form of illusion. How can one truly hope to win against a foe that is not even really there? We Zandalar know the power of this, and as such illusionists hold a honored place within the tribe. Take the needed Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub - for this, honor from the tribe and a powerful mantle used by our best illusionists will be yours!Paragons of Power: The Illusionist's Robes^60^All^Mage^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Kossack. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^The tribe acknowledges station and power through what we wear. Our vestments are made from the finest of materials, and interwoven with the mojo we use to make us powerful. Illusionists are no exception; their robes are said to embody the essence of illusion in their look. Legend states that their ancient robes never looked the same twice. I will give you an illusionist's robe, <name>... but earn your place of reverence among the tribe first! Bring me the Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub!Paragons of Power: The Confessor's Bindings^60^All^Priest^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Sash. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^Shortly after the fall of the Gurubashi, we Zandalar almost succumbed to a final defeat from evil within our own tribe. It was then that the confessors amongst us arose, preserving the tribe by banishing out those who would destroy their own kind. They not only keep us in tune with the spirits, but they also preserve the flesh. Go forth into Zul'Gurub and witness first hand the depravity of Hakkar and the Gurubashi. Wrest the Paragons of Power that we seek from them; success will be rewarded!Paragons of Power: The Confessor's Mantle^60^All^Priest^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Aegis. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^The confessors of the Zandalar all wear a distinctive mantle, marking them as the preservers of the tribe. These mantles are woven with powerful mojo that aids them in judging those who would threaten our tribe. As a priest, you too must spend your time judging those worthy and not; such a mantle would definitely be a blessing to you. In exchange for fighting Hakkar's minions in Zul'Gurub and bringing me the Paragons of Power I seek, I will give you a mantle worthy of our finest confessors.Paragons of Power: The Madcap's Mantle^60^All^Rogue^Falthir the Sightless^Falthir the Sightless^^^^Bring Falthir the Sightless a Primal Hakkari Girdle. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^One of Zandalar's legendary madcaps was Khar'vaxal the Cracked. Legend states that when facing the enemies of the tribe for the first time, Kar'xavan used his mantle specifically woven with "the weave of madness". His form was shrouded not only by the mantle, but also with the blinding speed of his twin daggers. Madcaps today cherish their mantle as a sign of their place in the tribe. Bring to me the Paragons of Power I seek, and such a mantle will be yours to weave madness unto your own enemies.Paragons of Power: The Madcap's Tunic^60^All^Rogue^Falthir the Sightless^Falthir the Sightless^^^^Bring Falthir the Sightless a Primal Hakkari Aegis. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^My eyes failed me long ago, but I do not miss them. Even in a tribe such as ours - where one's vestments convey station and purpose - the most potent of garb exudes power that simple eyes cannot see. The prized tunic of the Zandalar madcap is no exception, exuding the raw power of chaos and madness that they are able to channel. The Paragons of Power I need lie in Zul'Gurub; bring me what I seek, and I will reward you with your own legendary tunic... one befitting a weaver of madness.Paragons of Power: The Augur's Belt^60^All^Shaman^Maywiki of Zuldazar^Maywiki of Zuldazar^^^^Bring Maywiki of Zuldazar a Primal Hakkari Girdle. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^Augurs know the mojo of the elements, mon. They use it as a means to guide the tribe to glory. In the dark days after the Gurubashi Empire ripped itself up, our augurs led us to our safe haven in the South Seas. They've also led us back here to the Vale, right back to the heart of evil brewin' in Zul'Gurub. Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us. Do it and I'll give ya a belt that our augurs use - one with powerful mojo inside it!Paragons of Power: The Augur's Hauberk^60^All^Shaman^Maywiki of Zuldazar^Maywiki of Zuldazar^^^^Bring Maywiki of Zuldazar a Primal Hakkari Tabard. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^The augurs of the Zandalar all wear a distinctive chest piece called a hauberk. It's fitted with the finest of silks and cloths, interwoven with strong chain. It's a symbol of not only their divinity, but also of their authority, mon. It's never wise to cross one whose life is devoted to speakin' with the spirits... Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us. Do it and I'll give ya one of the finest hauberks our augurs would ever hope to wear!Paragons of Power: The Demoniac's Mantle^60^All^Warlock^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Sash. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^The demoniac seeks to embody power outright, not just possess it. More than one of our demoniacs has lost a fight with a demon; with our enemies threatening us - especially in Zul'Gurub - the power that a demoniac is able to unleash on our foes is worth the sacrifice. Our survival depends on crushing those who would destroy us; the fall of the Gurubashi Empire taught us this. Travel to Zul'Gurub and gain the Paragons of Power we need. Do this, and a valuable demoniac item shall be yours.Paragons of Power: The Demoniac's Robes^60^All^Warlock^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^Al'tabim the All-Seeing^^^^Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Kossack. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.^The ultimate symbol of power amongst the tribe is the garb we wear in battle. A demoniac's robes have fused fine runecloth and devastatingly powerful mojo into a single fabric. The visage of the robe is said to instill fear into the minds of all who see it... especially the demons that the demoniac will eventually dominate. From Zul'Gurub, you must bring me a very specific set of the Paragons of Power. It will be difficult... but your success will assure you of acquiring a robe for yourself.Paragons of Power: The Vindicator's Belt^60^All^Warrior^Jin'rokh the Breaker^Jin'rokh the Breaker^^^^Bring Jin'rokh the Breaker a Primal Hakkari Girdle. You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.^The ultimate vengeance waits within Zul'Gurub. Hakkar must not rise again. Hakkar destroyed the Gurubashi Empire from within. No sacrifice was enough. The trolls are a shadow of former glories. I know this is because of Hakkar. Become the vindicator you were meant to be. Wreak havoc on the minions of evil. Zul'Gurub must taste Zandalar vengeance. Bring me proof in the Paragons of Power. You will receive the vindicator's belt. You will receive real power. Go.Paragons of Power: The Vindicator's Breastplate^60^All^Warrior^Jin'rokh the Breaker^Jin'rokh the Breaker^^^^Bring Jin'rokh the Breaker a Primal Hakkari Kossack.

It is trusted only to those we revere. It is the Zandalar symbol of vengeance. To become a vindicator is to become vengeance. Take the Paragons of Power we need from Zul'Gurub. Bring them to us. We will take the mojo stolen from us. We will make the minions of Hakkar pay. We will reward you with the vindicator's breastplate. Go. Be our vengeance, <name>.Arathi Basin Resources!^55^Alliance^Arathi Basin^Sergeant Maclear^Sergeant Maclear^^^More Resource Crates^Win the battle for Arathi Basin, get an Arathi Resource Crate, and return it to Sergeant Maclear at Refuge Pointe.^War must be fought with soldiers, any soldier will tell you.

There are key areas in the basin that hold essential resources. Metals, weapons, food, lumber - all are needed, and all can be gained there. That is what I want from you, <name>.

I want you to take and hold at least four of the bases in Arathi Basin. If you can do that, then we will not only secure critical resources, we will show the Horde our dominance!

It will not be easy, but if anyone can get it done, it is you.The Battle for Arathi Basin!^55^Horde^Arathi Basin^Deathmaster Dwire^Deathmaster Dwire^^^^Assault the Arathi Basin mine, lumber mill, blacksmith and stable, and then return to Deathmaster Dwire in Hammerfall.^As you no doubt have heard, the League of Arathor is sending large numbers of troops into Arathi Basin.

Capture and control every base you can, win the battle, and return to me with the resources you gain.The Hunter's Charm^52^All^Hunter^Kary Thunderhorn^Ogtinc^REUSE^^^Speak to Ogtinc in Azshara.^Ogtinc of Azshara has sent out a call for seasoned hunters such as yourself. He is a furbolg hunter who has left his tribe to aid the Cenarion Circle. His teachings are meant to enrich the wisdom of others who share his craft, and guide them toward maintaining a balance.

Key points in the area must be held and operated in order to supply our forces with much needed raw materials and supplies. I charge you to assault the points farthest from our Arathi Basin base.

Eager for food and supplies, these Alliance fools are intent to take and control the rich resources there. We must show them that Arathi will never again be a home for humans!

Report back to me when this task is complete.Confront Yeh'kinya^58^All^Tanaris^Prospector Ironboot^Yeh'kinya^^The Final Tablets^The Hand of Rastakhan^Speak with Yeh'kinya.^My delvings into the Mosh'aru Tablets bear grim news, <name>. Hakkar's true form, the god himself, can be born again through the very egg into which you captured him. Yeh'kinya told you it was to contain his evil, but it is to recreate it! The troll has led you astray! Go to Yeh'kinya and demand the egg from him. Pray that it is not too late to stop Hakkar's return!The Hand of Rastakhan^58^All^Tanaris^Prospector Ironboot^Molthor^^Confront Yeh'kinya^^Speak with Molthor in Stranglethorn.^<name>, our worst fears have come. Legend speaks of the Soulflayer ruling the ancient troll world through evil and terror, and his power was absolute. If he cannot be stopped now, then his new reign may spread across all of Azeroth! There is a contingent of Zandalarian trolls who may help us stem this tide of darkness. They have camped on Yojamba Isle, off the coast of Stranglethorn, west of the ruins of Zul'Kunda. Speak with their leader, Molthor, and pray he knows how to defeat Hakkar.The Heart of Hakkar^60^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Heart of Hakkar^Molthor^^^^Bring the Heart of Hakkar to Molthor on Yojamba Isle.^The Heart of Hakkar burns from within. Although the Soulflayer is defeated, the kernel of his power yet remains in this cursed organ.A Collection of Heads^60^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Exzhal^Exzhal^^^^String 5 Channeler's Heads, then return the Collection of Troll Heads to Exzhal on Yojamba Isle.^It is true. Hakkar now dwells in Zul'Gurub, bathing in the power of our gods. Enthralled high priests now channel the energies of our most sacred divinities into the Soulflayer, who will soon have a strength beyond any being of Azeroth. He must be stopped! Take this sacred cord, and string through it the heads of the high priests responsible for channeling our gods' energy. When you have done this, return to me.Nat's Measuring Tape^60^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Battered Tackle Box^Nat Pagle^^^^Return Nat's Measuring Tape to Nat Pagle in Dustwallow Marsh.^Amongst the shattered fishing lures and tackle is a rolled, silken measuring tape. Attached to the tape is a label that reads: "Nat Pagle, Dustwallow Marsh."Wavethrashing^52^All^Hunter^Ogtinc^Ogtinc^REUSE^^^Bring 6 Wavethrasher Scales to Ogtinc in Azshara. Ogtinc resides atop the cliffs northeast the Ruins of Eldarath.^The wavethrasher is an amphibious beast living only here in Azshara. They are powerful and resilient. The tough, reflective scales from a wavethrasher mirror the strength of the hunter. Track and hunt wavethrashers along the coast of Azshara, and bring me their scales.The Green Drake^52^All^Hunter^Ogtinc^Ogtinc^REUSE^^^Bring the Tooth of Morphaz to Ogtinc in Azshara. Ogtinc resides atop the cliffs northeast the Ruins of Eldarath.^Now I set you on a dangerous hunt to slay the green drake, Morphaz, and bring his tooth to me. Morphaz dwells deep in Temple of Atal'Hakkar, the entrance to which lies in Swamp of Sorrows. If you wish to defeat him, you must not go alone. This drake is an enemy of many -- seek others who wish to destroy him. The drake's tooth represents the power a hunter will find in the company of others. Bring it to me and you will have learned much.A Simple Request^52^All^Rogue^Osborne the Night Man^Lord Jorach Ravenholdt^A Simple Request^^^Speak with Lord Jorach Ravenholdt in Ravenholdt Manor.^Lord Jorach Ravenholdt has requested your presence. The matter is secret, and I cannot say any more. Ravenholdt Manor is located in the Hillsbrad Foothills -- look for a path in the mountains northwest of Durnhold Keep.Sealed Azure Bag^52^All^Rogue^Lord Jorach Ravenholdt^Archmage Xylem^A Simple Request^^^Retrieve the Sealed Azure Bag from the Timbermaw Shaman in Azshara. Then take the bag to Archmage Xylem, also found in Azshara.^First things first. What I've lost is a small blue bag, the contents of which are a private matter. Don't bother going after the thieves, because they are already dead. What we do know is the fools couldn't get the bag open. so they sold it to some timbermaw shaman in Azshara as a holy relic. Clever. I need you to travel to Azshara and retrieve it from the shaman through subtlety... or force. Better luck with the first method, I'd wager. Once acquired, take it to Archmage Xylem.Encoded Fragments^52^All^Rogue^Archmage Xylem^Archmage Xylem^A Simple Request^^^Bring 10 Encoded Fragments to Archmage Xylem in Azshara.^Lord Ravenholdt has asked a favor of us both. He wishes to remove the enchantment from this bag. Unfortunately, some of my books on the subject of dispelling were taken recently, only to be destroyed by savages. The remains of my books are still valuable to me. If you can bring me enough of the encoded fragments, I can piece them back together. Your best chance is to kill the beasts of Azshara, since they have a tendency to pick up just about anything.The Azure Key^52^All^Rogue^Archmage Xylem^Lord Jorach Ravenholdt^A Simple Request^^^Return the Azure Key to Lord Jorach Ravenholdt.^It will take some time to decipher the fragments and remove the enchantment. When I am complete, I'll deliver the bag to Lord Ravenholdt personally. There is still the matter of the key, said to be held by a green drake known as Morphaz. The drake has made its home deep in the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, the entrance to which lies in the Swamp of Sorrows. Gather your friends and venture to his lair. Lord Ravenholdt will await your return with the key.A Bijou for Zanza^60^All^Stranglethorn Vale^Vinchaxa^Vinchaxa^^^^Destroy any one of the Hakkari Bijous found in Zul'Gurub at the Altar of Zanza on Yojamba Isle. When done, speak with Vinchaxa nearby.^The destruction of the various Hakkari Bijous is of grave importance to us, so much so that we welcome outsiders of the tribe to do so for themselves! Take any one of the bijous that you find in Zul'Gurub to the Altar of Zanza and destroy it. For this one time alone, I will give you an additional Honor Token from our tribe; this is above and beyond what you would normally receive. Witness for yourself the blessings of Zanza!Magecraft^52^All^Mage^Archmage Shymm^Sanath Lim-yo^^^Magic Dust^Seek out Sanath Lim-yo and gain passage to see Archmage Xylem.^Archmage Xylem has been asking around lately... for someone of your experience. If you wish to seek him out, you can find him in Azshara. His tower is built high atop the cliffs, and the only way up is a teleport spell invoked by his arrogant servant, Sanath Lim-yo. Sanath makes camp below his master's tower. To find him, travel to where Azshara's main road forks at the entrance to the Ruins of Eldarath. From that spot, head directly north until you reach the cliffs.Magic Dust^52^All^Mage^Archmage Xylem^Archmage Xylem^Magic Dust^Magecraft^^Bring 10 Glittering Dust to Archmage Xylem.^The blood elves in Azshara have developed a method for pulverizing the magical items they acquire. This glittering dust they produce differs from the components normally acquired by a disenchantment spell. When I sent my apprentice to trade for the dust, he was killed without hesitation. For that, they must pay. The time for talk is over, <name>. Find the blood elves along the cliffs of Azshara and use more "persuasive" methods to acquire their glittering dust.The Siren's Coral^52^All^Mage^Archmage Xylem^Archmage Xylem^Magic Dust^^^Collect 6 Enchanted Coral and return them to Archmage Xylem.^Take a look around you. The ruins and beaches are overrun with spitelash. Recently, the wretched creatures have learned to recognize the rare components indigenous to Azshara. Specifically, I speak of enchanted coral -- they are drawn to it by reasons unknown to me. Now there is little coral left in the bay, and it is vital to my research. I need you to separate some enchanted coral from the spitelash sirens and bring it to me.Destroy Morphaz^52^All^Mage^Archmage Xylem^Archmage Xylem^Magic Dust^^^Retrieve the Arcane Shard from Morphaz and return to Archmage Xylem.^There is a green drake deep in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar by the name of Morphaz. Years ago, he overwhelmed me in a bold ambush and consumed my apprentice whole. While the loss of an apprentice is not unknown to me, this particular one carried an arcane shard of unsurpassed size and quality. You must gather powerful allies and delve into the temple. Destroy Morphaz and recover the arcane shard from his ageless stomach.Cenarion Aid^52^All^Priest^High Priestess Laurena^Ogtinc^Cenarion Aid^^^Seek out Ogtinc in Azshara.^It is the way of the divine to help those in need. The how is insignificant -- only the why matters. The Cenarion Circle has such a need. Speak with Ogtinc to lend aid to their plight. He resides atop the cliffs to the northeast of the Ruins of Eldarath in Azshara.Of Coursers We Know^52^All^Priest^Ogtinc^Ogtinc^Cenarion Aid^^^Acquire 4 Healthy Courser Glands and bring them to Ogtinc in Azshara. Ogtinc resides atop the cliffs northeast the Ruins of Eldarath.^The mosshoof coursers of Azshara are magnificent animals who once lived in Felwood. They naturally resist disease and poison, and were unaffected by the corruption there. In their ancestral wisdom, they simply chose to leave that sickened place. It saddens my heart, but I must ask you to hunt these mighty beasts for me. Gather four courser glands as the first ingredient for a restorative salve -- a salve we will use to heal Felwood.The Ichor of Undeath^52^All^Priest^Ogtinc^Ogtinc^Cenarion Aid^^^Acquire an Ichor of Undeath for Ogtinc in Azshara. Ogtinc resides atop the cliffs northeast the Ruins of Eldarath.^For this restorative salve, you must use a simple formula: one part poison, two parts cure. You have acquired one cure, now you must gather the poison. Powerful undead, such as the lingering highborne who wander the Ruins of Eldarath, are sometimes so infused with evil that it coalesces into a sickly greenish goo. To the living, this substance is known as ichor of undeath. Due to the potency of this vile element, I require only a single ichor.Blood of Morphaz^52^All^Priest^Ogtinc^Greta Mosshoof^Cenarion Aid^^^Kill Morphaz in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar, and return his blood to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood. The entrance to the sunken temple can be found in the Swamp of Sorrows.^Now the last part, the second cure. The green drake Morphaz is known to be immune to all forms of poison and disease -- many druids died to bring us this information. There is no doubt his blood is potent for our needs. A courier from the Cenarion Circle will take the parts you have already collected while you gather the last. Summon your allies and seek out the drake's lair in the sunken temple of Atal'Hakkar. Bring his blood to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood.The Darkreaver Menace^60^Horde^Shaman^Sagorne Creststrider^Sagorne Creststrider^Material Assistance^^^Use the Divination Scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement in the Scholomance. Doing so will bring forth spirits you must fight. Defeating these spirits will summon forth Death Knight Darkreaver; defeat him.^Death Knight Darkreaver lords over the Great Ossuary in the Scholomance. He threatens to twist the spirit realm to do his own bidding, and he must be stopped! This is where the scryer you helped make comes into play. Use the divination scryer in the heart of the Great Ossuary's basement to call forth Darkreaver's spirit minions. Defeat the spirits and the death knight himself will appear. <name>, bring me his head! Only his demise will reverse the damage done to the spirit realm!Taking Back Silithus^55^Alliance^Ironforge^Cenarion Emissary Jademoon^Windcaller Proudhorn^Taking Back Silithus^^^Talk to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.^Attention, heroes of the Alliance! The silithid menace has been left unchecked for too long. Unfettered by any real opposition, they've been preparing all this time for a large-scale expansion. Cenarion Circle forces are gathering in Silithus to take the fight to these wretched creatures and all able-bodied adventurers are hereby called to join us! Don't wait until it's too late! Aid us in the defense of Azeroth! Report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold for specific instructions!Taking Back Silithus^55^Horde^Orgrimmar^Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof^Windcaller Proudhorn^Taking Back Silithus^^^Talk to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.^Attention, champions of the Horde! There's a threat we've left unchallenged for too long. Tremors in the earth near silithid hives all around Azeroth have alerted us to large movements in their numbers as they prepare for expansion. Cenarion Circle forces are gathering in Silithus to take the fight to the silithid before it's too late! No more shall they defile our lands! All able-bodied combatants are to report to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold! The silithid shall be vanquished!Deadly Desert Venom^55^All^Silithus^Beetix Ficklespragg^Beetix Ficklespragg^^^Noggle's Last Hope^Beetix Ficklespragg at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to gather 8 Stonelash Scorpid Stingers and 8 Sand Skitterer Fangs. Return to her when you have completed the task.^Beetix Ficklespragg at your service! My cousin Noggle makes a living gathering rare herbs for Cenarion Hold alchemists. Or used to, anyway. He came back from his last trip with a strong poison running though his veins. I've managed to slow down the venom, but to fully neutralize it I need poison samples from whatever stung him. Noggle arrived from the north, so I'd bet my shirt stonelash scorpids or sand skitterers did it. Bring me some stingers and fangs and I'll try to make an antidote for him.Noggle's Last Hope^57^All^Silithus^Beetix Ficklespragg^Beetix Ficklespragg^^Deadly Desert Venom^Noggle's Lost Satchel^Beetix Ficklespragg at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to gather 3 Stonelash Pincer Stingers, 3 Stonelash Flayer Stingers and 3 Rock Stalker Fangs.^Blasted! The antidote didn't work. Noggle must've been stung by one of the stronger creatures in the far south. I'm going to need you to go there and get me some more samples, <name>. The good news is that since their poison is stronger I won't require as many. The bad news is that there are more kinds of poisonous creatures crawling around the southern area so you'll have to draw from more sources.The Twilight Lexicon^60^All^Silithus^Hermit Ortell^Hermit Ortell^The Twilight Mystery^^True Believers^Bring the three chapters of the Twilight Lexicon to Hermit Ortell in Silithus.^The Twilight's Hammer are not kind to those that leave their ranks. They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast! Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine! To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon. It's such an important tool that they keep its three chapters in different locations! The officers entrusted with the Lexicon are known as Twilight Keepers. Look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps.Securing the Supply Lines^55^All^Silithus^Windcaller Proudhorn^Windcaller Proudhorn^Taking Back Silithus^^^Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to kill 15 Dredge Strikers.^Cenarion Hold is a location of utmost strategic importance. I'm convinced that while we hold it our victory over the silithid is guaranteed. Provided our influx supplies can be maintained, that is. Desert worms have proven to be more of a threat to our supply caravans than even the silithid themselves. Just this morning, a large shipment of morrowgrain was ravaged by a group of dredge strikers. I need you to thin their numbers to ensure our supplies aren't jeopardized.Stepping Up Security^57^All^Silithus^Windcaller Proudhorn^Windcaller Proudhorn^Taking Back Silithus^^^Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to slay 20 Dredge Crushers.^Your performance has been truly exemplary so far, <name>. Our supply lines are not completely safe yet, however. In the absence of dredge strikers, their larger southern cousins will surely move in to take their place in the north. You'll have to kill quite a few dredge crushers to keep them at bay, but we cannot leave the safety of our supply lines to chance.Noggle's Lost Satchel^58^All^Silithus^Noggle Ficklespragg^Noggle Ficklespragg^^Noggle's Last Hope^^Retrieve Noggle's Satchel from the mountains in the south of Silithus and return it to him at Cenarion Hold.^Where am I? Where's my bag? *gasp* I must've lost it while fleeing from Deathclasp, the giant scorpid. In my rush to escape I walked right into a nest of stonelash flayers. The satchel I was carrying had all sorts of rare reagents in it. Without them, me and Beetix won't be able to make the potions that Cenarion Hold needs. I'm too weak to get up yet, but I can make it worth your while if you bring back my reagents. I ran into Deathclasp in the southern mountain range, behind Bronzebeard's camp.Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands^59^All^Silithus^Wanted Poster: Deathclasp^Vish Kozus^^^^Bring Deathclasp's Pincer to Vish Kozus, Captain of the Guard.^The terrible scorpid, Deathclasp, is believed to have retreated to the southern mountain range in the presence of increased silithid activity. She presents a great threat to patrols and expeditions in the southern regions. Individuals participating in her destruction will be remunerated handsomely. Inquire with Captain Vish Kozus, at the top of the Cenarion Hold Watchtower, regarding a reward.The Twilight Mystery^58^All^Silithus^Geologist Larksbane^Geologist Larksbane^The Twilight Mystery^^^Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to collect 8 Twilight Tablet Fragments.^A camp of Twilight's Hammer cultists once thrived northwest of here. If you were to venture there now, you'd find the area swarming with elementals and nothing but scattered pieces of wood and canvas to mark the spot where the camp was. I've recovered a few fragments of a clay tablet from the site, but I have too few of them to piece together anything useful. See if you can find the remaining tablet fragments so we can shed some light into the Twilight's Hammer presence here in Silithus.The Deserter^59^All^Silithus^Geologist Larksbane^Hermit Ortell^The Twilight Mystery^^^Take the restored tablet to Hermit Ortell in Silithus.^There are rumors of a Twilight's Hammer member called Ortell having deserted his sect. Word has it he hid in the mountains south of Southwind Village, where he lives as a hermit. Perhaps you can enlist his help in deciphering the tablet. Take the restored tablet with you and seek out Ortell.What Tomorrow Brings^60^All^Silithus^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^What Tomorrow Brings^^^Venture to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and find Anachronos, Brood of Nozdormu.^The embrace of death had all but overcome my being when he intervened. He breathed only once upon my maimed body and then waited patiently for the sands of time to cleanse my wounds. "Forever you will remain if you must," he said, and with those words I was bound as a Watcher. Look now to the desert. The second war is upon us. You must seek out the resting place of the Bronze. Venture to the Caverns of Time and see if the master has returned. I must be sure before I am able to proceed.A Terrible Purpose^60^All^Silithus^Hermit Ortell^Commander Mar'alith^The Twilight Mystery^^^Take the Decoded Tablet Parchment to Commander Mar'alith.^Ok, here we are... a pretty valuable chunk of information, I must say! I've seen the Cenarion Circle forces arrive at Silithus. They plan to drive the Twilight's Hammer out, don't they? This will help. Take this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith. Soon the Twilight's Hammer will be vanquished and I will be outside their grasp for good!Only One May Rise^60^All^Blackwing Lair^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^What Tomorrow Brings^^^Return the Head of the Broodlord Lashlayer to Baristolth of the Shifting Sands at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.^There is no time to waste! A hero must be found! The task I give will require an army to complete but only one may rise from the throng of would be champions to take on the burden and responsibility of an ally of the Brood. Within the lair of the Lord of Blackrock is a most cruel beast. The Broodlord Lashlayer guards the Halls of Strife, blocking the way into Nefarian's inner sanctum. Slay the foul aberration and return his head to me. Do this and you may begin the next step of your journey.Arathi Basin Resources!^60^Alliance^Arathi Basin^Sergeant Maclear^Sergeant Maclear^^^More Resource Crates, More Resource Crates^Win the battle for Arathi Basin, get an Arathi Resource Crate, and return it to Sergeant Maclear at Refuge Pointe.^War must be fought with soldiers, any soldier will tell you. They'll also say that a battle fought with poor gear or on an empty stomach is lost before it starts! That is why Arathi Basin is important. There are key areas in the basin that hold essential resources. Metals, weapons, food, lumber - all are needed, and all can be gained there. That is what I want from you, <name>. Enter Arathi Basin, win the battle by holding more bases than the enemy, and return to me with a crate of resources.Cut Arathor Supply Lines^60^Horde^Arathi Basin^Deathstalker Mortis^Deathstalker Mortis^^^More Resource Crates, More Resource Crates^Win the battle for Arathi Basin, get an Arathi Resource Crate, and return it to Deathstalker Mortis at Hammerfall.^The League of Arathor is sparing no expense in their move to retake Arathi. They, and all the races of the Alliance, now stream to this distant region, intent on expanding their hold from Refuge Pointe. We must stop them, and the best means to stop them is to take their supplies. You can help us, <name>. Enter Arathi Basin, known for its rich mines, fertile land and skilled craftsman. Capture and control every base you can, win the battle, and return to me with the resources you gain.The Path of the Righteous^60^All^Silithus^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^What Tomorrow Brings^^The Hand of the Righteous, Anachronos^Collect 200 Silithid Carapace Fragments and return to Baristolth.^The Brood of Nozdormu are naturally distrusting of the lesser races. While it is true that you have proven to me that you have the potential makings of a hero, the time has come to prove this to my master. Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, Hive'Regal: All swarming with activity and all a threat to our existence. Slay silithid at these hives and take from them a fragment of their carapace. When you can carry no more, return to me and I shall strengthen your resolve.The Hand of the Righteous^60^All^Silithus^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^^The Path of the Righteous^^Collect 200 Silithid Carapace Fragments and return to Baristolth.^Choose your deputies wisely, mortal. Each time you return with your task complete, a new deputy you will be allowed to choose. With that said, I require more of the carapace fragments. Waste no time!Anachronos^60^All^Silithus^Baristolth of the Shifting Sands^Anachronos^Anachronos^The Path of the Righteous^^Seek out Anachronos at the Caverns of Time in Tanaris.^It is time, <name>. I must apologize for keeping so much in secret. Enemies abound, even under our very noses. Please, read from this tome and learn. Take the knowledge I give to you and seek out our master.Dearest Natalia^60^All^Silithus^Commander Mar'alith^Commander Mar'alith^Dearest Natalia^^Glyph Chasing, Breaking the Code^Commander Mar'alith at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to question the inhabitants of Bronzebeard's Encampment. You will find Bronzebeard's Encampment south of Cenarion Hold.^My dear Natalia has gone missing. Truth be told, she had been acting strangely for weeks leading up to her disappearance. I had caught her talking to herself when no one was around on more than one occasion. She was adamant that everything was ok and that she must be allowed to continue her research. She was last seen heading to Bronzebeard's camp to the south. My soldiers are spread too thin, <name>. I need you to go to Bronzebeard's camp and question those dwarves.Long Forgotten Memories^60^All^Silithus^Anachronos^Crystalline Tear^Anachronos^^^Locate the Crystalline Tear in Silithus and gaze into its depths.^In the southern desert of Silithus, near the sacred barrier, exists a single crystalline tear. This tear serves as a symbol of the great losses beset upon us during the War of the Shifting Sands. Locate this tear and gaze into its depths to gain enlightenment.Into The Maw of Madness^60^All^Silithus^Commander Mar'alith^Commander Mar'alith^Dearest Natalia^^^Commander Mar'alith at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to find his beloved Natalia. The information that you gathered points to Hive'Regal in the south as being the area in which you may find Mistress Natalia Mar'alith.^I need you to venture into Hive'Regal and find what became of my dearest Natalia, <name>. This will be no easy task for you. Before you dive headlong into the maw of madness, make sure that you go back and speak with those dwarves. They might be able to give you some tips on dealing with the silithid that inhabit that hive. And <name>, if she truly is as mad as they say... do what you must. <Commander Mar'alith turns away from you.>Desert Recipe^57^All^Cooking^Calandrath^Sandy Cookbook^Desert Recipe^^^Look for information about cooking Sandworm Meat at the Twilight's Hammer camp west of Cenarion Hold.^Adapting to life in the desert has been difficult to say the least. Not only do I miss the birds and trees of Auberdine but our food selection is severely limited by this arid environment. I'm trying to learn about desert herbs, but there aren't many. I've seen Twilight's Hammer groups from the camp west of here hunt sandworms for food. Sandworm meat is so bitter though, I can't imagine how they make it palatable. Keep your eyes open if you go to their camp and let me know if you learn anything.Brann Bronzebeard's Lost Letter^60^All^Silithus^Brann Bronzebeard's Lost Letter^Rutgar Glyphshaper^^^^Take Brann Bronzebeard's Letter to Bronzebeard's Encampment in southern Silithus.^To Whom It May Concern: If you're reading this, I'm either dead or soon to be dead. It's hard to say. Most of the crew is dead anyhow. Found information about a Titan. Great battle between him and an Old God. Yes, a bona fide Old God. Found ancient tunnel leading to Ahn'Qiraj. Taking it. Take this letter to my old camp. Make sure my monkey is getting adequate food, water, and hugs. -Brann Bronzebeard, Explorer Extreme P.S. Watch out for crazy Old God worshipping night elf.Glyph Chasing^60^All^Silithus^Rutgar Glyphshaper^Rutgar Glyphshaper^^Dearest Natalia^Unraveling the Mystery^Rutgar Glyphshaper at Bronzebeard's Encampment in Silithus wants you to venture to Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, and Hive'Regal and recover Glyphed Rubbings from the Glyphed Crystals of each hive.^After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals. We must get a rubbing from crystals in all three hives. If we can get those rubbings, we might be able to make sense of this madness. Take this transcription set and hit those hives, <name>. Don't come back until you've gotten copies from each hive.Breaking the Code^60^All^Silithus^Frankal Stonebridge^Frankal Stonebridge^^Dearest Natalia^Unraveling the Mystery^Frankal Stonebridge at Bronzebeard's Encampment in Silithus wants you to recover a Hive'Zora Silithid Brain, Hive'Ashi Silithid Brain, and a Hive'Regal Silithid Brain. Return to Frankal when you have completed this task.^I think I can formulate an elixir that will allow us to more readily decipher the glyphs and language of the silithid and Qiraji! What do I need? Glad you asked! I need brains! More specifically, a brain from each silithid type that inhabit the hives. Bring me brains and Rutgar's work might not be for naught.Sharing the Knowledge^57^All^Cooking^Sandy Cookbook^Calandrath^Desert Recipe^^^Bring the Torn Recipe Page to Calandrath at the inn in Cenarion Hold.^While the recipe for cooking sandworm meat is legible, it contains references to herbs and spices you've never heard of. Calandrath might have enough knowledge of the plants that grow in the desert to make sense of it.Unraveling the Mystery^60^All^Silithus^Rutgar Glyphshaper^Geologist Larksbane^Unraveling the Mystery^Glyph Chasing, Breaking the Code^^Rutgar Glyphshaper at Bronzebeard's Encampment wants you to deliver the Glyphed Crystal Prism to Geologist Larksbane at the Cenarion Hold in Silithus.^We're on the verge of a breakthrough, <name>! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid. Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals. Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold. She might be able to help.The Calling^60^All^Silithus^Geologist Larksbane^Geologist Larksbane^Unraveling the Mystery^^Armaments of War, Armaments of War, Armaments of War, Armaments of War, Armaments of War, Armaments of War, Armaments of War, Armaments of War^Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to recover the Crystal Unlocking Mechanism from the Qiraji Emissary.^The glyphs illustrate an emissary of the Qiraji meeting with three silithid at the bones of a large dragon. Above the glyphs is what I can only assume to be a code of some sort. This code might very well be the key to summoning the emissary. I will create a copy of the glyph code that you must use in the sand at the Bones of Grakkarond. If I am right, the Overlords will come thinking that new data is ready for transmission. Strike them down and confront the emissary. He holds the key to the crystals...Kitchen Assistance^57^All^Cooking^Calandrath^Calandrath^Desert Recipe^^^Calandrath at Cenarion Hold needs a batch of 10 Smoked Desert Dumplings.^That recipe sure will come in handy. I'd better get to work so I can have some smoked desert dumplings ready for today. I could use a hand in making some, I'll make it worth your while.Secret Communication^60^All^Silithus^Bor Wildmane^Bor Wildmane^^^Encrypted Twilight Texts^Bring 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts to Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^Some of the Twilight's Hammer cultists carry around little papers with gibberish written on them. I want you to bring me a stack of them, <class>. I can't figure out what the gibberish means, but that's not the point! These papers are how their different groups communicate secretly. The more texts we take out of circulation, the less they can communicate!Twilight Geolords^60^All^Silithus^Huum Wildmane^Huum Wildmane^Twilight Geolords^^^Kill 10 Twilight Geolords, then return to Huum Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^The Twilight's Hammer, an insane cult bent on destruction, set up camps in Silithus and perform rituals day and night. We do not yet know their plans, but we do think they are somehow linked to the pulsing red crystals spread across the desert. Although their mystery may one day be solved, we must first deal with their immediate threat. Go to their camps to the west and seek out Twilight geolords. They are the heads of these serpents; that is where we must strike!Vyral the Vile^60^All^Silithus^Huum Wildmane^Huum Wildmane^Twilight Geolords^^^Bring Vyral's Signet Ring to Huum Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^We have discovered another base of operations for the Twilight's Hammer. It is called Twilight's Run; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of Silithus. The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat. When you have done this, bring me his signet ring. Fortune to you, <name>. The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed.True Believers^59^All^Silithus^Hermit Ortell^Hermit Ortell^^The Twilight Lexicon^Still Believing^Hermit Ortell wants you to bring him 10 Encrypted Twilight Texts^Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you. My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis. If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the True Believer. Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share. Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members.Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle^1^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Magistrix Erona^Magistrix Erona^^^Unfortunate Measures, Mage Training, Warlock Training, Priest Training, Rogue Training, Hunter Training, Paladin Training^Kill 8 Mana Wyrms; they are located close to the Burning Crystals that are adjacent to the tower and gazebo.^The sooner you begin your education, <name>, the better for us all. There is little room for error, so listen closely. The Burning Crystals - the green floating objects to the west of the Sunspire here - have long been used to power the isle's experimentations. The mana wyrms were their guardians, but the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas has driven them errant from our lack of magical control over them. There is little choice but to thin their numbers for reclamation. Do this, then return to me.Unfortunate Measures^3^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Magistrix Erona^Magistrix Erona^Unfortunate Measures^Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle^^Collect 8 Lynx Collars from slain Springpaw Lynxes and Springpaw Cubs. Return to Magistrix Erona on Sunstrider Isle when you are done.^Your effort has made something clear that, honestly, I wish were not true. The unchecked power of the Burning Crystals has maligned a much larger swath of the isle's natural balance than I thought. We must now take on more unfortunate measures to reclaim control. The nearby lynxes have succumbed to the influence of the crystals, and they must be put down. Bring their collars, <name>, as I may yet be able to fashion a magical restraint to turn some back from being uncontrolled.Report to Lanthan Perilon^3^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Magistrix Erona^Lanthan Perilon^Unfortunate Measures^^^Speak with Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle; he is standing close to the path running west away from the Sunspire.^You are to report to my assistant, Lanthan Perilon. He will instruct you on what needs to be done next. While we here at the Sunspire will continue to rein in the Burning Crystals, you will be focused on a more pressing matter concerning Falthrien Academy. Lanthan will explain fully when you speak to him. Simply walk west of here along the path, and you should see him standing close by. Good luck, <name> - your continued successes shall be rewarded.Mage Training^1^Blood Elf^Mage^Magistrix Erona^Julia Sunstriker^^Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle^Well Watcher Solanian^Speak with Julia Sunstriker - the Mage class trainer - inside the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you. For young mages here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Julia Sunstriker. Speak with Julia and see what training she has available for you. The things she will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you. Julia - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.Solanian's Belongings^4^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Well Watcher Solanian^Well Watcher Solanian^^^^Collect Well Watcher Solanian's Scrying Orb, his Scroll of Scourge Magic, and his Journal. They are found on Sunstrider Isle by the pond, the fountain, and one of the Burning Crystals. Return them to the Well Watcher at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle when you've collected them all.^With all the chaos happening here at the Sunspire, I haven't had a chance to collect my belongings I've left outside at various places on the isle. I must maintain my vigil over the Sunwell here, so I'll ask you to collect them in my stead. I need my scrying orb, my scroll of Scourge magic, and my journal. Use this satchel for some extra space, as my things are rather bulky. Return them to me and I'll give you a little something - you know, for the effort; you can keep the satchel as well!Aurel Goldleaf^60^All^Silithus^Huum Wildmane^Aurel Goldleaf^Aurel Goldleaf^^^Speak with Aurel Goldleaf in Cenarion Hold.^<name>, although we had hoped the Twilight's Hammer's operations in Silithus were slowing... we were, regrettably, mistaken. Through continued forays against the cult, we have learned that an even darker power, the Abyssal Council, controls the Hammer through the arcane wind stones dotted amongst the cult's camps. Your next action, <name>, will be against the Abyssal Council. Speak with the craftsman Aurel Goldleaf, in the eastern section of Cenarion Hold. Her skill will be needed for this next gambit.Dukes of the Council^60^All^Silithus^Aurel Goldleaf^Aurel Goldleaf^Aurel Goldleaf^^Medallion of Station^Bring 1 Large Brilliant Shard and 3 Abyssal Crests to Aurel Goldleaf in Cenarion Hold.^We think it is possible to use a wind stone to ambush a duke of the Abyssal Council. To do this, however, one must commune through the wind stone, and convince the council you are a middle ranked leader of the Twilight's Hammer. Such a gambit requires a replica of the cult's medallion of station. I can create the medallion, but I will need a large brilliant shard, and crests worn by the Abyssal Templar. Bring these to me and I will do the rest.Aggression^4^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Lanthan Perilon^Lanthan Perilon^Unfortunate Measures^^^Kill 7 Tenders and 7 Feral Tenders, and then return to Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle.^Before sending you to the Academy, I want you on another task that needs to be dealt with immediately. Once used to aid us in the gardening of Sunstrider Isle, the bestial tenders now have grown out of our control. Clear them out with due haste, but be warned - their lack of control has made them aggressive. It is such aggression that forces us to put down these once-gentle servants. It doesn't please me to ask you to do such a task, but survival is survival. I'll mourn later.Felendren the Banished^5^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Lanthan Perilon^Lanthan Perilon^Unfortunate Measures^^Aiding the Outrunners^Kill 8 Arcane Wraiths and 2 Tainted Arcane Wraiths, as well as Felendren the Banished; they are located in the Falthrien Academy. Bring Felendren's Head to Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle.^A betrayer of our people resides atop Falthrien Academy to the southwest. Felendren is his name, and he was banished from blood elf lands for failing to heed the warnings of our teachers and elders. He is the worst of our society, as he lives only to feed his insatiable magical addictions. He refused to learn control; he is a shell of his former self - one of the Wretched - and he is a threat to the Sunspire. Destroy him and the wraiths he uses as minions.A Fistful of Slivers^4^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Arcanist Ithanas^Arcanist Ithanas^^^^Collect 6 Arcane Slivers from any creature on the isle that uses mana, and then return to Arcanist Ithanas on Sunstrider Isle.^It's a shame that we've lost control of many of the creatures here on the island. This was once a tranquil place of study and research. Now it's all we can do to keep from being attacked by our own creations! I'm going to offer you a chance to receive a magical boon in exchange for some collecting work on your part. Bring me a stack of arcane slivers that are found on the mana-using creatures of Sunstrider Isle, and I will cast a spell on you that should aid your adventures on the isle.Tainted Arcane Sliver^4^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Tainted Arcane Sliver^Arcanist Helion^^^^Bring the Tainted Arcane Sliver to Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^You've found an odd sliver of crystallized mana on the corpse of the tainted arcane wraith. The sliver is different than others you may have seen in that it is as dark and sinister-looking as the wraith you looted it from. Just holding it gives you a sense of unnatural foreboding. Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle just might be someone who would have a use for the sliver.Lords of the Council^60^All^Silithus^Aurel Goldleaf^Aurel Goldleaf^Goldleaf's Discovery^^Twilight Ring of Lordship^Bring 5 Large Brilliant Shards and 3 Abyssal Signets to Aurel Goldleaf in Cenarion Hold.^Lords of the Abyssal Council can only be summoned through the greater wind stones, and only the top ranking members of the Twilight's Council may speak to them. But... I have found a way to upgrade your disguise and fool the Abyssal Lords! The disguise calls for a ring of lordship, worn only by the highest members of the cult. I will craft one for you if you can bring me large brilliant shards and abyssal signets.Goldleaf's Discovery^60^All^Silithus^Huum Wildmane^Aurel Goldleaf^Goldleaf's Discovery^^^Speak with Aurel Goldleaf in Cenarion Hold.^<name>, Aurel Goldleaf thinks she's found a way to summon and defeat a ruling member of the Abyssal Council! Such a task will be dangerous, but you have earned great respect amongst the Cenarion Circle. We know that if anyone can do it, you can. May fortune go with you, <name>. Speak with Aurel when you are ready.The Shrine of Dath'Remar^4^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Well Watcher Solanian^Well Watcher Solanian^^^^Read the plaque on the Shrine of Dath'Remar and then return to Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^Day after day I stand here, watching, waiting. I've been accused of dwelling too much on our past, while my eyes look to the horizon. But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so. Dath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king. He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom. Seek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor.Thirst Unending^3^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Arcanist Helion^Arcanist Helion^^^^Use your Arcane Torrent racial ability on a Mana Wyrm, then return to Arcanist Helion.^If there is only one lesson you deign to remember from your time on Sunstrider Isle, let it be this - control your thirst for magic. It is a thirst unending, <name> - what you absorb must be controlled and released via Arcane Torrent. Failure is to become one of the Wretched... hopelessly addicted and insane. Seek out a mana wyrm and unleash your Arcane Torrent upon it. Learn to master your power. When you have sufficiently released an Arcane Torrent, return to me.Aiding the Outrunners^5^Blood Elf^Eversong Woods^Lanthan Perilon^Outrunner Alarion^Aiding the Outrunners^Felendren the Banished^^Speak with Outrunner Alarion near the bridge leading south of Sunstrider Isle.^Magistrix Erona wanted you to head over to Silvermoon City in order to aid our reclamation efforts there... that is, once you had successfully addressed the situation at Falthrien Academy. You did not disappoint us, <name>. On your way to Falconwing Square, south of here, you should speak with Outrunner Alarion. She's not far from the bridge. The Outrunners take care of shuttling goods between here and the mainland, and since you've proven to be so resourceful, they could use your assistance.Signet of the Dukes^60^All^Silithus^Bor Wildmane^Bor Wildmane^Aurel Goldleaf^^Abyssal Signets^Bring the Abyssal Signet to Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^Huum tells me you've figured out how to summon the Abyssal Dukes! That's quite an accomplishment. You know what else would be quite the accomplishment? Smashing up one of those things really good. That'll cause an impression on their underlings, if you know what I mean. Bring back its signet as proof of the deed.Bor Wildmane^60^All^Silithus^Aurel Goldleaf^Bor Wildmane^Aurel Goldleaf^^^Speak with Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^Now that you have a medallion and can summon an Abyssal Duke, speak with Bor Wildmane. He will set you on a task against the Abyssal Council. Good luck, <name>. And if you ever need more medallions, return to me.Completing the Delivery^5^Horde^Eversong Woods^Outrunner Alarion^Innkeeper Delaniel^^Package Recovery^^Deliver Erona's Package to Innkeeper Delaniel inside the inn at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.^The death of another outrunner is a true tragedy, but it's a risk we all accept when we take the job. Magistrix Erona at the Sunspire needs to get this package to the inn at Falconwing Square, and she needs it there as soon as possible. We're short handed and I don't have anyone else available that can cover for us. I'm not going to lie to you; the path to Falconwing Square can be extremely dangerous if you leave the safety of Dawning Lane. Do you feel up to the task, <name>?Bor Wishes to Speak^60^All^Silithus^Aurel Goldleaf^Bor Wildmane^Goldleaf's Discovery^^^Speak with Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^Now that you can disguise yourself as a ruling member of the Twilight Council, I am certain Bor Wildmane will want to speak with you. Go see him, and prepare yourself for a very difficult mission...Scepter of the Council^60^All^Silithus^Bor Wildmane^Bor Wildmane^Goldleaf's Discovery^^Abyssal Scepters^Bring an Abyssal Scepter to Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold.^Huum and I were just talking about you. He tells me you're just about ready to try your hand at fighting an Abyssal Lord! I must tell you this is a very dangerous endeavor. You'd better bring backup. And I don't mean one or two of your friends, I'm talking about a top-notch, battle-ready fighting force. If your friends are as good as you, you might even defeat it! If you do - and I'll want evidence, as always - I'll give you a truly great reward.Abyssal Contacts^60^All^Silithus^Bor Wildmane^Bor Wildmane^^^Abyssal Crests^Bor Wildmane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to destroy an Abyssal Templar and bring him an Abyssal Crest as proof of the deed.^We've seen the Twilight's Hammer cultists performing rituals to summon powerful elemental nobles. We don't know if these are the beings the cultists worship or if they act as intermediaries to even more powerful forces. One thing is for sure: they are receiving orders from these elementals. I want you to find a way to contact an Abyssal Templar and give it a proper beating! Nothing throws the troops in disarray like taking out the chain of command. Bring back proof while you're at it.Pirate Hats Ahoy!^45^All^Tanaris^Haughty Modiste^Haughty Modiste^^^^Haughty Modiste wants you to collect 20 Southsea Pirate Hats and return them to her at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris.^You're the help the Cartel sent? I suppose you'll do. Listen carefully <class>. As you know, I am a procurer of fashionable apparel for the elite of Azerothian society. Kings and Queens, Warchiefs and, well whatever the Horde calls their queens, all wear what I choose is in style. And they pay through the nose for it, which is the best part. So here's what's going to happen. You head down to Lost Rigger Cove and acquire a lot of pirate hats by whatever means. Do you think you can handle that?Southsea Shakedown^45^All^Tanaris^Security Chief Bilgewhizzle^Security Chief Bilgewhizzle^^^^Security Chief Bilgewhizzle of Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris wants you to kill 10 Southsea Pirates, 10 Southsea Freebooters, 10 Southsea Dock Workers and 10 Southsea Swashbucklers.^Argh! They want the impossible from me! The Steamwheedle Cartel wants me to teach the Southsea pirates a lesson. The problem is that I can't be in two places at once; I need to stay here to keep the peace. Of late, the pirates have been disregarding the protection money that the cartel regularly forks over. So I'd like to temporarily deputize you to go down there and show them what for. You'll find them at Lost Rigger Cove, which is not too far to the south. Thanks <name>, I'll owe you one!Elemental Mastery^52^All^Shaman^Haromm^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^Elemental Mastery^^^Collect a sample of air, fire, earth and water for Bath'rah the Windwatcher.^Bath'rah the Windwatcher has sent out a summons for a shaman of your wisdom. He requests you bring a sample of each of the elements to show you are ready. To find Bath'rah, go to the river east of Tarren Mill. Follow the river north until you come across the ruins where Bath'rah resides.Spirit Totem^52^All^Shaman^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^Elemental Mastery^^Da Voodoo^Bring the pieces for the spirit totem to Bath'rah the Windwatcher.^The elemental spirits of this place don't be likin' me any more. You know about the totems more than any, and I be needin' a spirit totem to protect me. We already got the elements, now we need somethin' more with more nature. More primal. In the Western Plaguelands you can kill bears for claws and spiders for their eyes. The carrion birds eat everything, so they might have either one.Da Voodoo^52^All^Shaman^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^Bath'rah the Windwatcher^^Spirit Totem^^Bring the voodoo feathers to Bath'rah the Windwatcher.^The spirit totem just isn't enough. We be needin' some voodoo magic to make it work jus' right. The trolls in the sunken temple have feathers strong with voodoo magics. Go there and kill Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro. Then we have magic enough for a real spirit totem.Dispelling Evil^52^Alliance^Paladin^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^High Priest Thel'danis^Chillwind Camp^^Inert Scourgestones^Collect 20 Minion's Scourgestones and bring them to High Priest Thel'danis in the Western Plaguelands.^Greetings, <class>. Crusaders like you are a welcome sight in these desolate reaches. Your holy strength is needed to help fight the endless undead here. We need you to collect a large number of scourgestones and bring them to High Priest Thel'danis. The high priest can be found guarding Uther's Tomb in Sorrow Hill, not far from here. Only one with an Argent Dawn Commission can hope to find scourgestones, so speak to Officer Pureheart if you haven't already.Chillwind Camp^52^Alliance^Paladin^Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Chillwind Camp^^^Speak to Commander Ashlam Valorfist at Chillwind Camp.^Commander Ashlam Valorfist has sent out a call for a paladin of your purity and valor, <name>. You can find him at Chillwind Camp in the southern part of the Western Plaguelands. Seek him and aid in his cause for the Light!Inert Scourgestones^52^Alliance^Paladin^High Priest Thel'danis^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Inert Scourgestones^Dispelling Evil^^Bring the Inert Scourgestone to Commander Ashlan Valorfist in Chillwind Point.^The evil has been purged from the stones, <name>. I am aware of Commander Ashlam's plans, and he will require only a single inert stone. Bring it to him so we may bathe the Scourge in righteous fire.A Troubled Spirit^52^All^Warrior^Torm Ragetotem^Fallen Hero of the Horde^A Troubled Spirit^^^Speak with the Fallen Hero of the Horde at the entrance to the Blasted Lands.^In the Blasted Lands, there is a troubled spirit who was once a great hero of the horde. A warrior's honor does not die with the body, and it would serve you well to speak with him.Forging the Mightstone^52^Alliance^Paladin^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^Inert Scourgestones^^^Collect Amber, Blue, and Green Voodoo Feathers from the trolls of Sunken Temple.^Now we must combine the inert scourgestones and create a weapon to shatter the ranks of undead. This is no trivial task, <name>. Only the trolls of the sunken temple carry the kind of rare magic able to turn the evil of something against itself. In the temple, the trolls are known as Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro. Do not feel remorse for their corrupt souls... they are not without evil.An Imp's Request^52^All^Warlock^Demisette Cloyce^Impsy^An Imp's Request^^The Wrong Stuff^Bring a piece of felcloth to Impsy in Felwood.^<name>, an imp in Felwood by the name of Impsy has requested your presence. It is somewhat strange, as he has asked that you bring a piece of felcloth as a sign of good faith. Considering the power you already wield as a warlock, I can only assume you know the satyrs of Felwood carry this felcloth. You can find Impsy just north of the Bloodvenom Falls, which I've heard is quite lovely this time of year.Hot and Itchy^52^All^Warlock^Impsy^Impsy^Hot and Itchy^^The Wrong Stuff^Bring a piece of felcloth to Impsy in Felwood.^Maybe this sounds strange coming from an imp, but I'd like a pet of my own. I really would. It's just not fair that Niby gets me and I get nothing! In fact, it doesn't even need to be a living pet. I'd need something to start making it with, like some felcloth. The satyrs here in Felwood sometimes have felcloth, so you'd just have to kill enough of them until you find some. That doesn't sound so bad, does it?The Wrong Stuff^52^All^Warlock^Impsy^Impsy^An Imp's Request^^^Bring 10 Rotting Wood and 4 Bloodvenom Essence to Impsy in Felwood.^Now that I have my felcloth, I can really begin making *my* pet. It's going to need some eyes though. Perhaps you could rip some rotting wood from the irontree folk for me, so I can carve out some lovely eyes. They're up north in the Irontree Woods. I'll also need some bloodvenom essence to give it that new demon smell. The tainted oozes carry the essence, and they hang out right here near Niby and me.Trolls of a Feather^52^All^Warlock^Impsy^Impsy^An Imp's Request^^^Bring a total of 6 Voodoo Feathers from the trolls in sunken temple.^My pet is almost done. Now I just need something to stuff it with. Only the voodoo feathers from the trolls in the sunken temple will do. They go by the names Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro. Kill them. Kill them all. This is no trivial task <name>, so I'll make it worth your while by giving you something of Niby's -- he probably doesn't need it anyhow.Warrior Kinship^52^All^Warrior^Fallen Hero of the Horde^Fallen Hero of the Horde^A Troubled Spirit^^^Kill 7 Helboar in the Blasted Lands and return to the Fallen Hero of the Horde.^<The Hero looks you over.> You are a <class>, no doubt. I would ask an honorable task of you, but I must test your strength. It is said that Rexxar would measure the sharpness of his blades by killing a helboar with a single, swift strike. Now I will measure your strength by killing them.War on the Shadowsworn^52^All^Warrior^Fallen Hero of the Horde^Fallen Hero of the Horde^A Troubled Spirit^^^Slaughter the Shadowsworn in the Blasted Lands and return to the Fallen Hero of the Horde.^The continued presence of the shadowsworn in the Blasted Lands bring great pain to me. Their dark rituals and spells cause agony unlike any I felt while alive. Through you I can deliver my own message of pain. Go forth and deliver my wrath.Voodoo Feathers^52^All^Warrior^Fallen Hero of the Horde^Fallen Hero of the Horde^A Troubled Spirit^^^Bring the Voodoo Feathers from the trolls in the Sunken Temple to the Fallen Hero of the Horde.^Your honor has brought some peace to me. It is only right that I offer you something in return. My weapons and armor were splendid in life, and yet they are of no use to me now. They would be better served in your possession. Travel to the sunken temple and destroy the troll guardians Gasher, Mijan, Zolo, Hukku, Zul'lor, and Loro. They carry magic feathers that can reform my physical body long enough to grant you a reward.Shrouded in Nightmare^60^All^Epic^Nightmare Engulfed Object^Keeper Remulos^Shrouded in Nightmare^^^Find someone capable of deciphering the meaning behind the Nightmare Engulfed Object.^Corruption seeps from this object. There may be a link between this object and the dragons coming forth from the Dream. You must find someone that can decipher the meaning of this item. Perhaps the druids of the Moonglade or Cenarion Hold could assist you further.Waking Legends^60^All^Epic^Keeper Remulos^Keeper Remulos^Shrouded in Nightmare^^^Wait for Keeper Remulos at the Moonglade to cleanse the Nightmare Engulfed Object.^The waters of Lake Elune'ara should dissolve the nightmares engulfing this object. Give me a moment to perform the cleansing, <name>.Timbermaw Ally^48^All^Felwood^Grazle^Grazle^^^Timbermaw Ally, Speak to Nafien, Feathers for Grazle, Feathers for Nafien^Grazle wants you to prove yourself by killing 6 Deadwood Warriors, 6 Deadwood Pathfinders, and 6 Deadwood Gardeners. Return to him in southern Felwood near the Emerald Sanctuary when you are done.^The Timbermaw are the only furbolg tribe to escape the corruption. However, many other races kill furbolg blindly now, without bothering to see if they are friend or foe. For this reason, the Timbermaw furbolg trust very few. Are you interested in proving yourself? Drive back the corrupted Deadwood tribe of Felwood and we may one day consider you an ally. You'll find the first Deadwood tribe - warriors, pathfinders and gardeners - to my west.Deadwood of the North^55^All^Felwood^Nafien^Nafien^^^^Nafien would like you to kill 6 Deadwood Den Watchers, 6 Deadwood Avengers, and 6 Deadwood Shamans. Return to him in northern Felwood near the entrance to Timbermaw Hold.^There is a camp of Deadwood furbolgs directly to our southwest. Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem. The Deadwood tribe is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds. Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped. It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren. Please, <name> - I ask you to do what must be done. Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much.Speak to Nafien^55^All^Felwood^Grazle^Nafien^^Timbermaw Ally^^Travel north along the main road in Felwood and speak with the furbolg named Nafien. He stands guard outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold.^Perhaps you are capable of handling a larger threat that we Timbermaw face. You certainly have shown yourself capable here... Another of my kind stands guard outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold, along this road far to the north. His name is Nafien; while he may appear to be a feral and unsavory beast, fear him not. He only seeks aid against the malign forces that threaten our home.Unstable Mana Crystals^5^Horde^Eversong Woods^Aeldon Sunbrand^Aeldon Sunbrand^Report to Aeldon Sunbrand^^^Bring back 6 Unstable Mana Crystals to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square.^A group of Wretched recently raided a supply of unstable mana crystals from one of our arcane sanctums. If not handled properly, the crystals could explode with enough force to blow a hole into the city walls. Now, <name>, I don't quite care if they blow themselves up while tapping unstable arcane sources, but the whole incident would make my men look bad. Bring me back any remaining stolen crystals you find; they might still be inside their original crates.Winterfall Activity^58^All^Winterspring^Salfa^Salfa^^^Beads for Salfa^Salfa wants you to kill 8 Winterfall Shaman, 8 Winterfall Den Watchers, and 8 Winterfall Ursa. Salfa is located just outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold in Winterspring.^The Timbermaw tend to stay to themselves, <name>. While we do allow safe passage to those we trust, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible. The Winterfall tribe as of late has become increasingly hostile towards us. They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand. I must ask you to thin their numbers as to lessen the threat against us. Seek them out in Winterfall Village, far to the east of here.Speak to Salfa^55^All^Felwood^Nafien^Salfa^^^^Travel through Timbermaw Hold and exit into Winterspring. Speak with Salfa, who stands guard outside the entrance to Timbermaw Hold.^The threat of corruption comes not only from the Deadwood furbolgs to the south, but also from the east and the Winterfall furbolgs of Winterspring. If you wish to further aid us, speak with Salfa on the other side of the Hold, by the Winterspring entrance. Follow the path to the left to reach it. Be warned - if my kind inside considers you hostile or hated, they will attack. Travel as quick as you can, avoiding conflict. To kill a Timbermaw - even in self defense - will only alienate you further.Wanted: Thaelis the Hungerer^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Wanted: Thaelis the Hungerer^Sergeant Kan'ren^^^^Bring Thaelis's Head to Sergeant Kan'ren at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.^The city of Silvermoon hereby issues a reward for the head of Thaelis the Hungerer, notorious Wretched ringleader. He is wanted for repeated crimes against the general populace of Silvermoon City, including the murder of two city guards. Report to Sergeant Kan'ren to collect the reward.Deadwood Ritual Totem^55^All^Felwood^Deadwood Ritual Totem^Kernda^^^^Take the Deadwood Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item. The Timbermaw will not speak with you unless you are of Neutral reputation or greater with them.^You have found one of the Deadwood furbolg's ritual totems. The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but a palpable sense of despair emanates from it. If there were any object that might best exemplify the corruption that the Deadwood furbolg suffer under, this item would clearly be it. One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you.Winterfall Ritual Totem^56^All^Winterspring^Winterfall Ritual Totem^Kernda^^^^Take the Winterfall Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item. The Timbermaw will not speak with you unless you are of Neutral reputation or greater with them.^You have found one of the Winterfall furbolg's ritual totems. The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but it seems to emanate an almost tangible sense of dread and despair. If many of the Winterfall furbolgs do indeed carry these, it certainly would go a long way in explaining their current condition. One of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you.Major Malfunction^5^Horde^Eversong Woods^Magister Jaronis^Magister Jaronis^Major Malfunction^^^Collect 6 Arcane Cores from the Arcane Patrollers that roam the ruins of Silvermoon City and bring them to Magister Jaronis at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.^The arcane patrollers crafted by our forefathers to protect the city have fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair. They fail to recognize us as their masters and will attack us on sight! Even though they were created many years ago, the arcane cores that power them are still quite useful and valuable to us. I want you to gather these cores and bring them to me so I can put them to good use again. You will find the patrollers in the ruined section of Silvermoon, to the northwest.A Somber Task^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Larianna Riverwind^Larianna Riverwind^The Scorched Grove^^^Slay 10 Withered Green Keepers at the Scorched Grove. Then report back to Larianna Riverwind inside the tower just to the northwest of the Scorched Grove in Eversong Woods.^These are difficult times for us, <name>. It was a very hard decision to burn the woods bordering the Ghostlands to prevent the Scourge's expansion. The treants, who have been our friends for years, are now trying to foster the regrowth of the forest along the Scorched Grove. This is a painful thing to ask of you, <class>, but we've failed to convince our former allies to cease their endeavors. I need you to stop them by the only means that remain to us: force.Old Whitebark's Pendant^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Old Whitebark's Pendant^Larianna Riverwind^Old Whitebark's Pendant^^^Find the person who might have made Old Whitebark's Pendant. They might provide some insight on the item.^The pendant has the initials L.R. etched on to it. Perhaps these letters will lead to the pendant's maker.The Dead Scar^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ranger Jaela^Ranger Jaela^^^^Slay 8 Plaguebone Pillagers and report back to Ranger Jaela on the Dead Scar in Eversong Woods.^The black swath of soil that cuts through Eversong Woods is a permanent reminder of the day Arthas led the Scourge into our beloved city. This blemish is more than an eyesore as even today it brings Scourge from the Ghostlands to Silvermoon. Go, <name>, and give my men a hand in killing the mindless undead that walk down the Dead Scar.Amani Encroachment^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Farstrider Retreat^^^Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods wants you to kill 5 Amani Berserkers and 5 Amani Axe Throwers.^Ours are not the vast kingdoms of the humans and orcs. All we have left of our lands in Azeroth lies mostly before your eyes, <name>. Until we can reach Outland, we must defend what little land we have at any cost. Our uncivilized neighbors to the southeast, the Amani trolls, certainly have a different opinion regarding the ownership of these lands. Their daily raids are something we can't tolerate anymore. Go to their settlements, Zeb'Watha and Tor'Watha, and teach them a lesson.The Spearcrafter's Hammer^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Arathel Sunforge^Arathel Sunforge^^^^Search Tor'Watha to the southeast of the Farstrider Retreat for Spearcrafter Otembe and bring Otembe's Hammer to Arathel Sunforge at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods.^The Amani and the sin'dorei have a long history of mutual dislike and open hostility. That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, <name>. I've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work. It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency. If you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon.Zul'Marosh^11^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ven'jashi^Ven'jashi^^^^Ven'jashi, the troll prisoner at Tor'Watha, wants you to bring him Chieftain Zul'Marosh's Head. Chieftain Zul'Marosh can be found in Zeb'Watha, across Lake Elrendar.^Come closer, mon. Don't be 'fraid, Ven'jashi not gonna hurt you. Us Darkspears be mortal enemies of the Amani just like you. Their boss Zul'Marosh is evil troll. He give me the bad poison and leave me in this cage to die. I not scared of dyin', mon. I seen death in the eye an' I laugh at her. I cannot die in peace yet, mon. Not 'til Zul'Marosh be dead too. You find him 'cross the lake in Zeb'Watha. I hold this poison off 'til you bring me his big ugly head, mon. Only then I die peacefully.Lost Armaments^7^Horde^Eversong Woods^Velendris Whitemorn^Velendris Whitemorn^Lost Armaments^^^Bring 8 Sin'dorei Armaments to Velendris Whitemorn in Eversong Woods.^The Wretched grow bolder every day, <name>. They've achieved enough coordination to launch an attack on Sunsail Anchorage. As if that weren't embarrassing enough, most of our weapons were left behind when they attacked. Bring me back our armaments so that we may show those ruffians who's boss.The Root of All Evil^60^All^Felwood^Gorn One Eye^Gorn One Eye^^^^Plant the Demon Summoning Torch in the mouth of High Chief Winterfall's cave in the Winterfall furbolg village. Defeat the demon and retrieve the Essence of Xandivious for Gorn One Eye in Timbermaw Hold.^<name>, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the Winterfall tribe - the corrupting demon that dominates them! Take this torch to the mouth of High Chief Winterfall's personal cave and plant it there. Doing so will force the demon to reveal itself and investigate. This is when you and your allies must strike it down! Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe... and the salvation of Timbermaw Hold.Incriminating Documents^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Incriminating Documents^Aeldon Sunbrand^Incriminating Documents^^^Bring the Incriminating Documents to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.^The documents contain detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods. A diagram of an arcane sanctum is also sketched in good detail. There seem to be numerous notes in a language you don't recognize. As these were carried by a Darnassian spy, it might be a good idea to bring them to the Captain of the Guard - Aeldon Sunbrand.The Dwarven Spy^7^Horde^Eversong Woods^Aeldon Sunbrand^Aeldon Sunbrand^Incriminating Documents^^Fairbreeze Village^Bring Prospector Anvilward's Head to Aeldon Sunbrand at Falconwing Square in Eversong Woods.^Listen, <name>. This is a very delicate situation; even though we've identified the spy, we cannot kill him out in the open. We cannot try to capture him either as the risk of him escaping is too great. I want you to go find Prospector Anvilward at the North Sanctum and kill him. Do this in a quiet manner, we don't want word to spread that we allowed a spy into our city. Bring me his head as proof. Ironforge will learn not to meddle with the sin'dorei.The Brokering of Peace^60^Alliance^Ironforge^Gorn One Eye^King Magni Bronzebeard^^^^Bring the Timbermaw Offering of Peace to King Magni Bronzebeard in Ironforge.^Your deeds go beyond the tale of a simple hero, <name>. If you are a representative of your people, then your people are ones we would work to make peace with. Please - take this offering to the dwarven king that resides in a mountain of iron; I believe you call this city Ironforge. In times past, he had tried to make contact with us on behalf of his Alliance. It is now only fitting to acknowledge you as the key in your Alliance's efforts in brokering peace.The Brokering of Peace^60^Horde^Orgrimmar^Gorn One Eye^Thrall^^^^Bring the Timbermaw Offering of Peace to Thrall in Orgrimmar.^Your deeds go beyond the tale of a simple hero, <name>. If you are a representative of your people, then your people are ones we would work to make peace with. Please - take this offering to the orcish warchief that resides in the lands of Durotar; I believe you call this city Orgrimmar. In times past, he had tried to make contact with us on behalf of his Horde. It is now only fitting to acknowledge you as the key in your Horde's efforts in brokering peace.Arcane Instability^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ley-Keeper Velania^Ley-Keeper Velania^Major Malfunction^^^Ley-Keeper Velania wants you to kill 5 Manawraiths and 5 Mana Stalkers.^It's about time that dimwit, Caidanis, sent someone this way. I warned of the dangers of increasing the load on the West Sanctum! Now one of our energy converters is destroyed and arcane wraiths are pouring out of the sanctum! I'm going to need you to take care of these creatures before we send anyone in for repairs. Make haste!Corrupted Soil^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Mirveda^Apprentice Mirveda^The Wayward Apprentice^^Unexpected Results^Apprentice Mirveda at the East Sanctum in Eversong Woods wants you to collect 8 Tainted Soil Samples.^This was a fully functional arcane sanctum before Arthas and his army of Scourge decided to plow through it on their way to Silvermoon. Now it's as useful to us as any part of the Dead Scar. The soil is tainted, undead are drawn to it and the energy in the ley lines is completely disrupted. What I want to know, <name>, is whether this taint is reversible or not. I want you to collect soil samples from this area so I can study them. Perhaps with time we can set things back to normal.Unexpected Results^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Mirveda^Apprentice Mirveda^Unexpected Results^Corrupted Soil^^Protect Apprentice Mirveda from the Scourge ambush.^Something's wrong, <name>. I sense the presence of Scourge. Be ready to fight them!Powering our Defenses^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Runewarden Deryan^Runewarden Deryan^Runewarden Deryan^^^Place the Infused Crystal at the Eastern Runestone and protect it from the Scourge for 1 minute. Return the Infused Crystal to Runewarden Deryan in Eversong Woods for a reward.^Ancient runestones once powered a protective barrier across the Eversong border. Many were destroyed during Arthas' attack; others were stolen. Of the three that remain, only this one has retained its powers. The runestone to the east might be salvageable, though. Take this crystal and instill its energy on the Eastern Runestone. The process should take but a minute. Beware though, nearby Scourge will be drawn to it and will seek to destroy it. Do not let them!Pelt Collection^7^Horde^Eversong Woods^Velan Brightoak^Velan Brightoak^^^^Velan Brightoak at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods wants you to bring him 6 Springpaw Pelts.^The springpaw that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts. We've even seen night elf scum travel to these lands just to poach them. Our skirmishes with the Amani have put a bit of a strain on our supply of gear and our rangers don't have much time to hunt for pelts anymore. If you'd be willing to lend a hand by collecting springpaw pelts, I'd be happy to reward you with a hand-crafted piece of armor. You'll find springpaw stalkers all around the woods north of here.The Alliance Needs Copper Bars!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Sergeant Stonebrow^Sergeant Stonebrow^^^The Alliance Needs More Copper Bars!^Bring 20 Copper Bars to Sergeant Stonebrow at the Military Ward in Ironforge.^Hey there, <class>, you look fit enough to contribute to the war effort! We need all of the help that we can get here to put together the materiel needed for the Ahn'Qiraj War and it's your lucky day. I'm collecting copper bars in stacks of twenty. It's for a worthy cause, what do you say? Do you think you could help out the Alliance?The Alliance Needs More Copper Bars!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Sergeant Stonebrow^Sergeant Stonebrow^^The Alliance Needs Copper Bars!^^Bring 20 copper bars to Sergeant Stonebrow at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Back again <class>?

In case you hadn't heard while you were out there "adventuring", the Alliance has been gearing up for a war in Ahn'Qiraj and is in need of iron bars... a whole mess of 'em. Bring them to me in stacks of twenty. We can count on you, right, <class>?The Alliance Needs More Iron Bars!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Corporal Carnes^Corporal Carnes^^The Alliance Needs Iron Bars!^^Bring 20 iron bars to Corporal Carnes at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Back so soon? Stop making me re-evaluate my low opinion of you <class>, you're making me feel all gooey inside. So, as you can tell we still don't have enough iron bars for all of the weapons, armor, steam tanks and whatnot that need building for the bug hunt. Think you have it in you to bring back another stack of twenty iron bars in between all of those trips to Zul'Gurub, or wherever it is that you kids hang out these days?Bandages for the Field^60^All^Silithus^Logistics Task Briefing X^Windcaller Proudhorn^^^^Bring 30 Heavy Runecloth Bandages, 30 Heavy Silk Bandages and 30 Heavy Mageweave Bandages to Windcaller Proudhorn at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.

You must also bring Logistics Task Briefing I in order to complete this quest.^With the arrival of fresh recruits to Cenarion Hold comes the problem of keeping them alive in the desert.

In addition to all of the other collection efforts underway, we are in need of a great quantity of thorium bars, which is the task that I am in charge of. The thorium will be used in the creation of many different things for the war, foremost of which is the construction of a battalion of steam tanks to be airlifted into Silithus as soon as they are completed. Can you aid us in this endeavor, <class>?The Alliance Needs More Thorium Bars!^60^Alliance^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Dame Twinbraid^Dame Twinbraid^^The Alliance Needs Thorium Bars!^^Bring 20 thorium bars to Dame Twinbraid at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^It is so good to see you again <name>. I hope that you've been doing well. It's true that we are still in need of thorium bars. If you have them to spare I am collecting them for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort.Target: Hive'Ashi Stingers^60^All^Silithus^Combat Task Briefing XII^Commander Mar'alith^^^^Kill 30 Hive'Ashi Stingers and report back to Commander Mar'alith at Cenarion Hold in Silithus. You must also bring Combat Task Briefing XII in order to complete this quest.^As the war effort mounts, the silithid presence in the area presents an ever increasing threat to our operations.

Report back to Commander Mar'alith after your task is completed.Target: Hive'Ashi Workers^60^All^Silithus^Combat Task Briefing III^Commander Mar'alith^^^^Slay 30 Hive'Ashi Workers and report back to Commander Mar'alith at Cenarion Hold in Silithus.

I did? Oh well... in any case we need a lot of it, and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT! Do you think that you could help us out? I know that it means going without all of those wonderful things that you can make with it, but it's for a good cause!The Alliance Needs More Stranglekelp!^60^Alliance^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Private Draxlegauge^Private Draxlegauge^^The Alliance Needs Stranglekelp!^^Bring 20 stranglekelp to Private Draxlegauge at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Well hello again there... what was it?

Think you could gather up twenty more?The Alliance Needs Purple Lotus!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Master Nightsong^Master Nightsong^^^The Alliance Needs More Purple Lotus!^Bring 20 Purple Lotus to Master Nightsong at the Military Ward in Ironforge.^<class>, the purple lotus is a flower with a plentitude of uses. I am here at the request of the Alliance as an authority on those applications, to preserve the herbs collected and to ensure that their war effort acquires enough purple lotus to sustain whatever function they plan for it. I would like for you to travel out into the world and return to me with some of these flowers. Is that something that you can do?The Alliance Needs More Purple Lotus!^60^Alliance^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Master Nightsong^Master Nightsong^^The Alliance Needs Purple Lotus!^^Bring 20 purple lotus to Master Nightsong at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Welcome back <class>.

The Alliance needs to collect a large quantity of Arthas' Tears for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort. Don't ask me what for; I'm just following orders. But I'd like you to gather up as many of the herbs as you can and bring them back to me here. Are you willing to do that?The Alliance Needs More Arthas' Tears!^60^Alliance^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Sergeant Major Germaine^Sergeant Major Germaine^^The Alliance Needs Arthas' Tears!^^Bring 20 arthas' tears to Sergeant Major Germaine at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Ok, so it looks like I still need more Arthas' Tears. I would imagine that you will be able to find them in the general location that you gathered them up for me last time. The quicker we get these, the faster we can start up the offensive against the forces at Ahn'Qiraj. You gonna help us out again <class>?The Alliance Needs Light Leather!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Bonnie Stoneflayer^Bonnie Stoneflayer^^^The Alliance Needs More Light Leather!^Bring 10 Light Leather to Bonnie Stoneflayer at the Military Ward in Ironforge.^We Stoneflayers have a long history of being skinners, <class>. That's why the Alliance has asked my family to help out with the collection of light leather for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort. I'm here to see to it that the leather is tanned correctly for whatever they want to put it to use for. But we need your help. Since I have to be here doing that, I need you to go out and collect the skins, returning them to me here. What do you say, <lad /lass>, will you give it a go?The Alliance Needs More Light Leather!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Bonnie Stoneflayer^Bonnie Stoneflayer^^The Alliance Needs Light Leather!^^Bring 10 light leather to Bonnie Stoneflayer at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Good to see you again <name>.

We'll make tons of things with it, but first we need to get a ton of it. And I mean that literally! That's where you come in. So, do you think you can go out there and bring me back a nice, fat stack of thick leather? Do yah, do yah?!The Alliance Needs More Thick Leather!^60^All^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Marta Finespindle^Marta Finespindle^^The Alliance Needs Thick Leather!^^Bring 10 thick leather to Marta Finespindle at the airfield in Dun Morogh.^Yep, the stack's still not high enough. <name>, we still haven't reached our goal of WorldState #2071 thick leather. Just think of all the things that we can make with all of that leather! All kinds of armor and weapons. Stuff for inside the steam tanks and rifle scopes!

The venom samples you collected are for an acquaintance of mine, Mux Manascrambler, an engineer with an interest in the supernatural. His latest project consists of a device that allows you to communicate with the dead!

Bring them along with the Ectoplasmic Distiller back to Mux Manascrambler in Gadgetzan.^A fine piece of engineering, if I do say so myself! You will need to travel a bit, I'm afraid, in order to find the incorporeal undead we require. You see, different climates lend different consistencies to the spectral fabric of the dead. The tortured night elves of Silithus, the spirits of the highborne from Winterspring and the ghosts and banshees of the Eastern Plaguelands should give us the different types of ectoplasm we need.

To do that we need to get a brazier and some special coals to burn in it. There are three nobles of fire, Lord Incedius in Blackrock Depths, Pyroguard Emberseer in Blackrock Spire and The Duke of Cynders in Silithus, with what we need.

His yes-man, Kel'Thuzad, amassing for another attack upon our lands. We will not allow it! Prove your dedication. Prove that you are willing to risk life and limb to stop this madness and the combined might of the Dawn and the Crusade will be at your beck and call. Enter Naxxramas and destroy the Scourge within...Roadside Ambush^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Ralen^Apprentice Meledor^Roadside Ambush^^^Speak to Apprentice Meledor in Eversong Woods along the road heading south from Silvermoon City.^You, there! You must help me, please! A fellow apprentice and I were attacked by the Wretched! In their mad hunger for magic, they took everything they could get their hands on: mana crystals, wands, spellbooks... everything! Meledor gave chase after them; I had to stay behind and look after what they didn't take. Continue down the road and see if you can lend him a hand.Redemption Headpiece^60^All^Paladin^Commander Eligor Dawnbringer^Commander Eligor Dawnbringer^^Echoes of War^^Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make a Redemption Headpiece if you bring him the following: 1 Desecrated Headpiece, 15 Wartorn Plate Scraps, 5 Arcanite Bars and 2 Cured Rugged Hides.^You will find the remnants of our fallen heroes on the corpses of the Lords of Naxxramas. Bring those desecrated keepsakes to me along with wartorn plate scraps and crafting materials capable of revitalizing the cursed armor and I shall craft a fine piece of armor for you.Toxic Test^52^All^Druid^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^^^Stab a Devilsaur with the Devilsaur Barb. Return to Torwa Pathfinder in Un'Goro Crater when you have completed this task.^The toxin you helped me create is for a special purpose. The great devilsaurs of the crater make it dangerous to hunt and difficult for me to survive. Even if I possessed the necessary strength, killing a devilsaur simply allows another to move into its territory. Take this poisoned barb and stab it deep into a living devilsaur. The toxin should pacify the creature, though I do not know how quickly...Bloodpetal Poison^52^All^Druid^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^^^Collect 8 Bloodcap and 8 Gorishi Stings, and return to Torwa Pathfinder in Un'Goro Crater.^I would ask you to help me create a toxin of sorts, to pacify a great creature living here in the crater. It is not deadly, and only the keen eyes of a <class> can hope to collect the ingredients. You can find the bloodcap mushrooms growing within the bloodpetal sprouts all across the crater. Gorishi stings are from the insects inside and around the Slithering Scar, located in the southern part of the crater.A Better Ingredient^52^All^Druid^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^^^Retrieve a Putrid Vine from the guardian at the bottom of the Sunken Temple and return to Torwa Pathfinder.^It is as I feared -- the toxin is simply too weak for such a powerful creature. If we are to create a toxin of high enough potency, you must venture to the bottom of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, unlock the secrets of the altar and recover a putrid vine from the guardian there. The temple is dangerous, and it would behoove you to bring friends. Return to me when this is done.Soaked Pages^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Meledor^Apprentice Meledor^Roadside Ambush^^^Apprentice Meledor in Eversong Woods wants you to search the water beneath the bridge nearby and bring him Antheol's Elemental Grimoire.^Those blasted Wretched sure can run fast at the sight of someone who'll stand up to them. But let's not worry about that now. I need to find my instructor's elemental grimoire. I'm certain I saw one of those cowards throw it into the river but I cannot seem to be able to locate it. I could use another set of eyes. I'll throw in a bit of coin if you spot it.Torwa Pathfinder^52^All^Druid^Turak Runetotem^Torwa Pathfinder^Torwa Pathfinder^^^Speak with Torwa Pathfinder in Un'Goro Crater.^A hunter by the name of Torwa Pathfinder has requested the help of a druid. He said only we would possess the necessary skills and respect for nature to help him. There is a road that connects the Un'Goro Crater and the desert of Tanaris. As that road enters the crater, you will find Torwa close by.Taking the Fall^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Meledor^Instructor Antheol^Roadside Ambush^^^Bring Antheol's Elemental Grimoire to Instructor Antheol at Stillwhisper Pond in Eversong Woods.^Antheol is going to fly off his rocker when he finds out his book is ruined. I've got a little proposal for you; don't worry, I'll make it worth your while. Take this book to him and tell him nothing of this incident. If he asks, just tell him you dropped the book into a puddle. He has no direct authority over you, so there's not much he can do. Antheol delivers his lectures at Stillwhisper Pond, southeast of Silvermoon. You'll do this for us, right? I'll reward you handsomely for this favor!Swift Discipline^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Instructor Antheol^Instructor Antheol^Roadside Ambush^^^Use Antheol's Disciplinary Rod on his two students: Apprentice Ralen and Apprentice Meledor. Return to Antheol at Stillwhisper Pond in Eversong Woods with the rod after this.^I hope you learn a valuable lesson today, <name>. Never trust someone else to lie for you. Now I want you to go back to my two dimwitted students and discipline them using this wand. My magic tells me that you'll find them along the road to the west on the other side of the Dead Scar. Come back to me after you've done this. I'll give you a small reward for your troubles.The Party Never Ends^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Lord Saltheril^Lord Saltheril^Saltheril's Haven^^^Acquire a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve, Springpaw Appetizers and a Bundle of Fireworks, and return them to Lord Saltheril at Saltheril's Haven in Eversong Woods.^I like to throw parties... just a little something to celebrate the magnificence that is Quel'Thalas! But, I'm in a bit of a bind. I need you to gather up more party supplies. From Vinemaster Suntouched at the Silvermoon City inn, bring me a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve. From Zalene Firstlight at Farstrider Retreat acquire more of those delicious Springpaw Appetizers. And you can pick up my delivery of fireworks from Halis Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village. Be quick about it!Wretched Ringleader^8^Horde^Eversong Woods^Velendris Whitemorn^Velendris Whitemorn^Lost Armaments^^^Bring Aldaron's Head to Velendris Whitemorn near Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods.^The Wretched are so oblivious, gorging on foul magic, that they haven't realized we've recovered most of our weapons. We can't expect them to remain in their stupor, though. Now is the time for a decisive attack. Let us make an example of their leader, Aldaron. He was spotted on the top floor of the building by the anchorage. Bring me his head; I'll reward you suitably.Shadows of Doom^50^All^Scourge Invasion^Commander Thomas Helleran^Commander Thomas Helleran^^^^Go to a summoning circle and kill a Shadow of Doom, then return to Commander Thomas Helleran at Light's Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands.^After you bring down the defenses of the Scourge summoning circles, you must confront the acolytes who protect them. In truth, these are not men. They are shadows, some of the Lich King's most frightening creatures. They can be revealed using the necrotic runes they carry, and then destroyed with magic or strength of arms.Malfunction at the West Sanctum^5^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ley-Keeper Caidanis^Ley-Keeper Velania^Major Malfunction^^^Speak to Ley-Keeper Velania at the West Sanctum in Eversong Woods.^Since you're here, <name>, I've a favor to ask you. Ley-Keeper Velania's apprentice dropped by earlier to ask for assistance. Apparently there's some malfunction happening at the West Sanctum. I've been a bit busy entertaining our... most pleasant... dwarven guest. See if you can give her a hand. You'll find the West Sanctum southwest of here.The Fall of Kel'Thuzad^60^All^Naxxramas^The Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad^ ^^^^Take the Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad to Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^The phylactery is all that remains of the master of Naxxramas. Your better judgment dictates that you destroy the phylactery, preventing the lich from ever reforming. Thankfully, you seldom listen to that internal voice of reason. Someone at Light's Hope will pay you hugely for this artifact. Who cares if Kel'Thuzad regenerates to full power?The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Archmage Angela Dosantos^Archmage Angela Dosantos^^^Echoes of War^Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 5 Arcane Crystals, 2 Nexus Crystals, 1 Righteous Orb and 60 gold pieces. You must also be Honored with the Argent Dawn.^In the thick of Plaguewood lies the entrance to the dread citadel of Naxxramas. Previously, all attempts to enter had been stymied by the magical wards placed upon the rune portal. That is, until now. We have devised a way to gain entry via arcane cloaking - an old cantrip of the Kirin Tor with a few modifications of my own. Since your dedication to the cause of the Dawn is somewhat lacking, <name>, the price will be high. You may decline and choose to return when you are revered or exalted for a discount.The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Archmage Angela Dosantos^Archmage Angela Dosantos^^^Echoes of War^Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 2 Arcane Crystals, 1 Nexus Crystal and 30 gold pieces. You must also be Revered with the Argent Dawn.^In the thick of Plaguewood lies the entrance to the dread citadel of Naxxramas. Previously, all attempts to enter had been stymied by the magical wards placed upon the rune portal. That is, until now. We have devised a way to gain entry via a permanent arcane cloaking of sorts - an old cantrip of the Kirin Tor with a few modifications of my own. With that said, the cloaking is costly. Since your dedication to the cause of the Dawn is admirable, we are willing to incur some of those costs.The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Archmage Angela Dosantos^Archmage Angela Dosantos^^^Echoes of War^Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will grant you Arcane Cloaking at no cost. You must be Exalted with the Argent Dawn.^In the thick of Plaguewood lies the entrance to the dread citadel of Naxxramas. Previously, all attempts to enter had been stymied by the magical wards placed upon the rune portal. That is, until now. We have devised a way to gain entry via a permanent arcane cloaking of sorts - an old cantrip of the Kirin Tor with a few modifications of my own. With that said, the cloaking is costly; however, your dedication to the cause of the Dawn is unwavering! We will waive all cost associations.Cryptstalker Armor Doesn't Make Itself...^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Huntsman Leopold^Huntsman Leopold^^^Crypt Fiend Parts^Huntsman Leopold at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Crypt Fiend Parts.^How would you like to earn yourself one of these shiny coins? <Leopold holds up an insignia of the Crusade.> I've got a little problem that you might be able to help me with, <name>. You see, I make Cryptstalker armor for those daft enough to venture into Naxxramas. While they supply me with the core material requirements for the armor, I always run out of the crypt fiend parts. Bring me back a bundle of parts and I'll pay you with an insignia - usable at the quartermaster.Bonescythe Digs^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Rohan the Assassin^Rohan the Assassin^^^Bone Fragments^Rohan the Assassin at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Bone Fragments.^Don Julio's Bonescythe armor pattern requires bone fragments - a lot of bone fragments. While those crazy enough to venture into Naxxramas provide me with enough of the core materials to make the armor, I'm always looking for more Scourge bone fragments. So what do you think? Interested in getting your hands dirty and destroying some Scourge at the same time? It's a win-win situation.The Elemental Equation^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Archmage Angela Dosantos^Archmage Angela Dosantos^^^Core of Elements^Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Core of Elements.^Greetings, adventurer! Are you interested in some work? I pay those under my employ with insignias. These insignias can be used at the Quartermaster to purchase items of power. All I need you to do is bring me as many core of elements as you can carry. The more the better! You'll find them on elementals of varying shapes and sizes that exist across our world.Goods from Silvermoon City^10^Blood Elf^Ghostlands^Quartermaster Lymel^Skymaster Sunwing^Goods from Silvermoon City^The Forsaken^^Deliver Quartermaster Lymel's Bill of Lading to Skymaster Sunwing in Tranquillien.^Welcome volunteer! We're running low on supplies here, but the blood elves have promised us materiel assistance. That's where you come in. Take this bill of lading over to Skymaster Sunwing. He'll have further instructions for you on how best to get up to Silvermoon City.Binding the Dreadnaught^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Korfax, Champion of the Light^Korfax, Champion of the Light^^^Dark Iron Scraps^Korfax at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Dark Iron Scraps.^Have you ever seen Dreadnaught armor, <class>? No, of course you haven't. You're still a <boy/girl> - a tyke. Let me tell you, it is glorious. You're probably asking yourself what any of this has to do with you, right? I'll tell you what, scrub; I need Dark Iron scraps and I'm willing to pay to get my hands on as many as possible. I need the scraps to put together sets of Dreadnaught for our champions. Bring me scraps and get paid.Fly to Silvermoon City^10^Blood Elf^Ghostlands^Skymaster Sunwing^Sathren Azuredawn^Goods from Silvermoon City^^^Purchase a flight to Silvermoon City and deliver Quartermaster Lymel's Bill of Lading to Sathren Azuredawn in Silvermoon City.^<class>, for a very modest amount of coin, I can send you swiftly flying through the air on one of these magnificent beasts. And, it's safer than walking there, I can assure you! When you arrive in Silvermoon City, seek out Sathren Azuredawn in the Bazaar. Speak with me once more when you've decided you're ready to brave the skies.Skymistress Gloaming^10^Blood Elf^Ghostlands^Sathren Azuredawn^Skymistress Gloaming^Goods from Silvermoon City^^^Bring Quartermaster Lymel's Goods to Skymistress Gloaming just outside Silvermoon City's Shepherd's Gate.^It doesn't look as if you have a cart or a beast of burden with you, so I'd better send you back only with what you can carry. If you've spoken with Skymaster Sunwing at Tranquillien, then you should get this to Quartermaster Lymel as soon as possible by flying back. Take these goods for final inspection to Skymistress Gloaming just outside Silvermoon City's Shepherd's Gate.Return to Quartermaster Lymel^10^Blood Elf^Ghostlands^Skymistress Gloaming^Quartermaster Lymel^Goods from Silvermoon City^^^Purchase a flight back to Tranquillien in the Ghostlands and deliver Quartermaster Lymel's Goods to Quartermaster Lymel at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^It all checks out as far as I can tell. Seems to me that the Forsaken have put their backs to the wall for us and we owe them, even if they are all ugly and rotting. So, the question is, have you already spoken to Skymaster Sunwing in Tranquillien? If so, then this can be as simple as you paying the small fare and quickly flying back. Let me know when you're ready.Savage Flora^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Rayne^Rayne^^^Savage Fronds^Rayne at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Savage Fronds.^I make a special type of armor for the brave heroes that enter Naxxramas known as Dreamwalker. They are able to provide me with most of the materials I require but I am always looking for those able to retrieve savage fronds from the flora of our world. You may think of this job as beneath you, but without the fronds, the armor could not be made. I am also in a unique position to pay you with an insignia of your choice as both the Dawn and the Crusade supply me with funds.Suncrown Village^10^Horde^Ghostlands^Arcanist Vandril^Arcanist Vandril^The Forsaken^^^Slay 10 Nerubis Guards and then return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^We're surrounded here, <class>. The outlying villages have all been overrun by the Scourge! You must head northeast to Suncrown Village immediately and deal with the Nerubian Scourge menace. You can't miss them - they're spider-like creatures. There's no time to waste.... Quel'Thalas must be reclaimed!Goldenmist Village^11^Horde^Ghostlands^Arcanist Vandril^Arcanist Vandril^The Forsaken^^^Defeat 6 Quel'dorei Ghosts and 4 Quel'dorei Wraiths at Goldenmist Village, and then return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^We've had one success, but there are two more villages that must be reclaimed! Goldenmist Village is our next target. It lies to the northwest, and has been taken by the ghosts of the high elves that used to live there. Gruesome, I know, but these are apparently the sorts of tactics that the Scourge like to employ. Go and defeat these ghosts and wraiths, <class>. Take the west road out of Tranquillien to get there.Windrunner Village^14^Horde^Ghostlands^Arcanist Vandril^Arcanist Vandril^The Forsaken^^^Gather 6 Phantasmal Substance and 4 Gargoyle Fragments. Return them to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^<name>, the final battle against the Ghostlands villages is upon you. Windrunner Village to the southwest has been overrun by a large force of the more powerful Scourge shocktroopers; shades and gargoyles. You will be the spearpoint of our offensive by thinning out their numbers. The magisters at the nearby Sanctum of the Sun have made a special request this time; they want the remains from these Scourge to study in hopes of finding creative ways of fighting them. Good hunting!They Call Me "The Rooster"^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Dispatch Commander Metz^Dispatch Commander Metz^^^Craftsman's Writ^Dispatch Commander Metz at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants an Argent Dawn Valor Token.^You want a writ? What? Do you expect me to hand you a highly sought after work order just for showing up? I think not, scrub. Crafters from around the world bid for jobs here at the front lines. If you want a work order, you'll have to show me that you're willing to bleed for the cause. Bring me a valor token and we'll talk. And there's only one way to get your grubby little scrub mitts on those - get to killin'.Dealing with Zeb'Sora^12^Horde^Ghostlands^Ranger Valanna^Ranger Valanna^Help Ranger Valanna!^^^Collect 6 Zeb'Sora Troll Ears and return them to Ranger Valanna in the Ghostlands.^The lieutenant here rushed us into battle with the trolls across the lake instead of scouting the situation first. We were decimated by his stupidity! You hear me Tomathren? You're an idiot! Will you help us, <class>? Those trolls still need to be dealt with. I need to stay here and nursemaid him -- I think he's lost his mind. Just head east to the other side of the lake into Zeb'Sora. I want revenge... bring me their ears so that I can fashion a nice necklace!Missing in the Ghostlands^10^Horde^Ghostlands^Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider^Courier Dawnstrider^^^The Fallen Courier^Follow the road out of Fairbreeze Village towards the south and look for Courier Dawnstrider as you approach the Ghostlands.^My nephew was sent into the Ghostlands a few days ago. He never mentioned anything about his task, except that it was of an extremely secret nature. He never returned and I fear for the worst, <class>. A missing messenger might not mean much to the callous magisters of Silvermoon, but he's like a son to me. Please, <name>, will you look for him?Help Ranger Valanna!^12^Horde^Ghostlands^Ranger Lethvalin^Ranger Valanna^Help Ranger Valanna!^^^Find Ranger Valanna and Lieutenant Tomathren on the shore of Lake Elrendar in the Ghostlands near Suncrown Village.^<class>, I can't just sit here waiting for an audience with the high executor or Dame Auriferous! This cannot wait! We were dealing with the Shadowpine trolls of Zeb'Sora to the northeast across Lake Elrendar. But the lieutenant mishandled the attack and we lost a lot of Farstriders. Then he just fell to pieces afterward. Ranger Valanna sent me here, and Ranger Salissa to the Farstrider Enclave for help. Please find them, <class>. Valanna was badly injured and the lieutenant's useless.Report to Captain Helios^12^Horde^Ghostlands^Ranger Valanna^Captain Helios^Help Ranger Valanna!^^^Speak with Captain Helios at the Farstrider Enclave on the southern shore of Lake Elrendar in the Ghostlands.^I need one last favor of you, <class>. Just in case Ranger Salissa didn't make it back to Farstrider Enclave on the south edge of the lake, I need you to go there and get help. Just check in with Captain Helios and let him know what's happened here. I'm sure he'll send help back as soon as he can.The Fallen Courier^10^Horde^Ghostlands^Apothecary Thedra^Apothecary Thedra^^Missing in the Ghostlands^Delivery to Tranquillien^Apothecary Thedra in Eversong Woods wants you to bring her 4 Plagued Blood Samples from beasts in the Ghostlands.^What are you standing around for? Can't you see this boy needs immediate attention? By the looks of it, the plague is beginning to take over his body. Within minutes not even a master apothecary like me will be able to save him. The animals south of the river all carry the plague in their blood. Go across the bridge and hunt the plagued beasts there. Bring me enough plagued blood samples and I'll distill a serum capable of saving this blood elf. Hurry!Delivery to Tranquillien^10^Horde^Ghostlands^Courier Dawnstrider^Arcanist Vandril^^The Fallen Courier^^Bring the Letter from Silvermoon to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^I... I'm too weak to continue. I carry a dire warning from Regent Lord Theron, in the form of a letter. You'll have to deliver it for me. Take it to Arcanist Vandril in Tranquillien. You'll find the town further to the south along this road. Go there and... find Vandril...The Plagued Coast^13^Horde^Ghostlands^Apothecary Renzithen^Apothecary Renzithen^^^^Bring 6 Plagued Murloc Spines to Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^To find a cure for the plague we need to understand how it affects different creatures, from the most complex life forms to the lowliest subspecies. I've come here to study the murlocs since, like us, they've retained free will in undeath. What makes these lowly mongrels so special? I need to find out, <name>! Travel northwest and bring me their spines so that I may study the accumulation of plague in their marrow. Who knows what secrets their little bones hold?Salvaging the Past^12^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Darenis^Magister Darenis^^^^Magister Darenis wants you to travel to the Sanctum of the Moon to the west of Tranquillien and recover 8 Crystallized Mana Essences from the Arcane Devourers and Mana Shifters that inhabit the structure.^Can you believe it? We have an actual functioning arcane sanctum up and running southeast of here: the Sanctum of the Sun. All manner of important magisters have come to take part in running it. Of course they've all forgotten about the Sanctum of the Moon. Not much remains of it and its energies have given rise to bizarre creatures. I'm not one to let good resources go to waste, however. Go to the Sanctum of the Moon and see if you can recover the crystallized essences from the creatures there.The Sanctum of the Sun^20^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Darenis^Magister Idonis^The Sanctum of the Sun^^^Speak to Magister Idonis in the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands.^You've proven your loyalty to Tranquillien and have helped us defend it against the threat of the Scourge. Some of our most powerful magisters have come from Silvermoon to help us take the fight to the enemy's doorstep. They've rebuilt the arcane sanctum to the south and have driven the Scourge away from the surrounding area. They plan to launch an offensive into Deatholme, Dar'Khan's stronghold. You would do well to join them, <name>. I'm sure they can make use of a seasoned <class> like yourself.Tomber's Supplies^11^Horde^Ghostlands^Rathis Tomber^Rathis Tomber^^^^Retrieve Rathis Tomber's Supplies and return it to him at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^How am I supposed to supply the war effort when I cannot even safely get my supplies here? I was promised an escort that never came. And then, I had to leave one of my carts behind to the west when I was attacked by a band of ghouls! Want to help out, and get me open for business in the process? Go down the western road out of town and past the graveyard. On the other side of the Dead Scar is a fork in the road. The hill that my cart had to be left on lies just beyond.Under the Shadow^50^All^Scourge Invasion^Commander Thomas Helleran^Commander Thomas Helleran^^^^Check your map to find an area under Scourge attack. Go there and damage a necropolis by defeating the Scourge around them. Return 10 of their Necrotic Runes to Commander Thomas Helleran at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^The floating necropolises of the Scourge plague the lands of Horde and Alliance alike. Tanaris, the Blasted Lands, Winterspring and the Burning Steppes are blanketed in the shadows of the flying fortresses. Only through our combined efforts will they be repelled. Each necropolis is supported by nearby magical circles, and among each circle swarms a host of undead creartures. We have determined that destroying these mindless hordes will destroy the circle's defenses.Down the Dead Scar^14^Horde^Ghostlands^Deathstalker Rathiel^Deathstalker Rathiel^^^^Slay 10 Risen Hungerers and 10 Gangled Cannibals on the Dead Scar. Return to Deathstalker Rathiel in Tranquillien for a reward.^If you've made it this far then you probably know about the Dead Scar and how to this day mindless Scourge follow the path of destruction that Arthas created on his way to Silvermoon City. Make yourself useful and thin down the Scourge's numbers in the Scar. If you prove to be worth your salt I'll put in a good word for you.Wanted: Knucklerot and Luzran^21^Horde^Ghostlands^Wanted Poster^Deathstalker Rathiel^^^^Search the Ghostlands for Knucklerot and Luzran. Bring their heads to Deathstalker Rathiel in Tranquillien for a reward.^A bounty is hereby declared for the abominations known as Knucklerot and Luzran. These dreadful creations of Dar'Khan are extremely dangerous and have been sighted patrolling near the Howling and Bleeding Ziggurats. Individuals seeking to claim the reward must present the abominations' heads to Deathstalker Rathiel as proof of the deed.Forgotten Rituals^12^Horde^Ghostlands^Geranis Whitemorn^Geranis Whitemorn^Forgotten Rituals^^^Bring 8 Wavefront Medallions to Geranis Whitemorn in the Ghostlands.^Every year we, the denizens of Suncrown Village, would take part in a ritual to keep the different aspects of nature under our control. Dominion over the element of water was symbolized by the summoning and enslavement of an elemental named Aquantion. Through a wicked perversion of our magic, the scoundrel broke his bonds and enslaved us instead! We wore medallions shaped like waves during the ritual. Seek them at the bottom of the lake; we'll need them to free my compatriots' spirits!Bearers of the Plague^14^Horde^Ghostlands^Farstrider Sedina^Farstrider Sedina^^^Curbing the Plague^Farstrider Sedina at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands wants you to slay 10 Ghostclaw Lynxes.^You show courage coming to the Ghostlands, <name>. There is much work to be done here and not enough brave souls to do it. I've a thankless task to offer you, should you have the inclination to aid our cause. The very wildlife in this land has been tainted by the plague and we must stop it from spreading. Hunt the ghostclaw lynxes to the east and south of here and return when you've slain enough of them.Curbing the Plague^15^Horde^Ghostlands^Farstrider Sedina^Farstrider Sedina^^Bearers of the Plague^^Farstrider Sedina at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands wants you to slay 8 Spindleweb Lurkers and 10 Vampiric Mistbats.^You've proven your worth as an ally, <name>. I need you to continue your task and track down more plagued wildlife. This time seek out some of the more dangerous beasts. Hunt the spindleweb lurkers west of the Dead Scar and the vampiric mistbats just south of here. Return to me when you're done.Investigate An'daroth^11^Horde^Ghostlands^Dame Auriferous^Dame Auriferous^Investigate An'daroth^^^Investigate the area at An'daroth, kill 12 Sentinel Spies and then return to Dame Auriferous at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^<class>, we are having difficulty with a group of night elves that have recently taken over a nearby island. They've set up a small camp at the old high elf ley-line nexus, An'daroth, to the northwest. There is a dirt path that leads up to it just past the Dead Scar. I suggest that you lend us your aid by going there, investigating what they are up to, and slaying as many of the conceited night elves as you can.The Traitor's Shadow^16^Horde^Ghostlands^Ranger Vynna^Dusty Journal^The Farstrider Enclave^^^Travel to Dawnstar Spire in the Ghostlands and search for any clues involving Dar'Khan's past.^Dar'Khan Drathir is believed to have returned from the dead to rule over the armies of the Scourge in the Ghostlands. Dar'Khan aligned himself with the Scourge long ago... yet he was once a living, breathing elf. Much of his time was spent inside Dawnstar Spire, northeast of here. He hid there for many nights, scheming against his own. Search the tower for more information, <name>. Perhaps he had a journal or kept notes. One never knows where useful information might present itself.Hints of the Past^16^Horde^Ghostlands^Dusty Journal^Ranger Vynna^The Farstrider Enclave^^^Return to Ranger Vynna at the Farstrider Enclave with Dar'Khan's Journal.^As you skim through the pages in the journal you're overcome by an unnerving sense of being watched. The contents are unsettling. Dar'Khan's soul was one filled with hatred and contempt for his own people. The extent of his machinations and plots are all documented in great detail. Perhaps there is something here that Vynna will find useful.Into Occupied Territory^14^Horde^Ghostlands^Dame Auriferous^Dame Auriferous^Investigate An'daroth^^^Steal the Night Elf Plans: An'daroth, Night Elf Plans: An'owyn and Night Elf Plans: Scrying on the Sin'dorei, and return them to Dame Auriferous at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by. I want you to head west down the road out of town to Shalandis Isle, just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship.Captives at Deatholme^20^Horde^Ghostlands^Apothecary Renzithen^Arcanist Janeda^A Restorative Draught^^^Take Renzithen's Restorative Draught to Deatholme and rescue Apprentice Varnis, Apothecary Enith and Ranger Vedoran. Return to Arcanist Janeda at the Sanctum of the Sun for a reward.^Ah, yes. One of my finest creations. This draught will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor. Side effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness. All much preferable to whatever the Scourge plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me. Best of luck, brave <class>. You are going to need it.Writ of Safe Passage^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Guard Didier^Dispatch Commander Metz^^^^Deliver the signed Writ of Safe Passage to Dispatch Commander Metz at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^Without the help of adventurers, my caravan would have never made it! Scourge were coming out of the woodwork to try and stop us from getting here. <Guard Didier wipes his brow.> Now we need to wait here for Field Marshal Chambers to arrive. He'll sign your writ of safe passage to take back to Dispatch Commander Metz at Light's Hope Chapel. And <name>, watch what you say around Chambers. He's the 'bite off your head and spit down your wind pipe' type of guy - except that he'll actually do it...Deliver the Plans to An'telas^16^Horde^Ghostlands^Dame Auriferous^Magister Sylastor^Investigate An'daroth^^Deactivate An'owyn^Deliver the Night Elf Plans to Magister Sylastor at An'telas in the Ghostlands.^You must deliver the recovered night elf plans to An'telas for me. It is to the east, on the southern slopes of Sungraze Peak, just to the northeast of the Sanctum of the Sun. Magister Sylastor is there conducting ongoing studies into the ley-line nexus energy for potential use in our fight against the Scourge. Have him look at these plans to shed some light on what it is that these night elves are up to.The Traitor's Destruction^21^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Kaendris^Magister Kaendris^The Farstrider Enclave^^Hero of the Sin'dorei, Friend of the Sin'dorei^Slay Dar'Khan Drathir inside Deatholme and bring his head to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands.^Everything we've done in the Ghostlands has been done with the goal of taking back what is rightfully ours. The Scourge have maintained their chokehold on the region for far too long. The time has come for payback, <name>. Thanks to your help and the help of our new allies, the Forsaken, vengeance will soon be ours. He who sought to steal the power of the Sunwell must die. Go to Deatholme, the Scourge stronghold south of the Dead Scar. Bring me Dar'Khan's head and your deeds will go down in history!Deactivate An'owyn^16^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Sylastor^Magister Sylastor^^Deliver the Plans to An'telas^^Retrieve the Crystal Controlling Orb and then use it to deactivate the Night Elf Moon Crystal at An'owyn. Then return to Magister Sylastor at An'telas in the Ghostlands.^Their moon crystals are scrying devices -- they're going to spy on us! I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can! From the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan! Hurry, <class>!Dar'Khan's Lieutenants^20^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Idonis^Magister Idonis^The Sanctum of the Sun^^^Magister Idonis wants you to venture into Deatholme to slay Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter and Mirdoran the Fallen. Report back to him in the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands after you've completed this task.^The odious traitor, Dar'Khan, has risen to great power among the ranks of the Scourge. His lieutenants command vast armies of undead against our dwindling numbers. Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter, Mirdoran the Fallen. Learn these names well for in the Ghostlands these Scourge leaders are second only to Dar'Khan himself. Slay them and their mindless armies will be thrown into disarray.Culinary Crunch^15^Horde^Ghostlands^Master Chef Mouldier^Master Chef Mouldier^^^^Collect 5 Crunchy Spider Legs and return them to Master Chef Mouldier at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^This is intolerable! I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station. No? But I get here and there is no food. You must go out, <class>, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare. Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food. There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar. Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with.Report to Magister Kaendris^16^Horde^Ghostlands^Ranger Vynna^Magister Kaendris^The Farstrider Enclave^^^Bring Dar'Khan's Journal to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands.^The magisters at the Sanctum of the Sun have made great progress in analyzing the Scourge's weaknesses with the aid of the Forsaken. Magister Kaendris will know what to do with this information. You'll find the Sanctum of the Sun southwest of here. You must hurry, <name>. Dar'Khan is a cunning enemy and watches our every move!Retaking Windrunner Spire^15^Horde^Ghostlands^High Executor Mavren^High Executor Mavren^^^^Slay 8 Deatholme Acolytes and 10 Fallen Rangers, and return to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^<class>, I want you to reclaim Windrunner Spire! It's an honor, really. Windrunner Spire is the original home of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, queen of the Forsaken and former ranger-general of the elves. But now it's been overrun by the mindless Scourge. To get there take the road south until it branches. Take the right fork and after crossing the Dead Scar continue southwest. You can't miss it.Vanquishing Aquantion^13^Horde^Ghostlands^Geranis Whitemorn^Geranis Whitemorn^Forgotten Rituals^^^Geranis Whitemorn wants you to swim to the bottom of the lake east of Suncrown Village and use the Bundle of Medallions on the Altar of Tidal Mastery. Summon and slay the elemental known as Aquantion and return to Geranis.^That willful elemental ended many lives that fateful day when he revolted against us. By calling to the lowly murloc to sabotage our rites he subverted our magic and turned it against us. Show him our thirst for vengeance has not waned! Take these medallions and lay them at the Altar of Tidal Mastery at the bottom of the lake. Aquantion shall immediately answer your summons! Beware, <race>! Without our magic controlling him, his wrath will be unrestrained. Destroy Aquantion so we may rest!The Lady's Necklace^15^Horde^Ghostlands^The Lady's Necklace^High Executor Mavren^^^Journey to Undercity^Take The Lady's Necklace to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner herself! Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking Forsaken in the area and is sure to know what to do with it.The Twin Ziggurats^17^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Kaendris^Magister Kaendris^The Farstrider Enclave^^^Travel to the Bleeding Ziggurat and the Howling Ziggurat and recover the Stone of Light and the Stone of Flame. Return to Magister Kaendris at the Sanctum of the Sun after recovering the items.^According to this journal, Dar'Khan promised the Scourge two powerful elven artifacts: the stone of light and the stone of flame. These were imbued with the magical energies of the Sunwell and attuned to have warding powers against the Scourge. The crystals were to be transported to where the Howling Ziggurat and the Bleeding Ziggurat now stand, in the middle of the Dead Scar. If they're still held there, we need to recover them. Their power will be greatly useful in our struggle against the enemy.Craftsman's Writ - Dense Weightstone^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Craftsman's Writ - Dense Weightstone^Packmaster Stonebruiser^^^^Deliver 120 Dense Weightstones and the Craftsman's Writ - Dense Weightstone - to Packmaster Stonebruiser at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^The bearer of this writ is entitled to payment in the form of an insignia of their choice upon completion of the contracted work order.

It appears to be a gift to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner from her sister, Alleria! You must take it to her in the Undercity at once! The lady holds court in the Royal Quarter. To get there, use the orb of translocation in the Inner Sanctum of Sunfury Spire in Silvermoon City to cross over to the Undercity. Once there, take the elevator ride down into the city proper. Use your maps if you need help finding the Royal Quarter.Craftsman's Writ - Volcanic Hammer^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Craftsman's Writ - Volcanic Hammer^Packmaster Stonebruiser^^^^Deliver 3 Volcanic Hammers and the Craftsman's Writ - Volcanic Hammer - to Packmaster Stonebruiser at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^The bearer of this writ is entitled to payment in the form of an insignia of their choice upon completion of the contracted work order.

However, I have instructions that must be delivered to the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest. Advisor Sorrelon represents us to the Forsaken there. The shortest route, barring the use of their flying bats, is to leave Undercity and take the road south. Follow the signposts. Finding the place shouldn't be difficult. Brace yourself, though; the Sepulcher itself is a dilapidated crypt. These Forsaken are certainly odd creatures.Craftsman's Writ - Runecloth Boots^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Craftsman's Writ - Runecloth Boots^Packmaster Stonebruiser^^^^Deliver 8 Runecloth Boots and the Craftsman's Writ - Runecloth Boots - to Packmaster Stonebruiser at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^The bearer of this writ is entitled to payment in the form of an insignia of their choice upon completion of the contracted work order.

I don't need to remind you how important those mines are to us as a strategic asset in our ongoing campaign here in the Ghostlands! Take the south road out of town and follow the fork to the right. Just past the ziggurat on the right there will be a short dirt path to the west. Follow it. The ore must flow!Investigate the Amani Catacombs^17^Horde^Ghostlands^Advisor Valwyn^Advisor Valwyn^^^^Investigate the Amani Catacombs and burn 10 Mummified Troll Remains, then return to Advisor Valwyn at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^<class>, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside Sungraze Peak have been rising from the dead. Dame Auriferous would have you investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising. The fastest way there is to head north out of town and then take the first fork to the right. This will put you on the north side of the peak, so look to the south for the entrance.Craftsman's Writ - Runecloth Robe^60^All^Eastern Plaguelands^Craftsman's Writ - Runecloth Robe^Packmaster Stonebruiser^^^^Deliver 8 Runecloth Robes and the Craftsman's Writ - Runecloth Robe - to Packmaster Stonebruiser at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^The bearer of this writ is entitled to payment in the form of an insignia of their choice upon completion of the contracted work order.

I want you to go there and bring back proof of their final demise. Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source.

It is a thin sheen of protective magic that covers certain pieces of equipment. Those that do battle with creatures of frost and ice will gain increased protection from their attacks by using the Ice Guard. As with all things the Wrathcaster creates, there is a price - a price that I will not lower, regardless of how much you whimper. Interested?Escape from the Catacombs^17^Horde^Ghostlands^Ranger Lilatha^Captain Helios^^^^Escort Ranger Lilatha to Captain Helios at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^These trolls ambushed me and have been keeping me in this cage.

Return them to Captain Helios at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^<class>, I want you to kill as many Shadowpine trolls as you can. We need their numbers greatly reduced before we can shift our attention toward Deatholme. And while you're at it, we might as well kill two birds with one stone, so bring me back a load of their weapons. Better that they not go to waste, and we can use them in the fight against the Scourge. Hit their camps hard to the east and the south at Zeb'Tela and Zeb'Nowa.Bring Me Kel'gash's Head!^20^Horde^Ghostlands^Wanted Poster: Kel'gash the Wicked^Captain Helios^^^^Return the Head of Kel'gash the Wicked to Captain Helios at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^WANTED: Bring the head of Kel'gash the Wicked, chieftain of the Shadowpine trolls, to Captain Helios.

They might just be on to something, <name>. With the proper treatment, the hearts of the unliving can produce potent elixirs. Hunt down the zombies that roam the Dead Scar and bring me their hearts. I'll show you the kind of enhancement we can perform to your physical prowess against the undead.Spinal Dust^18^Horde^Ghostlands^Magistrix Aminel^Magistrix Aminel^^^More Spinal Dust^Bring back 10 Spinal Dusts to Magistrix Aminel in Tranquillien.^The dark energy that flows through the bodies of reanimated skeletons tends to accumulate primarily in their spine. I've discovered a method of instilling this energy into a potion that boosts our magical abilities against the undead. Bring me some spinal dust and I'll be glad to provide you with a sample. You'll find an ample number of skeletons wandering the Dead Scar, west of here.War on Deatholme^20^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Idonis^Magister Idonis^The Sanctum of the Sun^^A Restorative Draught^Slay 5 Eyes of Dar'khan, 6 Nerubis Centurions and 6 Wailers in Deatholme and return to Magister Idonis at the Sanctum of the Sun in the Ghostlands.^If you seek to aid our cause there is no better place to start than here and no better time to do it than now.

He has left Ahn'Qiraj but the base of Atiesh remains.

Our defenses are barely holding and there's no sign of reinforcements from Silvermoon City. Lend us a hand in defending the village by thinning the numbers of the undead roaming the Dead Scar nearby.Runewarden Deryan^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ranger Sareyn^Runewarden Deryan^Runewarden Deryan^Defending Fairbreeze Village^^Speak to Runewarden Deryan in Eversong Woods, near the border with the Ghostlands.^This increase in Scourge attacks leads me to believe there might be a malfunction at one of the protective runestones at the border with the Ghostlands. We used these ancient stones to protect us against the undead. Most of them were destroyed or lost after the attack on the Sunwell. Follow the road south, towards the Ghostlands, and look to the west for a small path. You will find Runewarden Deryan by the runestone nearby; he will know whether anything's wrong.The Wayward Apprentice^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider^Apprentice Mirveda^The Wayward Apprentice^^^Speak to Apprentice Mirveda at the East Sanctum in Eversong Woods.^Thank you for your help, <name>. While I get things back in order here, I'd like to ask you for a favor. One of my former apprentices embarked in a very dangerous line of research. She journeyed to the East Sanctum, in the middle of the Dead Scar. I worry for her well-being. See if you can find her and convince her to return to her senses.Research Notes^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Mirveda^Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider^Unexpected Results^^Saltheril's Haven^Deliver the Research Notes to Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods.^As discouraging as my research results are, they still contain valuable data.

Defeat the entity that is exorcised from the staff and return to him.^This final task will be the most difficult of all, <name>. You have faced and defeated both an Old God and the Lich King's General, but now you must face the hand of Sargeras. Take the staff to Stratholme.

Place the befouled staff upon the holy ground and prepare for an entity of immense power to break from within... Defeat the demonic being that controls the staff and return to me.The Scorched Grove^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ardeyn Riverwind^Larianna Riverwind^The Scorched Grove^^^Find Larianna Riverwind near the Scorched Grove in the southwest of Eversong Woods.^A foul taint in the soil precedes the expansion of the Scourge into a new area. The protective runestones along the border with the Ghostlands have warded the land against this taint in the past. The westernmost runestone was destroyed during a Scourge attack, which forced us to burn the ground around it to prevent the taint from spreading. My sister, Larianna Riverwind, watches over the Scorched Grove. Go find her; she might have some work for you.Investigate the Scourge of Stormwind^6^Alliance^Scourge Invasion^Lieutenant Orrin^Lieutenant Orrin^^^^Collect three Dim Necrotic Stones from the Scourge outside Stormwind and investigate the glowing runic circles near their encampment.^The Lich King has sent his undead upon our very doorstep; we cannot remain idle! Surely you will step up to defend Stormwind from these accursed invaders? There are strange runic circles outside, glowing with the same energy that surrounds the undead and the Necropolis above. They have significance, I'm certain, and I want you to find out what. Thin the numbers of those aberrations while you're at it; bring me proof of their death along with your results, and I will reward you. Go!Investigate the Scourge of the Undercity^8^Horde^Scourge Invasion^Lieutenant Rukag^Lieutenant Rukag^^^^Collect three Dim Necrotic Stones from the Scourge outside the Undercity and investigate the glowing runic circles near their encampment.^The Lich King has sent his undead upon our very doorstep; we cannot remain idle!

The poor souls were victims of a tragic incident in which scores of them drowned at the bottom of the lake. The details of the event are mostly forgotten, but their haunting cries serve as a constant reminder of their curse. If you're up to the task, I want you to go to the lake and put an end to their suffering, <name>. You will have my gratitude as well as theirs... I'm sure.A Little Dash of Seasoning^19^Horde^Ghostlands^Apothecary Venustus^Apothecary Venustus^^^^Poison the Troll foodstuff at the camps in Zeb'Nowa and then return to Apothecary Venustus at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^I'm on loan to the Farstriders in an attempt to help with their troll difficulties. I believe that I have a solution to their problem. At my disposal are a number of potent poisons. The trolls, as you know, are living creatures and therefore must eat. If we combine my poison with their food... well, I'm sure that the results will be entertaining! Care to help rid us of the Shadowpine trolls at Zeb'Nowa to the south? The camp straddles both the north and south sides of the road to Zul'Aman.Attack on Zeb'Tela^18^Horde^Ghostlands^Farstrider Solanna^Farstrider Solanna^Attack on Zeb'Tela^^^Kill 8 Shadowpine Shadowcasters and 8 Shadowpine Headhunters, and return to Farstrider Solanna at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^Our resources are spread pretty thin here, <class>, so your help is going to be invaluable. The captain has tasked me with overseeing the harassment of the local Shadowpine troll camps. We have a policy of keeping them off balance until the day when we can launch a brutal offensive to wipe them out. Until then, we need all of the volunteers that we can get so that those Shadowpine troll numbers are decreased. Think you could head east to Zeb'Tela and hurt them a little?Assault on Zeb'Nowa^19^Horde^Ghostlands^Farstrider Solanna^Farstrider Solanna^Attack on Zeb'Tela^^^Kill 10 Shadowpine Catlords and 10 Shadowpine Hexxers, and return to Farstrider Solanna at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^Time for something a little more challenging. Zeb'Nowa, to the south, is where the more powerful Shadowpine trolls make their home. In our continuing effort to keep the troll numbers to a minimum I'm dispatching you to go down there and assail them by whatever means you have at your disposal. What do you say, <name>? Ready to deal with some more trolls?You Survived!^1^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Megelon^Proenitus^You Survived!^^^Speak with Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^Nevermind my injuries, <brother /sister>. It's a miracle that any of us are alive! It didn't look like you'd pull through; you've been in suspension for weeks. Something happened and the Exodar crashed. Many have died. But I'm relieved that you are alive, <name>. With you leading our efforts, I'm sure we'll get to safety soon! Proenitus asked me to send you to him when you awoke. He's waiting for you at the bottom of the hill. Just follow the path southwest.Replenishing the Healing Crystals^1^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Proenitus^Proenitus^You Survived!^^Urgent Delivery!^Acquire 8 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby Vale Moths and give them to Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^Our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals. We must replenish them quickly! Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths. Their blood will make for a suitable substitute. The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but they are mostly concentrated in the northwest.Clearing the Way^18^Horde^Ghostlands^Apprentice Vor'el^Apprentice Vor'el^^^^Apprentice Vor'el at Andilien Estate in the Ghostlands wants you to slay 10 Greater Spindlewebs and 10 Ghostclaw Ravagers.^Magister Kaendris sent me down here to clear the area of any hostile wildlife. Once this area is secured, the magisters plan to turn it into some sort of advance outpost against the Scourge. Now if there's one thing I've learned as an apprentice it's to delegate responsibility - especially in matters that endanger one's life! If you're interested, I'll pay you well to kill the greater spindlewebs and ghostclaw ravagers to the west and south of here.The Farstrider Enclave^16^Horde^Ghostlands^Magister Kaendris^Ranger Vynna^The Farstrider Enclave^^^Magister Kaendris, at the Sanctum of the Sun, wants you to talk to Ranger Vynna at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.^Magisters and Farstriders may not see eye to eye all the time, <name>. When it comes to Dar'Khan, however, we're all in agreement that a way must be found to defeat him and his legions. Ranger Vynna, at the Farstrider Enclave northeast of here, has come across important information regarding our enemy. Speak to her and see if you can be of assistance.Rescue the Survivors!^2^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Zalduun^Zalduun^^Urgent Delivery!^^Use your Gift of the Naaru ability on one of the Draenei Survivors spread throughout Ammen Vale, then return to Zalduun at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^The healing crystals are replenished, but that is not the only way we can help the injured. All draenei can tap the gift of the Naaru to heal. You must use this ability to heal one of the crash survivors. You'll find most of the survivors in the areas to the west and northwest, but the crash scattered us all over the vale. The survivors have suffered from exposure to the irradiated power crystals, so you should be able to find them by the red glow that surround them. You must save them, <name>.Cracked Necrotic Crystal^1^Alliance^Scourge Invasion^Faint Necrotic Crystal^Lieutenant Orrin^^^^Bring the Cracked Necrotic Crystal to Lieutenant Orrin outside the gates of Stormwind.^On the corpse of the fallen abomination, you discover a cracked crystal, slowly pulsing with necrotic energy.What Must Be Done...^2^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^^^Gather 10 Lasher Samples and return them to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^The nearby lake has been contaminated by one of the ship's power crystals. Many of the plants and animals of Ammen Vale have been mutated because of this. I have a theory on how to heal the lake, but I must have samples from the mutated lashers for analysis. They can be found to the west in the Ammen Fields. Will you help me, <class>?Healing the Lake^3^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^^Vindicator Aldar^Disperse the Neutralizing Agent at the Irradiated Power Crystal, then return to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^Thank goodness, I think it'll work! I have an agent for you to spread at Silverline Lake to the south. It will neutralize the effects of the irradiated ship's power crystal that fell there. Swim out and scatter the neutralizing agent near it. Don't worry, you won't be exposed long enough to become irradiated.Letter from the Front^45^All^Scourge Invasion^A Torn Letter^Keeper of the Rolls^^^^Take the Torn Letter to the Keeper of the Rolls at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You found this letter on one of the many Scourge minions you've slain. From its appearance and smell, it has been with the undead for some time. Perhaps someone at Light's Hope Chapel would be interested in examining it further...Note from the Front^45^All^Scourge Invasion^A Careworn Note^Keeper of the Rolls^^^^Take the Careworn Note to the Keeper of the Rolls at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You found this letter on one of the many Scourge minions you've slain. From its appearance and smell, it has been with the undead for some time. Perhaps someone at Light's Hope Chapel would be interested in examining it further...Page from the Front^45^All^Scourge Invasion^A Ragged Page^Keeper of the Rolls^^^^Take the Ragged Page to the Keeper of the Rolls at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You found this letter on one of the many Scourge minions you've slain. From its appearance and smell, it has been with the undead for some time. Perhaps someone at Light's Hope Chapel would be interested in examining it further...Envelope from the Front^45^All^Scourge Invasion^A Bloodstained Envelope^Keeper of the Rolls^^^^Take the Bloodstained Envelope to the Keeper of the Rolls at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You found this letter on one of the many Scourge minions you've slain. From its appearance and smell, it has been with the undead for some time. Perhaps someone at Light's Hope Chapel would be interested in examining it further...Missive from the Front^45^All^Scourge Invasion^A Crumpled Missive^Keeper of the Rolls^^^^Take the Crumpled Missive to the Keeper of the Rolls at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You found this letter on one of the many Scourge minions you've slain. From its appearance and smell, it has been with the undead for some time. Perhaps someone at Light's Hope Chapel would be interested in examining it further...Inoculation^4^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Vindicator Aldar^Vindicator Aldar^Vindicator Aldar^^The Missing Scout^Use the Inoculating Crystal on 6 Nestlewood Owlkin. Then return to Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^Zhanaa needs our help to salvage parts from the Exodar. Taerix prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood owlkin that live in the area of a lot of the salvage. Just get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them. Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others. You'll find the owlkin at Nestlewood Thicket and Nestlewood Hills to the southeast.Document from the Front^45^All^Scourge Invasion^A Smudged Document^Keeper of the Rolls^^^^Take the Smudged Document to the Keeper of the Rolls at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.^You found this letter on one of the many Scourge minions you've slain. From its appearance and smell, it has been with the undead for some time. Perhaps someone at Light's Hope Chapel would be interested in examining it further...Spare Parts^4^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Technician Zhanaa^Technician Zhanaa^^^^Collect 4 Emitter Spare Parts and then return to Technician Zhanaa at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^We managed to recover a damaged holographic emitter from the crash. If we repair it, we'll have a chance to find other survivors outside of Ammen Vale. There were devices from the ship that could be salvaged for spare parts in the area, but the local owlkin carried them off before we could get to them. <name>, you must go south to Nestlewood Thicket and Hills to find the spare parts.The Missing Scout^5^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Vindicator Aldar^Tolaan^The Missing Scout^Inoculation^^Find and speak with Tolaan at Shadow Ridge in Ammen Vale.^We now have several separate confirmations of unusual activity up on the Shadow Ridge. This is disturbing; we thought that the scouting missions already undertaken had been thorough. One of my scouts hasn't reported back yet. <class>, I need you to head southwest to the other side of Silverline Lake and find Tolaan, and see what has delayed him.Faint Necrotic Crystal^1^Horde^Scourge Invasion^Faint Necrotic Crystal^Lieutenant Rukag^^^^Bring the Faint Necrotic Crystal to Lieutenant Rukag in the courtyard of the Undercity.^On the corpse of the fallen wight, you find a crystal faintly radiating necrotic energy.Blood Elf Spy^5^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Tolaan^Vindicator Aldar^The Missing Scout^^The Emitter^Slay Surveyor Candress and then inform Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^I have a plan. We must kill their leader. Without their master, perhaps they will retreat to regroup. We just need to buy time until the repairs are completed. Then Vindicator Aldar must know of this. Kill the surveyor, then return and tell him what we've found.The Emitter^5^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Vindicator Aldar^Technician Zhanaa^^Blood Elf Spy^Travel to Azure Watch^Speak with Technician Zhanaa at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^<name>, while you were out investigating the Shadow Ridge, Zhanaa here has been going on about the holographic emitter. You might want to speak with her.Travel to Azure Watch^5^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Technician Zhanaa^Technician Dyvuun^^The Emitter^^Speak with Technician Dyvuun at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle.^By all that is good, <name>, you must go at once to this Azure Watch and speak with Dyvuun! There is a path that leads west off of this tiny isle. Follow it and cross the Crystalbrook River to arrive on the larger part of the isle. Continue to follow the path and you should find Azure Watch. See if you can convince them to send us some aid and supplies. The rest of us will follow when we can. Thank you, we wouldn't have made it without you!Word from Azure Watch^5^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Aeun^Caregiver Chellan^^^^Speak with Caregiver Chellan at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle.^<class>! A couple mutated beasts jumped me and my leg is injured. I was sent on a scouting mission from Azure Watch after we received word from Zhanaa. Please, could you go speak with Caregiver Chellan in my stead? She needs to know how many people to expect in Azure Watch. Just cross the Crystalbrook River here and continue following the road until you get to Azure Watch. Be sure to ask her for a place for yourself to stay in.Anok'suten^11^Horde^Ghostlands^Dying Blood Elf^Arcanist Vandril^^Return to Arcanist Vandril^^Slay Anok'suten and return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^Come closer, I am ... dying. I was sent here ... to slay these Nerubians, but Vandril didn't ... know that they have a leader. <The dying blood elf coughs up a good amount of blood.> You must find and ... slay Anok'suten. Get help. She wanders around ... Suncrown Village.The Forsaken^10^Blood Elf^Ghostlands^Arcanist Vandril^High Executor Mavren^The Forsaken^^Goods from Silvermoon City, Return to Arcanist Vandril^Speak with High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^I know it seems strange, but these Forsaken are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren. He's in the tower on the west side of town. And, <class>, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately!Hero of the Sin'dorei^21^Blood Elf^Ghostlands^Magister Kaendris^Lor'themar Theron^Hero of the Sin'dorei^The Traitor's Destruction^^Take Dar'Khan's Head to Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.^This is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of our race, <name>. Our lands will be reclaimed and we shall cement our bond with Sylvanas and her allies. Take the traitor's head to Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City. He'll be eager to hear the news.The Forsaken^10^Orc, Undead,^Ghostlands^Arcanist Vandril^High Executor Mavren^The Forsaken^^Return to Arcanist Vandril^Speak with High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^I know it seems strange, but the Forsaken are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren. He's in the tower on the west side of town. And, <class>, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately!The Great Fissure^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Falcon Watch^^^Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch wants you to slay 8 Stonescythe Whelps and 3 Stonescythe Alphas at the Great Fissure, east of Falcon Watch.^We're dangerously close to becoming fenced in by Alliance forces. With the influx of sin'dorei pilgrims from Azeroth, we must establish a route that's safe from our enemies' prying eyes. I've given it some thought and have arrived at a solution. We're to establish a secret path through the Great Fissure. Yes, even though the area is crawling with brutal rock flayers, they are merely beasts and can be taught to fear us. I want you to go and kill a good number of them. They shall learn fear.A Hasty Departure^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Far Seer Regulkut^Grelag^A Hasty Departure^^^Far Seer Regulkut wants you to track down her student Grelag.^Greetings, <name>. Outland is a perilous place, as many of our expedition quickly learned. I'm afraid young Grelag may have learned that lesson firsthand. Grelag is a promising student, but he lacks patience! He eagerly studies the history of his people, but he sometimes forgets the threats of the present day. He departed for the Spinebreaker Post, ignorant of the Legion and fel orc presences. I fear something may have happened to him.Preparing the Salve^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Grelag^Grelag^A Hasty Departure^^^Gather 12 Hellfire Spineleaf plants for a salve and return to Grelag at Spinebreaker Post.^Just as Zeth'Gor came into view, a Legion patrol caught sight of me. I ran, hoping to duck into one of the towers in the distance, but one of their felhounds caught up with me and nearly hamstrung me! I managed to escape, but my leg is in terrible shape. Stone Guard Ambelan found me and brought me here. Now, I have to find a way to tend to my leg. Spineleaf grows in and around the Valley of Bones to the north . A salve made from it will dull the pain enough for me to travel.Ravager Egg Roundup^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Legassi^Legassi^Ravager Egg Roundup^^^Retrieve 12 Ravager Eggs for Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash in Hellfire Peninsula.^I'm starving! There's irony in that, wouldn't you say? A starving cook? <Legassi laughs half-heartedly and taps a folded piece of parchment he has in his pocket.> According to this tourist map we were following - before we were so rudely shot down - there's an area to the southwest, near Terokkar Forest. It's called the Razorthorn Trail, and supposedly it's brimming with delicious ravager eggs! I could cook up quite a feast if only someone were brave enough to go down there and get me some!Voidwalkers Gone Wild^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^"Screaming" Screed Luckheed^"Screaming" Screed Luckheed^In Case of Emergency...^^^Bring 10 Condensed Voidwalker Essences to "Screaming" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash.^Even if I can get the zeppelin's frame repaired, I'll have to find something else to power the engine. I'm all out of fuel and there's no place to fill up around here! To the south of us is an area of broken land called the Warp Fields. It's full of rogue and uncontrolled voidwalkers, but I like to think of them as walking batteries. If you can bring me enough of their essence, I can convert the zeppelin's engine to run on it. Five gold says I'll even get better mileage out of it, too!Darnassian Intrusions^6^Horde^Eversong Woods^Aeldon Sunbrand^Ley-Keeper Velania^Report to Aeldon Sunbrand^^^Travel to the West Sanctum, southwest of Falconwing Square and defeat any intruders present there. Report your findings to Ley-Keeper Velania.^Besides the constant threat that the Wretched represent, I also have to deal with all kind of fictitious reports of night elf sightings. Though most reports are unfounded, one recent incident demands further investigation. The West Sanctum, one of our primary energy sources, has suffered a terrible malfunction and rumors of Darnassian sabotage are rampant. Travel there and deal with anyone that looks suspicious. Report back to Ley-Keeper Velania, who watches over the sanctum.A Job for an Intelligent Man^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Biggums^Foreman Biggums^^The Path of Anguish^^Kill 15 Marauding Crust Bursters and return to Foreman Biggums at Honor Hold.^Well met, <class>. Now that reinforcements are finally arriving, we can recapture some semblance of a normal life. One of our first goals is to restore the flow of men and goods along the road to the southwest, but it must be reclaimed from the crust bursters that've overrun the area. If you're willing to help us deal with this menace, you would have the gratitude of the Sons. Watch carefully for the disturbed ground they leave in their wake.Smooth as Butter^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Legassi^Legassi^Ravager Egg Roundup^^^Bring 12 Plump Buzzard Wings to Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash.^Screed likes to say his flying is as "smooth as butter." I think "butterfingered" is more like it! Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a "rough" landing. Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often! I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs.Ranger Sareyn^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Marniel Amberlight^Ranger Sareyn^^^^Report to Ranger Sareyn outside Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods.^Don't take the safety of this village for granted. We're under siege by the Scourge on the east and the Wretched to the west. Ranger Sareyn keeps our borders safe from the undead that pour in from the Dead Scar. Follow the road eastwards out of town and see if you can lend her a hand.Farstrider Retreat^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Ranger Degolien^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Farstrider Retreat^Situation at Sunsail Anchorage^^Report to Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods.^Your help in subduing the Wretched has been invaluable. The Farstriders would surely have use for someone like you in their fight against the Amani trolls. Look for the Farstrider Retreat to the northeast of here, speak to Lieutenant Dawnrunner and see what assistance she might need.Amani Invasion^11^Horde^Eversong Woods^Amani Invasion Plans^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Amani Invasion^^^Deliver the Amani Invasion Plans to Lieutenant Dawnrunner at Farstrider Retreat.^Though you don't understand the language in these battle plans, you clearly make out a map marking the positions of the Farstrider Retreat and Fairbreeze Village. You'd best let Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat know about this.Helboar, the Other White Meat^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Legassi^Legassi^Ravager Egg Roundup^^^Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash wants you to gather 8 Purified Helboar Meat. To purify the meat, use the Purification Mixture on the Tainted Helboar Meat you gather from Helboars.^Those eggs are superb, but what do you say we kick it up another notch? A side of bacon would round out the meal perfectly and I know just where to get it. This place is littered with helboars. Of course, there's no one here to inspect and tenderize the meat, but we're in luck! <Legassi rummages around in his pack and produces a flask.> This wasn't made for use on pork, but cooking is as much about improvisation as anything else!Warlord Krellian^60^All^Mage^Archmage Xylem^Archmage Xylem^Warlord Krellian^^^Retrieve the Prismatic Shell for Archmage Xylem. The Archmage resides in a tower atop the cliffs of Azshara.^There isn't much time, <name>! My scrying spells have revealed a powerful source of magic. I cannot leave the tower, and would ask you to kill the vile creature in possession of this artifact. The pathetic little cretin is known as Warlord Krellian, hiding behind his guards in the Temple of Zin-Malor. Burn him to ashes and take the prismatic shell he covets so dearly.Warning Fairbreeze Village^11^Horde^Eversong Woods^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Ranger Degolien^Amani Invasion^^^Travel to Fairbreeze Village in Eversong Woods and speak to Ranger Degolien.^Go to Fairbreeze Village and notify Ranger Degolien of the Amani plans. Even with Zul'Marosh dead, Fairbreeze must prepare for a troll attack. Tell Degolien I will send him reinforcements as soon as possible.Fragmented Magic^60^All^Mage^Archmage Xylem^Archmage Xylem^Warlord Krellian^^^Polymorph the Spitelash of Azshara and kill the clones that appear several seconds later. When you have slain 50 Polymorph Clones, return to Archmage Xylem in Azshara.^My research has revealed a unique purpose for the prismatic shell. Carry the shell and cast your polymorph spell on the Spitelash in Azshara. If you wait a few moments, the chaotic aura of the shell will cause them to split into several smaller clones for a few moments. Kill these clones as quickly as possible, and the shell will collect their essence. When the shell is full, return it to me.In Need of Felblood^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ryathen the Somber^Ryathen the Somber^In Need of Felblood^^^Ryathen the Somber at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 6 Felblood Samples from the Terrorfiends that inhabit the Pools of Aggonar.^Northeast of here lie the Pools of Aggonar. Once a sacred site to the draenei, their waters were corrupted after the blood from the demon Aggonar was spilled into them. That blood, though old and diluted, still possesses tremendous power. Terrorfiends now walk the area, empowered by the pure demonic energies of the original blood. Slay them and retrieve as much felblood as you can. I'll make it worth your while.Replenishing the Healing Crystals^1^Human, Dwarf,^Azuremyst Isle^Proenitus^Proenitus^Replenishing the Healing Crystals^^Urgent Delivery!^Acquire 8 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby Vale Moths and bring them to Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^We are the draenei. Our ship crashed and, since we have many wounded, our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals. We must replenish them quickly! Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths. Their blood will make for a suitable substitute. The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but mostly in the northwest.The Cleansing Must Be Stopped^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ryathen the Somber^Ryathen the Somber^In Need of Felblood^^^Place the Signaling Gem near the Altar of Aggonar at the Pools of Aggonar and defeat any Draenei Anchorites that respond to your summons. Return to Ryathen the Somber at Falcon Watch with the Signaling Gem after completing this task.^Our scouts captured a draenei paladin at the Pools of Aggonar. He was to take part in a cleansing ritual to purify the pools. We must stop the draenei from succeeding or we will lose our supply of felblood! He was carrying this signaling gem, looking to mark a spot where a priest - or "anchorite" as they call themselves - could perform their rituals in safety. Place the gem near the Altar of Aggonar and be ready to ambush any approaching draenei. I suggest that you take a friend or two along.Botanist Taerix^2^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Proenitus^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^Urgent Delivery!^^Speak with Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^<name>, Botanist Taerix is in need of your assistance. You'll find her with her apprentices to the west, outside the ship.Demonic Contamination^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Thiah Redmane^Thiah Redmane^Helping the Cenarion Post^^^Thiah Redmane, at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula, has asked you to gather 6 Helboar Blood Samples from Hulking Helboars.^Welcome to the Cenarion Post, <class>. We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places. The Cenarion Expedition has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in Outland, and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome.Missing Missive^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Eroded Leather Case^Thiah Redmane^^^^Return the Eroded Leather Case to Thiah Redmane, camped near the Ruins of Sha'naar in western Hellfire Peninsula.^Upon examining the battered leather case, it becomes apparent that the container's damage must've been caused by the caustic fluid of the worm's digestive tract. The leather appears to have been intricately tooled at one time, but the details of its adornment can no longer be made out. The only recognizable feature of the case is a worn logo of the Cenarion Circle. Knowing nothing about the contents of the case, you decide the best course of action would be to deliver it to a Circle member.Arelion's Journal^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Magistrix Carinda^Magistrix Carinda^Arelion's Journal^^^Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to go to the Pools of Aggonar and retrieve Arelion's Journal.^My husband, Arelion, had been fascinated with the Pools of Aggonar ever since we arrived in Outland. He spent much of his time studying slimes, of all things! He went missing in there a few days ago. They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it. One thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him. Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal. He always carried it inside a brown knapsack.The Road to Falcon Watch^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim^Taleris Dawngazer^The Road to Falcon Watch^^^Protect the Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim on her way to Falcon Watch, then speak with Taleris Dawngazer.^<The battered blood elf's face displays relief at your presence.> Please, <class>, get me out of this cage! I foolishly set out from Thrallmar ahead of the main group, despite Martik Tor'seldori's warnings. I was set upon by horrible creatures that could only be the ravagers he talked about. I managed to drive them off, but that was only the beginning of my troubles. As I bound my wounds, those bird men found me, dragged me back to this cave, and locked me in this cage! I must get to Falcon Watch!A Pilgrim's Plight^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Taleris Dawngazer^Taleris Dawngazer^The Road to Falcon Watch^^^The Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim was attacked by Quillfang Ravagers while camped in Dustquill Ravine. Find her camp and search it for the missing pack.^That wounded pilgrim seems to be shouting something about a pack. When you encountered her, did you see a pack nearby? Hmm... She must've left it when fleeing from her attackers. The quillfang ravagers, in their ravine to the south, are known to attack solitary travelers. If she doesn't calm down, I won't be able to tend her wounds. Her stubbornness may just cost her her life. Go to Dustquill Ravine and see if you can find her campsite. I'm willing to bet she left it there.Trueflight Arrows^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Falconer Drenna Riverwind^Falconer Drenna Riverwind^^^^Gather 8 Bonestripper Tail Feathers from Bonestripper Vultures and bring them to Falconer Drenna Riverwind at Falcon Watch.^With the influx of pilgrims and the encroachment of Alliance forces, things around Falcon Watch have gotten quite busy lately. In my spare time, I usually help prepare batches of arrows for the rangers, but I haven't had the chance to gather feathers for the fletching in a long time. I could offer you a bit of coin if you'd be willing to gather the tail feathers of the bonestripper vultures. In the past, I've found them circling the bones of large beasts to the north of Falcon Watch.An Ambitious Plan^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Elsaana^Elsaana^^^^Use the Sanctified Crystal against a wounded Uncontrolled Voidwalker and return to Elsaana at the Temple of Telhamat.^The blood elves epitomize the irresponsible use of magic, <class>. They do not control magical energy. Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their addiction. They consume the energies of Outland's voidwalkers to power their demonic magics. I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the Warp Fields to the southeast of Hellfire Citadel.Rampaging Ravagers^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Gremni Longbeard^Gremni Longbeard^^^^Kill 10 Quillfang Ravagers and return to Gremni Longbeard in Hellfire Peninsula.^So Honor Hold sends us to deal with the arakkoa and we set up camp here thinking hey isn't this a great spot. Little did we know how close we were to the quillfang ravagers. They are relentless predators and have made any sort of work on our part impossible. There's a bit of coin in it for you if you can deal with them for us. Do you feel up to it?Source of the Corruption^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Azethen^Apothecary Azethen^^^^Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar in Hellfire Peninsula and obtain 5 Demonic Essences from the Illidari Taskmasters. Return to Apothecary Azethen at Falcon Watch after you've completed the task.^Uncorrupted draenei, like this unlucky fellow here, are virtuous champions of the Light. What corruption caused their great race to devolve into the Broken and Lost Ones? I've heard a theory that exposure to fel energies is what caused the mutation. I would like to put that theory to the test. Northwest of here lie the Ruins of Sha'naar. There you will find lowly Broken commanded by Illidari taskmasters. Bring me demonic essences from the taskmasters so that I can test them on this draenei.In Search of Sedai^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Anchorite Obadei^Sedai's Corpse^In Search of Sedai^^^Anchorite Obadei wants you to look for his brother, Sedai, nearby to the east in Hellfire Peninsula.^Hear my plight, <class>. My brother, Sedai, left long ago to contact the orcs of Mag'har Post. Ever the idealist, he thought the time was ripe to set our differences aside and negotiate a peace with them. He's been missing for days and I fear for the worst. Would you set my mind to rest and look for him? Sedai must be somewhere nearby to the east.Marking the Path^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Falcon Watch^^^Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch wants you to go to the Great Fissure in Hellfire Peninsula and light the Southern Beacon, Western Beacon and Central Beacon. Return to him with the Lit Torch after you've completed this task.^With the rock flayer population thinned, all that's left is to signal the safe path to our pilgrims. Return to the Great Fissure with this torch and seek the three beacons that mark the path from the east. Light the three beacons and return to me. Be warned that the beacons will attract any nearby rock flayers when you first light them.Rogue Training^1^Blood Elf^Rogue^Magistrix Erona^Pathstalker Kariel^^Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle^Well Watcher Solanian^Speak with Pathstalker Kariel - the Rogue class trainer - inside the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you. For young rogues here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Pathstalker Kariel. Speak with Kariel and see what training he has available for you. The things he will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you. Kariel - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.Hunter Training^1^Blood Elf^Hunter^Magistrix Erona^Ranger Sallina^^Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle^Well Watcher Solanian^Speak with Ranger Sallina - the Hunter class trainer - inside the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you. For young hunters here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Ranger Sallina. Speak with Sallina and see what training she has available for you. The things she will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you. Sallina - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.Where's Wyllithen?^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Apprentice Loralthalis^Groundskeeper Wyllithen^Where's Wyllithen?^^^Find Groundskeeper Wyllithen on the Duskwither Grounds in Eversong Woods.^The Duskwither groundskeeper has gone missing! Someone must have forgotten to tell him to leave when the magister and everyone else did. I know that he's still somewhere around here on the grounds, but I dare not go looking for him myself with all of these magical creatures roaming about. Will you find him for me, <class>, and make sure that he's alright?Saltheril's Haven^9^Horde^Eversong Woods^Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider^Lord Saltheril^Saltheril's Haven^Research Notes^^Speak with Lord Saltheril at Saltheril's Haven in Eversong Woods.^I swear that I'm going to fireball someone if I get one more request from Lord Saltheril concerning supplies for his party! Do I look like a party planner?! Between you and me, that fool and his sycophants are living in denial that we're under attack here! Some of us are actually busy with, oh, I don't know, defending what's left of Quel'Thalas! <class>, would you please head over to Saltheril's Haven and see if you can shut him up? It's just down the road to the west.Magic of the Arakkoa^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Arcanist Calesthris Dawnstar^Arcanist Calesthris Dawnstar^^^^Bring 4 Haal'eshi Scrolls to Arcanist Calesthris Dawnstar at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.^Outland holds many secrets, <name>. It's only a matter of time before we uncover them all. The half-bird, half-man species of the arakkoa possesses ancient arcane knowledge that would aid us greatly in our exploration of this world. Travel to the Den of Haal'esh, south of here. Obtain any magical scrolls that the Haal'eshi might be carrying on them and bring them to me.Birds of a Feather^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Falconer Drenna Riverwind^Falconer Drenna Riverwind^^^^Travel to the Den of Haal'esh in Hellfire Peninsula and search the Kaliri Nests for a Female Kaliri Hatchling. Use the Empty Birdcage to capture it and bring it to Falconer Drenna Riverwind at Falcon Watch.^The Haal'eshi arakkoa have domesticated a beautiful bird species called the kaliri. I've managed to capture a young male and they appear to be trainable. The females are much rarer, but if I had one I could attempt to breed them. She has to be young, though... a hatchling. An older wild bird wouldn't survive in captivity. Take this cage and travel south, to the Den of Haal'esh. Search the nests for eggs that are ready to hatch. If you bring me back a female hatchling, I'll reward you handsomely.Deadly Predators^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Scout Vanura^Scout Vanura^^^^Scout Vanura at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to slay 8 Stonescythe Whelps and 4 Stonescythe Alpha.^The Broken that live in Outland have endured endless violence. It is of little surprise that as soon as the Dark Portal opened they flocked to it in droves with hopes of escaping this land. Unfortunately for our confused brothers and sisters coming from the south, the rock flayers that inhabit the Great Fissure see them as easy prey. Go there and thin the rock flayer population, so that our kin might have a chance.Cruel Taskmasters^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Ikan^Ikan^^^^Slay 4 Illidari Taskmasters at the Ruins of Sha'naar and return to Ikan at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula.^You probably think most Broken are evil, don't you? In reality many just lack guidance. Before I met the Omenai, I too was lost. Our minds suffered terrible pain from the orcs' demonic magic. We are easily confused and taken advantage of. Demons allied with Illidan raid Hellfire daily and capture our kind as slaves. With the Omenai we now have hope. Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar, southwest of here, and slay the Illidari taskmasters so my people may be free!The Assassin^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Fel Orc Corpse^The Assassin^Return to Thrallmar^^Nazgrel wants you to travel to the road north of Hellfire Citadel and look for an assassin named Krun Spinebreaker.^<name>, we recently uncovered a plot to assassinate our envoy to Falcon Watch. Hellfire Citadel learned of our plans to send an expedition there earlier this morning and set up an ambush. Our scouts have informed me that an assassin known as Krun Spinebreaker waits along the road north of the Citadel. Go there and slay this assassin. Show the fel orcs we're not to be trifled with!A Strange Weapon^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Fel Orc Corpse^Nazgrel^The Assassin^^^Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to Nazgrel in Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^You pull the stone axe out of the body to examine it more closely. There's something unusual about the craftsmanship of the weapon. Its origin appears orcish, though the materials aren't like anything you've seen before. Nazgrel might be interested in seeing the weapon.Fetch!^10^Horde^Mage^Instructor Antheol^Instructor Antheol^Fetch!^^The Balnir Farmstead^Dive to the bottom of Stillwhisper Pond and retrieve the Azure Phial for Instructor Antheol.^So... <name> is it? Don't be flattered I know your name, one of my students has been fawning over you and won't shut up. Hmm... if you'd like to impress <her/him>, why don't you do something for me? There's an azure phial at the bottom of the pond behind me. Dive in, retrieve it, and bring it here.The Purest Water^10^Horde^Mage^Instructor Antheol^Instructor Antheol^Fetch!^^^Instructor Antheol wants you to fill the Azure Phial at Elrendar Falls.^Now that you've learned a little lesson, I'll offer you something more substantial. It concerns your ability to defend yourself in close combat. Of course, you should only resort to melee in the most dire of circumstances, but that is no excuse to be unprepared. I can assist you in creating a staff befitting a mage of your learning. Simply take the phial you retrieved for me and fill it at the base of Elrendar Falls. Just follow the river southeast from here.Recently Living^10^Horde^Mage^Instructor Antheol^Instructor Antheol^Fetch!^^^Slay the Eversong Green Keepers until they yield a Living Branch for Instructor Antheol.^You may have noticed the walking trees near Elrendar Falls. As the keepers of nature, they are infused with a primal magic we can reform to our own purposes using the pure water you have already brought to me. Unfortunately, the green keepers are gnarled and twisted creatures, so you may need to kill a few before you find a useable branch.The Warchief's Mandate^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Far Seer Regulkut^The Assassin^^^Bring the Heavy Stone Axe to Far Seer Regulkut at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^As you know, the warchief put his power behind this expedition for one reason. This is the world we came from. This is where our roots lie. This journey means different things to orcs and blood elves. To them it's a search for the promised land. To us it's more like returning home. Whoever made this axe is familiar with the old ways and we must contact them. This is too important for us to use ordinary tracking methods. Show the weapon to Far Seer Regulkut; she will know what to do.The Mag'har^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Gorkan Bloodfist^Nazgrel^The Assassin^^^Deliver the Letter from the Mag'har to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^This news you bring from beyond the Dark Portal... you want us to believe the son of Durotan now rules over the lands beyond it... free from any demonic taint? And that now his people have returned to this world? I hope for your sake that this isn't some manner of joke, <class>. What this means to my people... cannot be described. I must send word to Nagrand at once! Hellscream must hear about this. Take this letter back to your leader in Thrallmar. Tell him the Mag'har welcome them!Through the Dark Portal^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Warlord Dar'toon^Lieutenant General Orion^Through the Dark Portal^^^Travel through the Dark Portal and find Lieutenant General Orion. He awaits your arrival on the other side, in Outland.^For years the Dark Portal loomed silent... forgotten. But it is silent no longer. After stopping the demonic assault here, our forces breached the portal and met the demons on their own ground! Now, we are locked in a savage war, and there are some who think we might not win. So it is our duty, our grim pleasure, to battle the fiends of Outland and ensure our victory, <name>. If you would help us, then report to Lieutenant General Orion at once. He awaits you in the Outland...Urgent Delivery!^2^All^Azuremyst Isle^Proenitus^Zalduun^You Survived!^^Rescue the Survivors!, Botanist Taerix^Deliver the Bundle of Vials to Zalduun at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^Now that you've gathered all that we need to replenish our healing crystals, I need you to deliver the vials to Zalduun, our priest. You'll find him tending to our wounded inside the central chamber of the ship.A Spirit Guide^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Far Seer Regulkut^Gorkan Bloodfist^The Assassin^^^Use the Wolf Totem at the location where you found Krun Spinebreaker's body and follow the Ancestral Spirit Wolf.^Even our best tracking wolves' senses can fail them, <name>. The spirits have a way of seeing the world differently than ours. The being you will call forth will find the person you seek, for they'll be drawn not to their scent but their essence. Go now, <class>, take this totem with you and use it at the location you found the stone axe.Report to Marshal Bluewall^60^Alliance^Silithus^Rifleman Torrig^Marshal Bluewall^Report to Marshal Bluewall^^^Speak with Marshal Bluewall at the Alliance encampment near Hive'Zora.^Are you Marshal Bluewall's new recruits? Of course you are. What are you waiting for? Good soldiers are dying in the desert. Aren't you excited to join them? Now, get going and don't dry out on the way.Report to General Kirika^60^Horde^Silithus^Scout Bloodfist^General Kirika^Report to General Kirika^^^Speak with General Kirika at the Horde encampment near Hive'Regal.^You must be one of General Kirika's new recruits. It's about time you showed up. Bodies wear down quick in the desert. The dwarves have been getting reinforcements daily, and we can't afford to lose ground in our struggle for resources in Silithus. Get your instructions from the General. It's not my job to train you, just find you.The Arakkoa Threat^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Gremni Longbeard^Gremni Longbeard^The Longbeards^^^Gremni Longbeard in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to slay 4 Haal'eshi Windwalkers and 6 Haal'eshi Talonguards.^The arakkoa are smart creatures... smart as any gnome you ever met. They have this way with magic and a violent temper, however. Lately they've taken to attacking Honor Hold patrols, which is why we were sent here. See, Mirren and I are world-famous marksmen, we are! But fowl and game are what we specialize in... not these... lightning-invoking birdmen. So what do you say you give us a hand in this one assignment? You'll find the Den of Haal'esh to the southwest.Avruu's Orb^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Avruu's Orb^Aeranas^^^^Take Avruu's Orb to the Haal'eshi Altar southeast of the Den of Haal'esh in Hellfire Peninsula and give it to Aeranas once he's free.^<As you hold the orb closer to you, you hear a voice address you.> I sense you're not of the arakkoa, so I will attempt to barter for my freedom. My name is Aeranas. I once ruled over the eastern winds. The Haal'eshi mage, Avruu, trapped me inside this orb. Find the altar the arakkoa used to enslave me. It is hidden to the southeast of the arakkoa's den. Approach it with the orb and give it to me once I'm free. In exchange for my liberty I'll reward you with powerful treasure!Scouring the Desert^60^Alliance^Silithus^Marshal Bluewall^Marshal Bluewall^Report to Marshal Bluewall^^^Find and deliver Silithyst to the Silithyst Extractor, then speak with Marshal Bluewall at the Alliance encampment near Hive'Zora.^We recently found out that the Horde has been scavenging the Silithus desert for resources, but paid them little mind. We thought it could not be worth it to station large numbers in this sweltering desert. However, it was discovered the importance of the resources, and now we are scrambling to catch up. If I have your assistance, you must go into the desert and recover the silithyst and return it here.The Finest Down^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Mirren Longbeard^Mirren Longbeard^Gaining Mirren's Trust^^^Mirren Longbeard in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 8 Kaliri Feathers from the various kaliri found in the Den of Haal'esh.^The arakkoa at the Den of Haal'esh, south of here, breed a magnificent species of birds called kaliri. Their feathers would fetch a bundle at the trading posts back in Azeroth. Just think of all the ale I could buy then! Tell you what, you bring me a stack of kaliri feathers and I'll give you my very own hat. What do you say? You'll never find a hat like this one! Do we have a deal?Scouring the Desert^60^All^Silithus^General Kirika^General Kirika^Report to General Kirika^^^Find and deliver Silithyst to the Silithyst Extractor then speak with General Kirika at the Horde encampment near Hive'Regal.^For some time now, we have been tapping the crystal resources of the Silithus desert. The only dangers we faced were from the creatures that made this place their home and the oppressive sand and dust and heat. But now the Alliance seems to have caught on to what we have found here. It is now a race between us to capture the natural resources, and keep them from the other. I need every set of hands that is available. I hope I have yours.Return to Obadei^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Sedai's Corpse^Anchorite Obadei^In Search of Sedai^^Makuru's Vengeance^Return to Anchorite Obadei at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula and inform him of Sedai's death.^With Sedai's death confirmed, you're left with the unpleasant task of returning to Obadei with the grim news.Makuru's Vengeance^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Makuru^Makuru^^Return to Obadei^Atonement^Makuru at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring him 10 Mag'har Ancestral Beads.^Sedai was like a brother to Makuru. We owe him our lives and more! They call Makuru crazy but if the Omenai are not going to do anything about his death then they're the crazy ones! Makuru doesn't have much to call his own in this world, but he will give you his only possession if you avenge Sedai. I've seen the brown orc Mag'har grunts before, up in the hills to the northeast. They hate us! They don't deserve our mercy! Go, avenge Sedai! Bring me their ancestral beads as proof!Report to Tarren Mill^20^Blood Elf^Hillsbrad Foothills^Ambassador Sunsorrow^Advisor Duskingdawn^^^^Travel to Tarren Mill in the Hillsbrad Foothills and speak with Advisor Duskingdawn.^Ah, good to see you here, <class>! I've a task that you are perfectly suited to. As new members of the Horde, we need to make sure that we support their efforts and help them with their problems. That way they'll be more receptive to helping us with ours. Travel to the Forsaken town, Tarren Mill, in the Hillsbrad Foothills to the southeast. Check in with Advisor Duskingdawn when you arrive.The Pools of Aggonar^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Amaan the Wise^Amaan the Wise^The Pools of Aggonar^^^Amaan the Wise wants you to go to the Pools of Aggonar and slay 6 Terrorfiends and 6 Blistering Rots.^Much has changed since the days when we called this land Draenor. Parts of the land have been forever changed by the demons' taint. One such place is known as the Pools of Aggonar. It was once the location of our people's sacred springs. The blood of the demon Aggonar fouled the very essence of the holy waters. This fel blood has spawned foul beings that must be cleansed if we're ever to reclaim the pools. Travel east of here and slay the Terrorfiends and slimes that wander the pools.Cleansing the Waters^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Amaan the Wise^Amaan the Wise^The Pools of Aggonar^^^Amaan the Wise wants you to travel to the Pools of Aggonar and use the Cleansing Vial at Aggonar's corpse. Return to him when Aggonar's essence is cleansed from the water.^I must ask that you finish what we've set in motion. Now that the demonic influence has weakened you must take this cleansing vial and pour it at the very source of the taint - Aggonar's own corpse. You will find the demon's bones at the northern end of the pools. Beware, I sense that Aggonar's essence has not quite left this world.Report to Splintertree Post^20^Blood Elf^Ashenvale^Ambassador Dawnsinger^Advisor Sunsworn^^^^Travel to Splintertree Post in Ashenvale and speak with Advisor Sunsworn.^<The ambassador keeps her voice low as she leans in close.> Your reputation precedes you, <name>. I want you to travel to Splintertree Post in Ashenvale. The easiest way to get there on foot is to travel west through Durotar and the Barrens, and then turn north at the fork in the road. When you arrive, speak with Advisor Sunsworn. Travel carefully; Ashenvale can be a very dangerous place!Travel to Darkshire^20^Draenei^Duskwood^Emissary Taluun^Anchorite Delan^^^^Travel to Darkshire in Duskwood and speak with Anchorite Delan.^I am told that there is a thorn in the side of the kingdom of Stormwind. It is known as Duskwood, and it is a place that is filled with evil and the vile stench of undeath. As we're trying to help as much as we can, I would like for you to travel southeast to the main human settlement there, named Darkshire. Anchorite Delan will be awaiting your arrival.Sha'naar Relics^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Amaan the Wise^Amaan the Wise^Atonement^^^Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar and retrieve 10 Sha'naar Relics.^As I've told you before, I do not require eyes to see what others cannot. I will not pass judgment on what you did on Makuru's behalf, yet I think you need to see beyond what your eyes show you. Travel southwest to the Ruins of Sha'naar and salvage any relics you find. If fate wills it you will find what we need. The meaning of my request might not be immediately apparent. Have faith though, <name>. Clarity comes to those with patience.A Different Approach^28^Horde^Thousand Needles^Magistrix Elosai^Wizlo Bearingshiner^A Different Approach^^^Gather 2 handfuls of Purifying Earth from Thundering Boulderkin and take them to Wizlo Bearingshiner at Whitereach Post.^What's a sin'dorei doing standing on the top of a windswept butte in Thousand Needles instead of the halls of Silvermoon? It's simple. My brethren will no longer have me. Every copy of my treatise on natural cures for our magical addiction was burned. I can safely pursue my research here, but I am without my reagents. If you'd be willing to gather purifying earth from the thundering boulderkin near the western end of the Needles and deliver it to my associate at Whitereach Post, I'd appreciate it.Travel to Astranaar^20^Draenei^Ashenvale^Emissary Valustraa^Vindicator Palanaar^^^^Travel to Astranaar in Ashenvale and speak with Vindicator Palais.^I am glad that you are here to help. In fact, there is something that you can do. As part of our inclusion within the Alliance, I would like for you to travel to the night elf town, Astranaar. It is located in Ashenvale, a large forest that is south of Darkshore on the continent of Kalimdor. Please speak with Vindicator Palais when you arrive to see if there's anything that you can do to help the inhabitants.A Dip in the Moonwell^28^Horde^Thousand Needles^Wizlo Bearingshiner^Wizlo Bearingshiner^A Different Approach^^^Use the Robotron Control while standing near the Concealed Command Console hidden in a small cluster of bushes on the rim of the needle closest to Thalanaar to take command of a Robotron 3000. Pilot the robot to the western edge of Thousand Needles where the Alliance outpost of Thalanaar is located. Use the robot to collect a sample of the moonwell's water and return it to Wizlo Bearingshiner at Whitereach Post.^Stop looking at me like that! I didn't say I was going to send you to Thalanaar's moonwell out in the open with dipper and a flask! I've been, err... tinkering with a product I was transporting for a client. In fact, I've already set up a portable control console for the Robotron out near Thalanaar. You'll need to bring this control unit with you and use it in the vicinity of my concealed console. If my client ever heard that I so much as removed Robotron from its packaging, he'd hang me by my ears!Testing the Tonic^28^Horde^Thousand Needles^Wizlo Bearingshiner^Magistrix Elosai^A Different Approach^^^Deliver the Crate of Reagents to Magistrix Elosai at Freewind Post.^<Wizlo retrieves the water sample from the robot and places it in a crate with the boulderkin earth and several other items.> There you go, that's everything on Magistrix Elosai's list. Tell her that it's been a pleasure working with her and that I wish her luck in her research.Missing Crystals^29^Alliance^Hillsbrad Foothills^Huraan^Huraan^^^^Retrieve the Shipment of Rare Crystals from the Forsaken and return it to Huraan in Southshore.^If there's one great truth about Hillsbrad, it's that this region is destined to live under the shadow of war. Even something as innocuous as a cartload of stone is a target. Normally the loss of building materials is no great setback, but the most recent shipment from the Azurelode mine contained a crate of rare crystals I was eager to study. Forsaken raiders intercepted the cart and drove it northeast to a tower they're attempting to rebuild. It's imperative that we retrieve those crystals, <class>!Bloodscalp Insight^34^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Nemeth Hawkeye^Nemeth Hawkeye^Bloodscalp Insight^^^Nemeth Hawkeye at Grom'gol Base Camp wants you to bring him a Bloodscalp Totem from a Bloodscalp Shaman.^Well met, <class>. I've made a habit of studying the fighting techniques of the various troll tribes in my travels, and I've noticed a trend. The Bloodscalp trolls at the Tkashi Ruins and Bal'lal Ruins to the north use some of the same tactics as the Amani of the northern forests. Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction and they've used it to become the strongest tribe in the area. It could form the core of a powerful weapon against the Amani, but first I must find out more about it.Twilight of the Dawn Runner^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Balandar Brightstar^Balandar Brightstar^^^^Balandar Brightstar in Brackenwall Village wants you to reclaim the Dawn Runner Cargo and rescue his first mate Ithania from forces of Theramore at North Point Tower.^The ogres here are useful for little more than crude jokes, sour ale, and bouts of headbutting. When my ship, the Dawn Runner, ran aground, those curs from Theramore made off with my cargo and last surviving crewman. I made my way here searching for help, but those good-for-nothing ogres stared blankly at me when I told them my story. I could use the help of a reliable <race> in recovering what remains of my cargo and freeing Ithania from North Point Tower, to the northeast, where they're being held.Messenger to Thrall^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Thrall^The Assassin^^Envoy to the Mag'har^Travel to Orgrimmar and give Thrall the Letter from Nazgrel.^The warchief has been waiting for word of this ever since we set foot on Outland. Now you get the honor of giving him the news of the Mag'har yourself. Go quickly, <name>. Take this letter with you; it bears my personal seal. There is nothing that Thrall wants to hear more than the message you bear.Unclaimed Baggage^40^Horde^Badlands^Advisor Sarophas^Advisor Sarophas^^^^Retrieve the Advisor's Pack and Advisor's Rapier from their holding places in the Angor Fortress and return them to Advisor Sarophas at Kargath.^This is Kargath? Oh, dear. I expected a, a... well, some kind of settlement, some sign of civilization here in the wilderness. There must be a mistake; surely this hovel full of uncouth, unwashed, sniggering savages can't be the headquarters of the Expeditionary Force. The loutish barbarians had the gall to laugh at me when I told them about how the Dark Iron dwarves robbed me and then disappeared into the Angor Fortress. I can count on you to help me recover my possessions and my dignity, can't I?Little Morsels^38^Horde^Swamp of Sorrows^Cersei Dusksinger^Cersei Dusksinger^^^^Feed the Fel-Tainted Morsels to the Lost Ones' captured animals. Then return the leftovers to Cersei Dusksinger at Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows.^I'm perfecting a weapon to use against the draenei and you're going to help me! The Lost Ones are the backward cousins of the draenei, and I've been experimenting on them. I just need you to feed some fel-tainted morsels to their captured livestock. In turn, when they slaughter and eat the animals, they'll be cursed! That'll show that stuffy Anchorite Avuun at the Harborage! Go now, hurry! You'll find the Lost Ones and their caged animals to the northeast at the Fallow Sanctuary.Envoy to the Mag'har^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Thrall^Gorkan Bloodfist^^Messenger to Thrall^A Debilitating Sickness^Thrall wants you to return to Gorkan Bloodfist at Mag'har Post in Hellfire Peninsula and offer him your services.^I'd leave for Outland this very minute after hearing the news you brought. Important matters require my attention in Durotar, however. I will arrange for a fitting tribute to be sent to the Mag'har immediately. I will send my most trusted diplomats as well. This will all take time... I need someone to represent us there right now. I must place my trust on you, <name>. Go to the Mag'har Post in Hellfire and render whatever services you can to my kin. Do not fail me, <name>. Too much depends on this.A Debilitating Sickness^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Earthcaller Ryga^Earthcaller Ryga^A Debilitating Sickness^Envoy to the Mag'har^^Earthcaller Ryga at Mag'har Post in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring her 1 Drycap Mushroom from a cave inside the Great Fissure.^It is good that you've offered to aid us, <name>. Our grunts have fallen sick from drinking contaminated water and I'm missing an ingredient to produce a healing salve. I'm in need of a rare mushroom called drycap. Our foremost orders are to keep our location secret and not risk being spotted while looking for it, or I would go myself. The only place in Hellfire Peninsula where drycap grows is a cave at the Great Fissure, south of here. Be extremely careful if you choose to seek it.The So-Called Mark of the Lightbringer^58^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Mehlar Dawnblade^Mehlar Dawnblade^The So-Called Mark of the Lightbringer^^^Obtain the Mark of the Lightbringer and return it to Mehlar Dawnblade at the Bulwark in the Western Plaguelands.^I was once a pupil of Uther Lightbringer, founder of the Knights of the Silver Hand. I saw how he mishandled Prince Arthas's training. It led to the destruction of my homeland, Quel'Thalas, and I blame Uther and his incompetence for all of it! And now he has a tomb in his honor - how lovely. My sources tell me that the scarlet fools are keeping one of his 'holy' relics atop their guard tower near the gates of Hearthglen. Go to the Western Plaguelands and retrieve it for me.Defiling Uther's Tomb^58^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Mehlar Dawnblade^Mehlar Dawnblade^The So-Called Mark of the Lightbringer^^^Defile Uther's Tomb and return to Mehlar Dawnblade at the Bulwark in the Western Plaguelands.^There, that's better. I've added a little fel magic to it. Now, you must take it to his resting place in the Western Plaguelands. Use the corrupted holy symbol in the presence of Uther's statue to defile his tomb! You'll have to get close for it to work. To find the tomb go southeast of the Ruins of Andorhal. Return to me when the deed is done. Be quick about it, <class>!Tomb of the Lightbringer^58^All^Western Plaguelands^Anchorite Truuen^High Priestess MacDonnell^The Mark of the Lightbringer^^^Escort Anchorite Truuen to Uther's Tomb in the Western Plaguelands. Afterward, speak with High Priestess MacDonnell at Chillwind Camp in the Western Plaguelands.^Now that you've recovered the Mark of the Lightbringer, all that is left is to return it to Uther's Tomb. Would you be willing to accompany me there to do this? It's not far and I would enjoy your company. Afterward you can come back here and relate the experience to High Priestess MacDonnell. What say you, <name>?Administering the Salve^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Earthcaller Ryga^Earthcaller Ryga^A Debilitating Sickness^^^Earthcaller Ryga wants you to administer the Healing Salve to 10 Debilitated Mag'har Grunts nearby Mag'har Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^I've prepared a simple salve that should restore our grunts' strength with the herbs you brought me. Take it and administer it to any debilitated grunts you see in the vicinity. Return to me when you're done.Mercy for the Cursed^38^All^Swamp of Sorrows^Anchorite Avuun^Anchorite Avuun^^^^Slay 3 Cursed Lost Ones and then return to Anchorite Avuun at the Harborage in the Swamp of Sorrows.^That blood elf witch, Cersei Dusksinger, has been cursing the Lost Ones, I just know it! I don't know why or how, but the results are tragic. Several of the Lost Ones have now been further corrupted - cursed with even more fel energies! <class>, can you find it in you to take pity on these poor creatures? They should not have to live out the rest of their lives in such a horrible condition. You'll find these cursed Lost Ones at the Fallow Sanctuary, east down the path.Call of Earth^4^Alliance^Shaman^Firmanvaar^Spirit of the Vale^Call of Earth^^^Speak with the Spirit of the Vale at the Sacred Grove in Ammen Vale.^The time has come, <name>. You have grown to the point where you are ready to commune directly with the elemental spirits of this world. But be warned. I can sense that the manner of our entry into this world, and its unfortunate side effects, have angered the earth spirits and caused an imbalance of the elements. If you are to create your earth totem, you must first speak with the Spirit of the Vale. You will find it in the Sacred Grove, nestled in the hills to the northwest.Call of Earth^4^Alliance^Shaman^Spirit of the Vale^Spirit of the Vale^Call of Earth^^^Slay 4 Restless Elements of Earth and then return to the Spirit of the Vale at the Sacred Grove in Ammen Vale.^The balance of the elements has been disrupted by the violent intrusion of the draenei to the Vale. Your crash has caused the spirits of earth to be enraged and turn upon the other elements who have come to quell them. You will learn that an understanding of the elements can only come when all are in harmony. Thus, it falls to you to seek a balance. Behind me in the grove you will find the restless spirits of earth warring upon the other three elements. Help restore the balance.Call of Earth^4^Alliance^Shaman^Spirit of the Vale^Firmanvaar^Call of Earth^^^Deliver the Earth Crystal to Firmanvaar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^I will now give you a piece of my physical being that you may create your earth totem. Return it to he who sent you here. You and I will be bound together for all time. Throughout your life the forces of earth will be at your disposal. The balance will come when your bones return to us at the end of your days. Use our power wisely.Red Snapper - Very Tasty!^6^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Diktynna^Diktynna^Red Snapper - Very Tasty!^^^Use the Draenei Fishing Net to catch 10 Red Snappers. Return both the fish and the net to Diktynna on Azuremyst Isle when the task is complete.^I've found that these waters are bustling with red snapper, a very tasty fish. With a fishing net, I can catch enough to feed dozens of draenei! Unfortunately, I was recently attacked by a creature known as a murloc while netting in the river and have suffered some injuries that prevent me from doing my job. I need help! Use this fishing net near schools of red snapper, found in the Crystalbrook river to the east to catch the fish. What do you say? Remember to return the net when you are finished.Find Acteon!^6^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Diktynna^Acteon^Red Snapper - Very Tasty!^^^Deliver the Crate of Red Snapper to Acteon at Azure Watch.^You did a wonderful job, <name>. Our people will be thankful for this bounty. With that said, would you mind taking this haul of red snapper to Acteon at Azure Watch? He shouldn't be hard to find as he is awaiting this catch.The Great Moongraze Hunt^6^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Acteon^Acteon^The Great Moongraze Hunt^^^Bring 6 Moongraze Stag Tenderloins to Acteon at Azure Watch.^You're starting to make a name for yourself, <name>. How about trying your hand at hunting? Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk. If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat. You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch. Watch out for their horns!Strange Findings^7^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Faintly Glowing Crystal^Exarch Menelaous^Strange Findings^^^Deliver the Faintly Glowing Crystal to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.^The crystal you found on the nightstalker runt's body appears to be a piece of the Exodar. This may help explain the unusual appearance and demeanor of some of the animals in this region. Take the crystal back to Azure Watch. The exarch will surely want to know about this discovery.Nightstalker Clean Up, Isle 2...^8^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Exarch Menelaous^Exarch Menelaous^Strange Findings^^^Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you slay 8 Infected Nightstalker Runts.^I'm not going to make any excuses for what you've found. This is clearly our fault. We had gotten reports of crushed crystal fragments showing up in the river to the east but chose to ignore the implications. Now we can either sit around on this island and cry about the tragedy that has befallen this land or we can do something about it and prevent it from spreading. If you've got the stomach for it, I want you to go back into the wilds and kill as many of the infected nightstalkers as you can find.An Unusual Patron^36^Horde^Stranglethorn Vale^Nemeth Hawkeye^Nemeth Hawkeye^Bloodscalp Insight^^^Use the Gift of Naias near the Altar of Naias to summon the water elemental Naias. Defeat him and return to Nemeth Hawkeye at Grom'gol Base Camp with the Heart of Naias.^So this Naias is the mastermind behind the Bloodscalp and their exotic magic? I'll admit, this is the last place I expected my inquiry to lead, but no matter, our findings may still prove useful. Off the coast to the northwest is an island inhabited by lesser water elementals. There's a crude stone slab there that might serve as an altar for the likes of the trolls. Take the totem you found to that altar. Let's see if we can draw this Naias out and distill his power into a more agreeable form.Combining Forces^12^Horde^Rogue^Keltus Darkleaf^Keltus Darkleaf^Find Keltus Darkleaf^^^Keltus Darkleaf wants you to pickpocket the Lacy Handkerchief from the Sentinel Leader and bring it to him.^Keltus Darkleaf reporting for duty! Oh... who are you, anyhow? If you are here for my report, I insist you help me first. I am planning to attack the sentinel spies, but I intend to send in my faithful Whisper as a first strike. She just needs a scent to hone in on them. Surely someone of your skill could sneak in and steal something from the sentinel leader?Call of Fire^10^All^Shaman^Tuluun^Prophet Velen^Call of Fire^^^Seek out Prophet Velen at the Vault of Lights in the Exodar.^You should know that The Prophet has been asking for you, having heard of your success in your trial. The creation of your fire totem will have to wait until you have spoken with him. This is a rare honor; you must hurry to the Exodar to see him at once!Call of Fire^10^Alliance^Shaman^Sulaa^Tuluun^Call of Fire^^^Speak with Tuluun at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle.^<name>! It is time for you to receive further training in the ways of the spirits. You should seek out Tuluun, the shaman at Azure Watch. He can begin your introduction to understanding and harnessing the power of flame.Medicinal Purpose^6^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Anchorite Fateema^Anchorite Fateema^^^An Alternative Alternative^Anchorite Fateema at Azure Watch wants you to bring her 8 Root Trapper Vines.^I have found that lashers milling about on the island hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment. Unfortunately, with so many injured draenei passing through Azure Watch, we are always in short supply. Our delicate guest was found injured and unconscious by the Crystalbrook only yesterday. If you bring me vines, we may be able to save her. You will find root trappers both south and east of Azure Watch.Call of Fire^10^Alliance^Shaman^Tuluun^Temper^Call of Fire^^^Speak with Temper at Emberglade on Azuremyst Isle.^Once again you are to be tested, and this time the chaotic element of fire must be understood if you're to create a totem to harness its energies. To the northeast on the coast is a sacred place of fire known as Emberglade. Amidst its burned trees stands Temper, a fire elemental of great power, and the one that you must speak with. Go to him now and may the elemental spirits of Azeroth go with you.Call of Fire^10^Alliance^Shaman^Temper^Temper^Call of Fire^^^Retrieve the Ritual Torch and return it to Temper at Emberglade on Azuremyst Isle.^One of my brethren, Hauteur, has gone insane, no doubt because of the crash of your ship. He's begun demanding that the local owlbeasts worship him. This will not continue! None of us would ever impersonate a god! It falls to you to restore the balance. First, you must retrieve their ritual torch, which has been taken by the crazed wildkin inside Stillpine Hold to the west. Return the torch to me.Wanted: Blacktalon the Savage^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Wanted Poster^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^^^^Bring Blacktalon's Claws to Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.^By order of the Ranger Captain, a reward is hereby offered for the slaying of the vicious rockflayer matriarch known as Blacktalon the Savage. Blacktalon was last sighted inside a cave in the Great Fissure. Individuals seeking the reward are to present the creature's claws as proof of the deed.Call of Fire^10^Alliance^Shaman^Temper^Temper^Call of Fire^^Call of Fire^Retrieve Hauteur's Ashes and then return them and the Ritual Torch to Temper at Emberglade on Azuremyst Isle. Remember that you can use the Orb of Returning to teleport back to Temper once you have the ashes.^The owlbeasts of Moonwing Den on Silvermyst Isle, far to the southwest, have been deluded into thinking that Hauteur is a god to be worshipped. What he truly is, is a fallen elemental who needs to be put out of his misery. That torch is the key to his downfall. Hauteur regularly demands that these owlbeasts burn an effigy in his honor. So, when you light it, he will come. Slay him and bring me the ashes. Then use the orb in the satchel that I will give you to return to me here.Call of Fire^10^Alliance^Shaman^Temper^Tuluun^Call of Fire^Call of Fire^^Deliver Hauteur's Ashes to Tuluun at Azure Watch on Azuremyst Isle.^You have done a great thing here today in your pursuit of understanding your relationship to the flame. Remember to always treat it with the utmost respect lest you get burned. I saved a portion of Hauteur's ashes for you. Use them in the creation of your fire totem and remember all that you have learned in their attainment. Now, return to Tuluun.Featherbeard's Endorsement^46^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Ambassador Rualeth^Featherbeard's Journal^Featherbeard's Endorsement^^^Go to Featherbeard's Hovel and visit the dwarf if he is at home. If he is not at home, search for evidence of where he can be found.^When I am finally granted an audience with Falstad Wildhammer, I hope to have our strongest advocate among the Wildhammer dwarves at my side, <name>. Featherbeard is revered among his people, both for his legendary gryphon training skills and for his wisdom. If anyone can sway Falstad Wildhammer, it is he. I would go to see him myself, except that I cannot leave the confines of Aerie Peak while awaiting my audience. Visit Featherbeard at his residence to the south and ask if he will speak with me.A Gesture of Goodwill^46^All^The Hinterlands^Ambassador Rualeth^Ambassador Rualeth^^^^Ambassador Rualeth at Aerie Peak wants you to slay Witch Doctor Mai'jin and his pet spider Tcha'kaz.^The rugged terrain of the Hinterlands is not only home to the Wildhammer dwarves and their gryphons, but also to a number of forest troll tribes. The trolls view the Wildhammers as squatters on their ancestral lands and spare no opportunity to accost the dwarves by attacking the gryphon aeries. One way to prove ourselves in the eyes of the Wildhammer is to help staunch these attacks by killing a Witherbark leader, Witch Doctor Mai'jin, who shelters in a cave at Bogen's Ledge, to the west of Shadra'Alor.Preying on the Predators^44^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Ambassador Rualeth^Ambassador Rualeth^^^^Ambassador Rualeth at Aerie Peak wants you to kill 10 Mangy Silvermane and 5 Silvermane Wolves.^The Wildhammer dwarves act as companions, caretakers, and trainers to the gryphons. The gryphons have no shortage of enemies, especially among the forest troll tribes. Sometimes, though, the threat comes from natural predators, such as wolves. A single animal is no match for a gryphon, but packs have taken to targeting gryphons more often because normal prey is scarce. Culling the wolves can help to reduce their impact on the gryphons and ingratiate us to the Wildhammer.Arelion's Mistress^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Magistrix Carinda^Magistrix Carinda^Arelion's Journal^^^Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch wants you to lure Viera Sunwhisper away from the settlement and then use Carinda's Scroll of Retribution on her.^With all the important matters at hand Arelion still found time in his schedule to see a mistress! It's all becoming perfectly clear. Viera Sunwhisper, that filthy wench... we'll show her to never cross a magistrix again. Take this scroll and find Viera. Find a way to lure her away from town and use the scroll on her. Arelion mentioned she couldn't resist a particular wine harvested by the cenarion druids. You might find some at Cenarion Refuge, just inside Zangarmarsh, west of here.An Alternative Alternative^8^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Daedal^Daedal^^Medicinal Purpose^The Prophecy of Velen^Daedal at Azure Watch wants you to bring him 5 Azure Snapdragon Bulbs.^The girl is too far gone for mere ointments to be effective. There may be another way... The forest of Azuremyst holds many secrets, one of those being a rare plant known as the azure snapdragon that some claim to be a panacea - a cure all. You can identify the plant by its stark contrast to the other plants of Azuremyst and its need to grow at the base of the azure pine trees. Make haste! And <name>, be wary of the root threshers of the region as they consume snapdragon for sustenance.The Mark of the Lightbringer^58^All^Western Plaguelands^Anchorite Truuen^Anchorite Truuen^The Mark of the Lightbringer^^^Obtain the Mark of the Lightbringer and return it to Anchorite Truuen at Chillwind Camp in the Western Plaguelands.^In the short time that I have been on Azeroth I have studied many of its heroes. Of them all, Uther Lightbringer stands above the rest. A hero for the ages, in the end Uther was betrayed by his most promising pupil, Arthas. In his honor, I would like to return something he lost to his nearby tomb. It is rumored that the Scarlet Crusade is keeping one of his holy relics atop their guard tower near the gates of Hearthglen. Please, <class>, go and retrieve it.Reclaiming the Eggs^46^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Featherbeard's Remains^Ambassador Rualeth^Featherbeard's Endorsement^^^Gather 5 Gryphon Eggs and return them to Ambassador Rualeth at Aerie Peak.^Looking over the remains, you surmise that this broken and battered skeleton must be all that is left of Featherbeard. Clutched in one skeletal hand is a torn and stained sheaf of paper. You gently remove and unroll it, revealing a hand-drawn map and a few hastily scrawled notes. The map appears to be a rendering of Shadra'Alor and its three temples with 'x' marks in several places, presumably the locations of the stolen eggs. You place the map in your pack for inspection at a safer location.In Pursuit of Featherbeard^46^Alliance^The Hinterlands^Featherbeard's Journal^Featherbeard's Remains^Featherbeard's Endorsement^^^Travel to Shadra'Alor and search for traces of Featherbeard.^The journal's most recent entries detail Featherbeard's concern about a growing number of Witherbark troll raids on the Wildhammer gryphon aeries and a rash of egg thefts. A search of the smaller Witherbark settlements in the area appears to have yielded no information. The last entry describes Featherbeard's suspicion that a Witherbark witch doctor named Mai'jin is behind the raids. The last, hastily written sentence states the dwarf's intention to travel to Shadra'Alor in search of the eggs.Taming the Beast^10^Blood Elf^Hunter^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Seek the Farstriders^^^Use the Taming Rod to tame a Crazed Dragonhawk, and then return to Lieutenant Dawnrunner.^You have undoubtedly hunted and slain beasts for both your defense and sustenance, yet to befriend them and harness their strengths is only now within your grasp. This I can teach you. Take this magical taming rod that allows a wild animal to temporarily bond and fight beside you. Begin with the crazed dragonhawk, a nearly docile bird found just outside of Farstrider Retreat. Return to me when this is done.Taming the Beast^10^Blood Elf^Hunter^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Seek the Farstriders^^^Use the Taming Rod to tame a Mistbat, and then return to Lieutenant Dawnrunner.^You have done well, <name>. Your understanding of the wild grows quickly. The mistbat is a clever hunter, combining the swiftness of the dragonhawk and the ferocity of the springpaw. Mistbats are found just across the Elrendar River to the south, preying on hapless travelers who wander into the Ghostlands. Use this final taming rod to befriend a mistbat and return to me when you have finished.Taming the Beast^10^Blood Elf^Hunter^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Seek the Farstriders^^^Use the Taming Rod to tame an Elder Springpaw, then return to Lieutenant Dawnrunner.^The elder springpaw is an efficient and swift hunter. In attempting to befriend one, it sees you as prey. Do not be dissuaded. Use the taming rod to bring the great cat to your side and hunt beside it. They are found throughout Eversong Woods, some very close to the lodge. When you have learned enough, return to me.Arcane Reavers^16^All^Mage^Arcanist Vandril^Arcanist Vandril^Arcane Reavers^^^Arcanist Vandril wants you to collect 10 Arcane Fragments for him.^Arcane reavers are magical creations of brute strength. They are heavily armored and deliver stunning blows. You, however, can bypass their defenses and avoid their attacks. Your spellcraft is not without many advantages, <name>. Travel to Dawnstar Spire and blast apart the arcane reavers. From their remains, collect the crystallized fragments of magical energy and return to me. Dawnstar Spire is found to the east, across the lake.A Simple Robe^16^Horde^Mage^Arcanist Vandril^Arcanist Vandril^Arcane Reavers^^^Arcanist Vandril wants you to bring him 15 Linen Cloth and a Spindleweb Silk Gland.^The arcane fragments you collected will do nicely. Nicely for what, you ask? For making a splendid robe fit for a <class> like yourself! All we need now is some linen cloth and a spindleweb silk gland. You can find the silk gland from any spindleweb spider, preferably after killing them.Cleansing the Scar^5^Horde^Priest^Ponaris^Ponaris^^^Garments of Spirituality^Cast Power Word: Fortitude on 6 Eversong Rangers in the Dead Scar.^<name>, it is good you are here. The Scourge attack our city with such endless hate that I fear the morale of our guard is breaking. Hurry to the Dead Scar just south of the city where Jaela and her rangers stand ready. Fill them with the power of the Light through your blessings.The Rock Flayer Matriarch^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Ikan^Ikan^^^^Obtain Blacktalon's Claws from Blacktalon the Savage at the Great Fissure and bring it to Ikan at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula.^Rock flayers are mean, nasty, violent creatures. But the plain ones are like tame beasts when compared to their matriarch, Blacktalon the Savage. My cousin got eaten by her and it wasn't pretty. I swore that one day Blacktalon would pay for that. You bring back proof of that monster's death and I will give you my life's savings. Deal? You're going to need some friends to kill Blacktalon. Big tough friends with sharp swords. You'll find her inside a cave in the Great Fissure. Good luck!Greed^18^Horde^Rogue^Eralan^Eralan^A Discreet Inquiry^^^Eralan in Tranquillien wants you to retrieve the Pitted Gold Band from the Amani Catacombs.^A rich, and I mean filthy rich, merchant came through here yesterday talking about some ring of "immense archeological importance" locked in one of the countless burial chests found in the Amani Catacombs. When he wasn't talking about the ring, he was talking about how much he'd pay for it. Tell you what, I'll front the thieves' tools, and if you manage to bring the ring back, I'll pay you enough to buy ten rings of your own!Turning the Tide^70^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^^^^Bring Warchief Kargath's Fist to Force Commander Danath Trollbane in Honor Hold.^The permanence of the orcish threat is one of the sad truths of Outland. There was a time when we Sons of Lothar believed we'd purchased Honor Hold's safety with our blood, but there was to be no peace. The Sons will yield to no orc - green, brown, and now red - we will overcome them or die trying. If we are to have any expectation of victory, we must take the fight to them in Hellfire Citadel. Bring me the weapon of their self-styled 'Warchief' Kargath Bladefist and you will be well rewarded.Pride of the Fel Horde^70^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Field Commander Romus^Field Commander Romus^^^^Field Commander Romus at Honor Hold wants you to kill 8 Shattered Hand Legionnaires, 4 Shattered Hand Centurions, and 4 Shattered Hand Champions.^We know precious little about the Fel Horde presence in Hellfire Citadel and our information has come at the cost of many lives. Fel Horde troops under the command of Kargath Bladefist are a brutal, battle-hardened lot fortified by foul magics. The elite of this force, the Shattered Hand legionnaires, champions, and centurions are feared by the regulars and serve as an officer corps. Targeting and eliminating them is a necessary first step in any successful assault on the Fel Horde's leadership.Fel Embers^70^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Magus Zabraxis^Magus Zabraxis^^^^Magus Zabraxis at Honor Hold wants you to bring her a Fel Ember.^The stuffy academics of Azeroth have cowered in their towers for too long and it's fallen to me to show them what cutting edge research is! They're afraid to play with fire and that's exactly what I intend to do, once I get my hands on the fire, that is. Within Hellfire Citadel's Shattered Halls, Grand Warlock Nethekurse performs unrivaled magical feats augmented by the powers of a pair of strange braziers. Using the vessel he uses to contain these fel embers, capture one and bring it back to me, <name>.The Will of the Warchief^70^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Nazgrel^^^^Bring Warchief Kargath's Fist to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.^The struggle to free the orcish people from our tainted blood has not been easy, <name>. Warchief Thrall has seen too many orcish heroes laid low by fate's hand. Now, it seems Kargath Bladefist numbers among them. In the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel, Kargath has claimed the title of 'Warchief' of the Fel Horde. With an army of crazed, bloodthirsty fel orcs at his back, he won't rest until Thrallmar is destroyed. Warchief Thrall has commanded us to defeat Kargath and his forces at all costs.Pride of the Fel Horde^70^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Shadow Hunter Ty'jin^Shadow Hunter Ty'jin^^^^Shadow Hunter Ty'jin at Thrallmar wants you to kill 8 Shattered Hand Legionnaires, 4 Shattered Hand Centurions, and 4 Shattered Hand Champions.^Overlord Maimfist's insults aside, <name>, this Fel Horde is nothing to be trifled with. From what we know, Fel Horde troops under the command of Kargath Bladefist are a brutal, battle-hardened lot fortified by foul magics. The elite of this force, the Shattered Hand legionnaires, champions, and centurions are feared by the Fel Horde regulars and serve as an officer corps. Targeting and eliminating them is a necessary first step in any successful assault on the Fel Horde's leadership.Falcon Watch^62^Orc, Undead,^Hellfire Peninsula^Martik Tor'seldori^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Falcon Watch^^^Report to Ranger Captain Venn'ren at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.^My people recently finished building Falcon Watch, a base of operations in the southwestern region of Hellfire Peninsula - beyond Hellfire Citadel. You are welcome there as an ally, <name>. If you're looking for work, go there and tell Ranger Captain Venn'ren that I sent you. He will see to it that you're given tasks worthy of someone of your caliber.Falcon Watch^62^Blood Elf^Hellfire Peninsula^Martik Tor'seldori^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Falcon Watch^^^Travel to Falcon Watch in the southwest of Hellfire Peninsula and report to Ranger Captain Venn'ren.^What are you still doing here, <name>? Didn't you hear we built a proper sin'dorei outpost here in Hellfire Peninsula? Surely you'd rather be among fellow blood elves and away from all this... smell. You'll find Falcon Watch in the southwest, beyond Hellfire Citadel. Report to Ranger Captain Venn'ren; he will take care of you. The road ahead is dangerous and heavily patrolled by Alliance scouts. I would recommend travelling with companions. Blood elves, preferably.Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Sulaa^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Water^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^It's been a while since last you were tested. Farseer Nobundo has been asking for you. You must have grown greatly in wisdom because you are being called to learn the mysteries of the element of water. You remember where to find him at the Crystal Hall inside of the Exodar, right?Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Farseer Nobundo^Aqueous^Call of Water^^^Speak with Aqueous in the Hidden Reef at Bloodmyst Isle.^A powerful water elemental named Aqueous has requested your presence. It would seem that there is a great imbalance occurring in the water element on Bloodmyst Isle. Not surprising given the unnatural predilections of the blood elves. You will find Aqueous in a hidden reef under the waves off the northern shore of Bloodmyst Isle. Take this potion; it can help you to get to her once you get into the water near the reef.Call of Water^20^All^Shaman^Farseer Javad^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Water^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^It's been a while since last you were tested. Farseer Nobundo has been asking for you. You must have grown greatly in wisdom because you are being called to learn the mysteries of the element of water. You remember where to find him at the Crystal Hall inside of the Exodar, right?Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Aqueous^Aqueous^Call of Water^^^Collect 6 Foul Essences and return them to Aqueous in the Hidden Reef at Bloodmyst Isle.^In balance with the other elements, water is the source and sustenance of all living things. It gives and nurtures life, and all rely upon it for their existence. Yet, when polluted, it also brings life to an end. We must determine the extent of the damage that has been done. To the southwest is one such contaminated body of water that has come to be known as the Foul Pool. Travel there and extract the foul essence from the water spirits that inhabit the pool.Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Aqueous^Aqueous^Call of Water^^^Fill the Empty Bota Bag and then return to Aqueous in the Hidden Reef at Bloodmyst Isle.^It is worse than I feared. The corruption is very potent and if unchecked it could spread to the ocean currents and be carried throughout all of Azeroth! We are going to need a sample of the purest water to counter this malignancy. There are ruins on the untainted portion of this island, to the southeast. Go there, where the Wrathscale naga reside, and take from their fountain. Use this bota bag to gather the sample. Hurry, <name>!The Prophecy of Velen^8^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Daedal^Admiral Odesyus^The Prophecy of Velen^An Alternative Alternative^^Daedal wants you to travel south and seek out the people that the injured creature mentioned.^The Prophet spoke of this day: That on this island, in this new world, our allies would find us. "We will be tested. They will ask that we pay for the sins of our fathers..." At the time, I did not understand the meaning behind his words, but seeing this creature and her reaction to us, it is now coming into focus. The corruption of our people has been felt even here. Venture south. It is there that we found this being. Find its kin and tell them of our people.A Small Start^7^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Admiral Odesyus^Admiral Odesyus^The Prophecy of Velen^^^Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing wants you to recover the Nautical Compass and Nautical Map stolen by the Venture Co.^I am Admiral Odesyus of Alliance Naval Command. Our ship was forced to port on your island due to an infestation of sorts. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but goblins somehow managed to stow away in the holds of both of my ships. Last night, while most of the ship's crew was asleep below deck, they struck! Stranger still, they took our navigation gear and jumped ship! They disappeared into the thicket, east of here. Will you go in search of our gear? It will make for a strong gesture.Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Aqueous^Aqueous^Call of Water^^^Bring the Head of Tel'athion to Aqueous in the Hidden Reef at Bloodmyst Isle.^I have determined where the corruption is coming from. It is the by-product of some demented research and you're going to put an end to it! Just to the southwest of the Foul Pool is a small camp. There you will find the 'research' of Tel'athion the Impure. This is where he produces the filth that has been seeping into the island's water. Use the pure water you obtained from Ashenvale to destroy his cache of barrels. That will be sure to bring him out. We will have an end to this!Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Aqueous^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Water^^^Take the Flask of Purest Water to Farseer Nobundo inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^I held back a little of the water from Ashenvale, not because I doubted your ability to deal with the situation. Rather, I knew that you would succeed, and I wanted to make sure that you had something special to take back to Nobundo. Here, <name>, take this flask of pure water. It will ensure that you receive a very powerful water totem. Farseer Nobundo awaits your return at the Exodar.Cookie's Jumbo Gumbo^7^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^"Cookie" McWeaksauce^"Cookie" McWeaksauce^^^^"Cookie" McWeaksauce at the Odesyus' Landing wants you to bring him 6 Skittering Crawler Meat.^The Admiral be right, ye are a resourceful one. Mayhap ye could help Cookie out? If I serve the crew chicken for dinner again, I'll be sent to the brig fer sure. I noticed that thar be crawlers all along the coastline - lots o' crawlers! Bring me crawler meats and I'll be forever indebted to ya. Help a reformed pirate out?Reclaiming the Ruins^8^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare^^^^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill 5 Wrathscale Myrmidons, 5 Wrathscale Naga and 5 Wrathscale Sirens.^While some may look at our current predicament as an unfortunate turn of events, I sense that we are here for a reason. The invisible hand of fate has pushed us in this direction. The reason why will become evident in time. To the west lies an ancient night elf city, now in ruin and overrun with naga. It would be remiss of me to sit idly by as the naga tainted my ancestral lands. You have shown yourself a capable <class>. Honor my people and cleanse the ruins of their unwelcome inhabitants.Rune Covered Tablet^8^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Rune Covered Tablet^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare^^^Warlord Sriss'tiz^Take the Rune Covered Tablet to Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle.^You cannot make out any of the symbols on the tablet. Perhaps the priestess would be able to decipher the mysterious runes.Warlord Sriss'tiz^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare^^Rune Covered Tablet^^Priestess Kyleen Il'dinare at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill Warlord Sriss'tiz.^A naga invasion would be disastrous, <name>. I've seen what naga can do and I would not want to see such a catastrophe befall any being. If I were to guess, this Warlord Sriss'tiz will be hidden in a cave - probably along the coast to the west. Find Warlord Sriss'tiz and put an end to his reign.Destroy the Legion^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Vindicator Vedaar^Vindicator Vedaar^^^^Slay 6 Mannoroc Lashers, 6 Felguards and 6 Searing Infernals, and then return to Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song in Ashenvale.^I will not tolerate their existence on this world! The Burning Legion all but destroyed our race and we fell back to settle a new home on a new world. Then they came again. And we retreated, over and over. No more! There is a remnant of the Legion to the south in the regions known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge. They are what is leftover from a force that once long ago invaded this world. Go and destroy as many as you can before it is too late!A Shameful Waste^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Architect Nemos^Gnarl^^^^Bring 15 pieces of Warsong Lumber and 5 Satyrnaar Fel Wood to Gnarl at Forest Song.^Welcome to Forest Song, <class>. Where you see tents, there will one day be buildings, but such ambitions require a steady stream of building materials. I cannot bring myself to order our workers to fell any of the ancient trees of this grove, but our neighbors to the south and west have no such reverence for the forest. We shall relieve the Warsong loggers of their excess, and reclaim some of the tainted wood from the satyr stronghold to the west. Bring the wood to Gnarl, who will purify it for our use.Agents of Destruction^28^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper^Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper^^^^Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper at Forest Song wants you to kill Overseer Gorthak, 2 Warsong Shredders, 5 Horde Deforesters, and 10 Horde Scouts.^The Warsong Lumber Camp is a blight upon an embattled landscape. Every time we make progress in halting their operations, Overseer Gorthak orders his loggers to redouble their efforts! Now, the orcs are cutting more wood than they can possibly use, leaving it to rot while their blades bite into fresh trees! This is an affront to all we stand for, <name>, and we will show them that we'll not suffer further destruction of our lands! Go, and do not rest until Overseer Gorthak and his minions are dead!The Lost Chalice^27^Alliance^Ashenvale^Kayneth Stillwind^Kayneth Stillwind^^^^Bring the Chalice of Elune to Kayneth Stillwind at Forest Song.^The area to our west, now called Satyrnaar, was once a prominent shrine built by my people. It housed a priceless relic, the Chalice of Elune, entrusted to the shrine's keepers by the priests of Elune. Pilgrims once traveled to the shrine to experience the healing powers the chalice was rumored to hold. These stories might be nothing but old wives' tales, but if there is any truth to them, the relic may hold the key to rejuvenating the wounded forest. I must know, <name>.Diabolical Plans^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Diabolical Plans^Vindicator Vedaar^Diabolical Plans^^^Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song in Ashenvale.^The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Common tongue! The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Forest Song to the north; the location where a new draenei settlement is being established. Perhaps Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song would be interested in these?Report from the Northern Front^25^Alliance^Ashenvale^Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper^Sentinel Farsong^^^^Deliver Sentinel Luciel's report to Sentinel Farsong at Silverwing Grove.^The battle against the Warsong Lumber Camp isn't being waged from Forest Song alone, <name>. There's a more substantial Silverwing Sentinel presence at Silverwing Grove to the southwest, near the border with the Barrens. From the grove, Sentinel Farsong directs our efforts against those who would destroy our lands. I'm a bit late in sending my latest report to Sentinel Farsong, but also hesitant to leave Forest Song unattended. If your travels take you near Silverwing Grove, would you deliver my report?Never Again!^32^Alliance^Ashenvale^Vindicator Vedaar^Vindicator Vedaar^Diabolical Plans^^^Kill Gorgannon and Diathorus the Seeker, and then return to Vindicator Vedaar at Forest Song in Ashenvale.^<name>, it falls to you to see that this attack by the Burning Legion never comes to pass. You must go and slay their leaders. Without them the rest of the demons are essentially mindless. You will find Gorgannon in Demon Fall Canyon south beyond Felfire Hill, near Mannoroth's floating, broken spear. Diathorus the Seeker resides somewhere in the barrow den atop Demon Fall Ridge. To find the ridge, look for a ramp up from Demon Fall Canyon near the Horde's monument to Grom Hellscream.Precious and Fragile Things Need Special Handling^8^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart^Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart^^^^Archaeologist Adamant Ironheart at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him 8 Ancient Relics.^The priestess tells me that the ruins to the west are what's left of a night elf civilization. That got me thinking about what my pappy used to always say about night elf ruins, "Sonny, whenever you see night elf ruins, night elf relics are sure to be close by." Now what kind of a dwarf would I be if I didn't hire the first person I saw to go digging up night elf relics for me? Now get going!Imprisoned in the Citadel^70^All^Honor Hold^Randy Whizzlesprocket^Captain Alina^^^^Rescue Captain Alina inside Hellfire Citadel before she is executed.^Alliance, here?! Listen carefully, <class>. Kargath has captured several of our soldiers. Captain Alina, an important officer is among them. You must try to save her before she is executed. Don't worry about me, I'll find a way out as soon as I catch my breath.Imprisoned in the Citadel^70^All^Thrallmar^Drisella^Captain Boneshatter^^^^Rescue Captain Boneshatter inside Hellfire Citadel before he is executed.^I was fortunate to escape Kargath's prison today, <name>. Several prisoners are scheduled to be executed, an important officer among them. It would be a huge blow against our forces if Captain Boneshatter was slain. You must do what you can to rescue him. I'm too weak to go on...Reclaiming Felfire Hill^30^Alliance^Ashenvale^Gnarl^Gnarl^^^^Plant 8 Tree Seedlings in the Fertile Dirt Mounds and then return to Gnarl at Forest Song in Ashenvale.^Little one, to the south is an area of Nightsong Woods that has in recent times come to be called Felfire Hill. It is very sad to see the demons crawling over it, spreading their corruption. Would you do something to help take back the land? I have a number of seeds that I have been saving for such a purpose. Take them to Felfire Hill and plant them in the fertile dirt mounds.All That Remains^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Cowlen^Cowlen^The Missing Fisherman^^^Cowlen on Azuremyst Isle wants you to recover the Remains of Cowlen's Family.^We had lived peacefully among the Owlbeasts of this island for many years. You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us. I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer. When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood. They were devoured whole. I care not for vengeance, <name>. I only ask that their remains be returned to me for proper burial.A Cry For Help^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Magwin^Cowlen^^^^Escort Magwin through the island to her home.^My family was attacked by the murlocs and owlkin of this island several weeks ago. I managed to escape but I think that both my mother and father have been slain. I don't know what I'm going to do now, but I must try and get back to my home - or what's left of it... Will you help me get through the forest?The Stone^10^Blood Elf^Warlock^Talionia^Voidstone^Return to Talionia^^^Obtain a Voidstone from the Dead Scar.^While I'm certain your imp has proven a useful and sometimes entertaining servant, it is time you mastered a more powerful demon: the voidwalker. Travel down the Dead Scar until it is crossed by the Elrendar River. Just south of the river, locate one of the blue glowing stones and take it. Your path will be revealed there.I've Got a Plant^9^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Admiral Odesyus^Admiral Odesyus^The Prophecy of Velen^^^Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him a Hollowed Out Tree and 5 Piles of Leaves.^I've wondered about this for some time now, but this proves it to be true. There is a traitor among us. The plans left behind by the goblins document the conspiracy. Since I don't know who it could be, I'm going to need your help in finding the traitor. None of my crew can be trusted. If this is going to work, I'm going to need a hollowed out tree and leaves. Search near the loggers north of us for the tree. You'll need to find the leaves by yourself. Check the forest.Tree's Company^9^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Admiral Odesyus^Admiral Odesyus^The Prophecy of Velen^^^Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing on Azuremyst Isle wants you to observe the meeting that is to take place between Geezle and the traitor.^According to the plans, the traitor and the leader of the goblins, Geezle, are to meet at a cove on the western island. I need you to be at that meeting, <name>. Remember the tree and leaves? You're going to wear them! It's a perfect disguise. Go to the cove and look for a naga flag. If the flag is there, it means a meeting is planned. Use the disguise kit when you see the flag and wait. Eventually the traitor will show up. Let the meeting finish then return to me with the identity of the scoundrel.Find Keltus Darkleaf^10^Horde^Rogue^Zelanis^Keltus Darkleaf^Find Keltus Darkleaf^^The Shattered Hand^Locate Keltus Darkleaf.^<name>, one of our scouts has taken too strong an interest in his duties. He surveys our enemies relentlessly, but sends no reports of his findings. You must find this spy, Keltus Darkleaf, convince him to hand over his report and return it to me as swiftly as possible. He can be found far to the southwest, where the Elrendar River forks and flows around Goldenmist Village. The night elves of An'daroth are his quarry, and he won't be far from them.A Helping Hand^25^Alliance^Ashenvale^Vindicator Palanaar^Architect Nemos^^^^Make your way to Forest Song and speak with Architect Nemos.^My people have undertaken an important endeavor in the eastern part of Ashenvale, with support and cooperation from the kaldorei. Under the supervision of Architect Nemos and Vindicator Vedaar, they are revitalizing an old night elf outpost. The task of building won't be easy, <name>, for the challenges and enemies they face are many. I know Architect Nemos and his compatriots at Forest Song would appreciate any help they can get, and he has asked me to send any interested <men/women> his way.Destroy the Legion^30^Horde^Ashenvale^Valusha^Valusha^^^^Slay 6 Mannoroc Lashers, 6 Felguards and 6 Searing Infernals, and then return to Valusha at Splintertree Post in Ashenvale.^The remains of the demonic Burning Legion have been making raids against our Warsong Lumber Camp! No more! The demons are attacking from the areas known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge to the east. Go and destroy as many as you can to bring glory to both yourself and the Horde!Diabolical Plans^30^Horde^Ashenvale^Diabolical Plans^Valusha^Diabolical Plans^^^Deliver the Diabolical Plans to Valusha at Splintertree Post in Ashenvale.^The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Orcish tongue! The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts. The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Splintertree Post to the northwest. You're certain that Valusha at Splintertree Post would be interested in these.Never Again!^32^Horde^Ashenvale^Valusha^Valusha^Diabolical Plans^^^Kill Gorgannon and Diathorus the Seeker.^<name>, you will see to it that this attack by the Burning Legion never comes to pass! Go and slay these dreadlords! Without them the rest of the demons are essentially mindless. You will find Gorgannon in Demon Fall Canyon south beyond Felfire Hill, near Mannoroth's floating, broken spear. Diathorus the Seeker resides somewhere in the barrow den atop Demon Fall Ridge. To find the ridge, look for a ramp up from Demon Fall Canyon near the monument to Grom Hellscream.Show Gnomercy^9^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Admiral Odesyus^Admiral Odesyus^The Prophecy of Velen^^^Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing wants you to recover the Traitor's Communication from Engineer "Spark" Overgrind.^Spark must be brought to justice! I need you to go down to the beach and find that deceitful gnome. Once you find him, get whatever information you can out of him! If a high ranking official of the Alliance has committed treasonous acts, who knows how many others are corrupt? And <name>, use force if you have to...Learning the Language^8^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Cryptographer Aurren^Totem of Akida^Learning the Language^^Saving Princess Stillpine^Read the Stillpine Furbolg Language Primer that Aurren gave you and interact with the Totem of Akida at Azure Watch.^I think I've cracked it, <name>! <Aurren points to the totem.> All that we need to know about the Stillpine furbolg language is imprinted on their totems. With just a rudimentary understanding of how their symbols work, we can study the totems and learn to communicate with the furbolgs. I've written down the basics of the symbol matrix on this parchment. Study it and then examine the totem. It should lead you to the next language totem. Speak to Arugoo when you return an educated <race>!Totem of Coo^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Totem of Akida^Totem of Coo^Learning the Language^^^Find the Totem of Coo using the clues provided to you.^You begin to read the totem, barely able to pronounce the awkward words and phrases. Slowly, words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go up the nearby hill, to the northeast.Totem of Tikti^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Totem of Coo^Totem of Tikti^Learning the Language^^^Find the Totem of Tikti using the clues provided to you.^You begin to read the totem, better able to pronounce the words and phrases. Words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go across the Crystalbrook river to the east. Perhaps your destination is on the other side of the river.Totem of Yor^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Totem of Tikti^Totem of Yor^Learning the Language^^^Find the Totem of Yor using the clues provided to you.^The symbols on this totem seem to translate much faster. The patterns and imagery all seem to blend into familiar words. You are fairly certain the totem is pointing you south, down the river. Something is at the bottom of the river itself.Totem of Vark^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Totem of Yor^Totem of Vark^Learning the Language^^^Find the Totem of Vark using the clues provided to you.^You no longer see unrecognizable symbology in the totems. The totem of Yor reads to you just as easily as your native tongue. The markings identify another furbolg den, due west of here. You are able to expertly decipher the language on the totem and know that your destination is Bristlelimb Village. Yor will guide you but if you get lost, you know that you are able to take the ancient elven road in the forest leading west to reach your destination.Atonement^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Anchorite Obadei^Amaan the Wise^Atonement^Makuru's Vengeance^^Speak to Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula.^Our history with the orcs is one of constant conflict, <name>. We were once near driven to extinction due to their bloodlust and have since then avoided them even when not under demonic influence. Yet, this retaliation... it's not what Sedai would've wanted. Speak with our elder, Amaan the Wise. He will help shed light on these events.The Prophecy of Akida^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Totem of Vark^Arugoo of the Stillpine^Learning the Language^^Stillpine Hold^Free 8 Stillpine Captives from cages found in Bristlelimb Village. Return to Arugoo of the Stillpine at Azure Watch when you have completed this task.^The images on this totem depict a war between the Stillpine and the Bristlelimb furbolg tribes. The etchings show that the Bristlelimb have done unconscionable things to the furbolgs of Stillpine. Amidst the chaos, a prophecy has begun to unfold: A hero will rise - not of furbolg blood - and save the Stillpine tribe. Slay Bristlelimb furbolgs at Bristlelimb Village for their keys. Use the keys to free the Stillpine captives. Return to Arugoo of the Stillpine when you have freed them all!The Seer's Relic^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Amaan the Wise^Amaan the Wise^Atonement^^^Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to return to Sedai's Corpse, northeast of the Temple of Telhamat, and use the Seer's Relic at that location. Return to him after you've completed this task.^The stubborn close their mind and convince themselves of one truth. The wise keep an open mind to the different possibilities leading to and stemming from the present. Take this relic with you to where you found Sedai. See not with your eyes, <name>, but with your mind.Call of Air^30^Draenei^Shaman^Farseer Javad^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Air^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^<name>, Farseer Nobundo has been asking for you. It must be time for you to learn the secrets of air, the last of the elements! I want you to know that I'm very proud of all that you have accomplished thus far. I know that you have great things ahead of you.Pilfered Equipment^17^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Clopper Wizbang^Clopper Wizbang^^^Artifacts of the Blacksilt^Bring Clopper's Equipment back to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell.^Shh! Keep your voice down and don't call attention to me. If the murlocs detect my presence, the experiment will be ruined! I've already come perilously close to contaminating my data. While I was foraging yesterday, one of them must've wandered too close and discovered my camp. I returned just in time to see two of them carrying off a crate with most of my equipment! It's bound to be in one of their settlements around here, but I can't risk revealing my presence. Are you willing to help?Artifacts of the Blacksilt^17^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Clopper Wizbang^Clopper Wizbang^^Pilfered Equipment^A Map to Where?^Bring 3 Crude Murloc Idols and 6 Crude Murloc Knives to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell.^My observations and writings about the Blacksilt murlocs are quite illuminating, <name>, but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to Ironforge with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills. The problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my conscience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them.A Map to Where?^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Weathered Treasure Map^Battered Ancient Book^A Map to Where?^Artifacts of the Blacksilt^^Locate the pavilion described by the map and search for what the map's maker was trying to record.^The crudely-drawn map reveals nothing of its maker, but it appears to have been drawn with an unsteady hand. Wavering lines and symbols depict a small pavilion with broken columns located to the west of a partially submerged tower. If the map is to be believed, this cluster of ruins appears to be located on the eastern coast of the island. You have no idea what you'll find, but it was important enough for the map's creator to record.Call of Air^30^Draenei^Shaman^Sulaa^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Air^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^<name>, Farseer Nobundo has been asking for you. It must be time for you to learn the secrets of air, the last of the elements! I want you to know that I'm very proud of all that you have accomplished thus far. I know that you have great things ahead of you.Call of Air^30^Draenei^Shaman^Farseer Nobundo^Velaada^Call of Air^^^Speak with Velaada at Wildwind Peak on Azuremyst Isle.^The great spirit of air calls out to you, <name>, and it is time for you to take heed. I wish for you to travel up the Wildwind Path on the north facing of the mountain that the Exodar has crashed into. At its peak you will find a cave and within will be one of my most accomplished pupils, Velaada. Please, listen to her wisdom and do as she bids. When you return you will have a greater understanding of the element of air.Call of Air^30^Draenei^Shaman^Velaada^Susurrus^Call of Air^^^Speak with Susurrus at Wildwind Peak on Azuremyst Isle.^While air may seem ethereal, it is an all pervasive force, covering and permeating everything around us. Though you cannot see it, the rocks of this cave are composed mostly of air, the waters of the oceans are saturated in it and without it, fire cannot be sustained. Just don't let those elements hear you repeat that! Who you really wish to speak with for such wisdom is nearby. At the northern edge of the precipice, Susurrus awaits you. It is from him that you will gain understanding.Call of Air^30^Draenei^Shaman^Susurrus^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Air^^^Return to Farseer Nobundo at the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle with the Whorl of Air.^While my brothers and sisters of the other elements have demanded that you perform various tasks, I will not ask anything further of you. I think that you have done enough to 'atone' for the accident of your ship falling to this place from my skies. I can see that you have all the wisdom within you already to use the element of air wisely. Take this portion of my being back to Farseer Nobundo so that he might help you fashion your totem. And when you're ready, I will fly you back down to the Exodar.Call of Fire^10^Alliance^Shaman^Prophet Velen^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Fire^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall in the Exodar.^I am thankful that you have chosen the difficult path of the shaman. Few enough do, but I foresee it as critical to our future that we learn shamanism from the Broken. They are called that, but once they were draenei. Fel magics transformed them, and that is why they cannot call upon the power of the Light. Some disapprove of them and the shamanism they teach, but they are not evil. I wish you to speak with Farseer Nobundo. He is the wisest shaman I know and you will learn much with his guidance.Deciphering the Book^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Battered Ancient Book^Anchorite Paetheus^A Map to Where?^^Nolkai's Words^Take the Ancient Journal to Anchorite Paetheus in Blood Watch.^Lacking the means to read the book's contents, you think about who might be able to help you separate the author's words from the mapmaker's scrawl. Remembering Anchorite Paetheus's collection of artifacts from countless cultures, you wonder if his experienced eye might be able to help you decipher the book's contents.The Longbeards^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Sid Limbardi^Gremni Longbeard^The Longbeards^Expedition Point^^Look for Gremni Longbeard northwest of the Den of Haal'esh, to the far west of Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^We were having a problem with arakkoa bandits raiding many of our supply caravans, so I hired some dwarves to take care of them. They were brothers; Gremni Longbeard was the oldest. I'm a little worried about them. Those crazy dwarves packed more ale than food or ammunition! Maybe you can go check up on them? The arakkoa's hideout, the Den of Haal'esh, can be found to the far west of here - beyond the Great Fissure. They set up camp northwest of there, south of Dustquill Ravine.Stillpine Hold^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Arugoo of the Stillpine^High Chief Stillpine^Fulfilling a Promise^The Prophecy of Akida^Beasts of the Apocalypse!, Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now?, Search Stillpine Hold^Speak with High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold.^Promised one, you must travel north to the home of my people - Stillpine Hold. It is there that you will face your most daunting challenge. Go now, High Chief Stillpine awaits your arrival.Beasts of the Apocalypse!^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Moordo^Moordo^^Stillpine Hold^Search Stillpine Hold^Moordo at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to bring him 8 Ravager Hides.^My brother and I were hunting in the woods to the east when we were ambushed by strange, insect-like beasts. Such aberrations have never before been seen in Azuremyst! Could they be a sign of the coming apocalypse? The apocalypse that YOU are destined to prevent? If you truly are the Promised One, you will strike the creatures of the apocalypse down... and bring me their hides. From their hides, I can fashion armor of great power! Find them to the east, beyond the road.Nolkai's Words^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Anchorite Paetheus^Mound of Dirt^^Deciphering the Book^^Find the location described in Nolkai's journal and discover his long-buried possessions.^The translation is ready now, <name>. <Anchorite Paetheus points out a block of text at the end of his translation.> 'The enemy is nearly upon us. We've gathered up all the survivors and retreated to the temple to the east. It's the last ground we truly hold on the island, and there is a sense among the survivors that we will make our last stand here. I've taken care to bury my last few possessions on the grounds of the temple, with the hope that someone will find them and know what happened here.'Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now?^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Gurf^Gurf^^Stillpine Hold^Gurf's Dignity, Chieftain Oomooroo^Gurf at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to recover 5 sacks of Stillpine Grain.^These are dark days, Promised One. Even the murlocs are kicking our tails - literally. Unfortunately, more than just my ego has been bruised. While our relationship with the Siltfin murlocs had always been tenuous, never could we have imagined that they would have the gall to attack us and steal from our food stores! Travel west to the Silting Shore and recover our stolen food-stuffs! And if you see a dark-skinned murloc with a patch of white fur stuck in between his webbed toes...Gaining Mirren's Trust^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Mirren Longbeard^Mirren Longbeard^Gaining Mirren's Trust^^^Mirren Longbeard wants you to bring him 1 Nethergarde Bitter. You must also attain Friendly reputation with Honor Hold to complete this quest.^So you want to gain our trust? I don't trust many people these days. We lost one of our own not long ago to the arakkoa. It's got me a bit on edge. Tell you what, if you can prove your loyalty to Honor Hold and... bring me a mug of Nethergarde Bitter... yes, that sounds rather good about now... I'll have a deal to offer you then. Bernie at Nethergarde Keep keeps the bitter in stock.Gurf's Dignity^11^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Gurf's Dignity^Gurf^^Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now?^^Return Gurf's Dignity to Gurf at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle.^You recover the piece of fur that Gurf had "lost" in his struggle with the murlocs. Return the fur to Gurf and let him know that the fearsome Murgurgula has been slain.Search Stillpine Hold^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^High Chief Stillpine^Blood Crystal^Search Stillpine Hold^Stillpine Hold^The Kurken is Lurkin'^Search Stillpine Hold for clues.^As High Chief, my immediate concern is the root of the corruption in Stillpine Hold. Why did the wildkin - once our allies - attack us? Why have they taken residence in Stillpine Hold? Perhaps something inside will hold the answer. Search Stillpine Hold for clues as to the source of corruption.Blood Crystals^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Blood Crystal^High Chief Stillpine^Search Stillpine Hold^^^Speak with High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold.^On the surface, the crystal appears to be a piece of the Exodar. Something has gone terribly wrong with this crystal, however, as it is blood red and rapidly dissolving into the water supply of the cave. This may explain the unusually aggressive behavior of the creatures in Azuremyst. Return to High Chief Stillpine with this information.Know Thine Enemy^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Aalesia^Vindicator Aalesia^^^Containing the Threat^Find the Nazzivus Monument in Nazzivian and retrieve a Nazzivus Monument Glyph. Return to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch when you have one of the glyphs.^It's good to see another new face here in Blood Watch, <class>. Although the blood elves are the most immediate threat, there are other sinister creatures that call Bloodmyst Isle home. The Nazzivus satyr are of particular concern. They are foul, demonic creatures, commanding dark magics and feeding on the corruption created by the Exodar's crash. We must hold them in check, but first we must learn more about them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and learn what you can from their grotesque monument.Containing the Threat^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Aalesia^Vindicator Aalesia^On the Offensive^Know Thine Enemy^^Kill 5 Axxarien Shadowstalkers, 5 Axxarien Hellcallers, and Zevrax, then gather 5 Corrupted Crystals and return to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch.^Now that we have made our presence known to the satyr, we must send a message that we will not tolerate the Burning Legion's hounds in these lands. Too long have the draenei fled in the wake of the Legion and its minions, <name>. Wherever they have found us, they have shown no mercy. We must not permit the satyr to exploit the Exodar's crash and use the corrupted crystals as weapons. Go north to where their leader resides in Axxarien, destroy him, and recover the corrupted crystals he has been gathering!The Kurken is Lurkin'^12^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Kurz the Revelator^Kurz the Revelator^The Kurken is Lurkin'^Search Stillpine Hold^Warn Your People^Kurz the Revelator at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to kill the Kurken and bring back the Kurken's Hide.^After the crystal storm had subsided, a beast of myth appeared in our village. Brought here by the invading wildkin, this beast, the Kurken, laid waste to our village. Many Stillpine were slain in defense of our lands by this fiend and many have since lost their lives attempting to subdue the beast. In my visions, I have seen one defeat the Kurken. The one must be you, <name>. You are our only hope. Enter Stillpine Hold and slay the Kurken. Bring me his hide as proof of deed.The Kurken's Hide^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Kurz the Revelator^Moordo^The Kurken is Lurkin'^^^Deliver the Kurken's Hide to Moordo at Stillpine Hold.^Take the Kurken's hide to Moordo, on the other side of the village. He will fashion the hide into an item of your choice.Weaken the Ramparts^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Stone Guard Stok'ton^Caza'rez^Weaken the Ramparts^Forward Base: Reaver's Fall^^Slay Watchkeeper Gargolmar, Omor the Unscarred and the drake, Nazan. Return Gargolmar's Hand, Omor's Hoof and Nazan's Head to Caza'rez at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^Quick, there isn't much time. Thrallmar's existence balances on the razor's edge! We're caught between Hellfire Citadel in the west and the Burning Legion to the east. With the Legion's attention turned toward the Dark Portal we must take this opportunity to strike at the fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel. The key to this is to first break through their ramparts! Go there, slay their leaders, and then bring back proof to Caza'rez across the room from me!Chieftain Oomooroo^11^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Stillpine the Younger^Stillpine the Younger^^Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now?^^Stillpine the Younger at Stillpine Hold on Azuremyst Isle wants you to slay Chieftain Oomooroo and 9 Crazed Wildkin.^I am Stillpine the Younger, heir to the Stillpine legacy. As you can see, my defenders have set up a death trap for the raving wildkin that attack from inside Stillpine Hold. While we are able to hold them off out here, none of my defenders have been able to infiltrate the hold. If you could get inside and slay their leader, it might give us an opportunity to strike! Find Chieftain Oomooroo and destroy him. Slay any crazed wildkin that you encounter inside as well.Victims of Corruption^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Morae^Morae^Catch and Release^^^Bring 6 pieces of Crystallized Bark to Morae in Blood Watch.^Bloodmyst Isle was forever changed by our arrival. The Exodar's crash scattered debris all over the islands and I think it's beginning to have an adverse effect on the wildlife. Before I can be certain of my conclusion, I'll need to get a closer look. The crystals seem to have affected the trees the fastest, so it seems that the treants would be the most likely to show symptoms. If you bring me samples of bark from corrupted treants, I can begin my in-depth studies.Weaken the Ramparts^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Lieutenant Chadwick^Gunny^Weaken the Ramparts^Expedition Point^^Slay Watchkeeper Gargolmar, Omor the Unscarred and the drake, Nazan. Return Gargolmar's Hand, Omor's Hoof and Nazan's Head to Gunny at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^Quick, <class>, there isn't much time. Honor Hold's existence balances on the razor's edge! We're caught between Hellfire Citadel in the west and the forces of the Burning Legion to the east. With the Legion's attention turned toward the Dark Portal we must take this opportunity to strike at the fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel. The key to this is to first break through their ramparts! Go there, slay their leaders, and then bring back proof to Gunny across the hall here from me!Cruelfin's Necklace^12^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Red Crystal Pendant^Morae^^^^Bring the Red Crystal Pendant to Morae at Blood Watch.^Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness. You're not quite sure what might have possessed Cruelfin to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at Blood Watch.Searching for Galaen^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Morae^Galaen's Corpse^Searching for Galaen^^Galaen's Journal - The Fate of Vindicato^Search for Morae's husband Galaen.^Do you think often of your family, <name>? There were a number of families aboard the Exodar, but I've heard of very few being reunited. I, myself, am looking for traces of my husband Galaen, who was a technician in the Cryo-Core. The wreckage of it is located to the west, and it's swarming with blood elves! I must find out what became of Galaen! Even news of his death is better than never knowing. My husband will be wearing a pendant identical to my own; they were a gift from my sister.Galaen's Fate^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Galaen's Corpse^Morae^Searching for Galaen^^^Bring Galaen's Amulet to Morae at Blood Watch.^You have no means of identifying the corpse as Galaen with the information Morae gave you, but the clothing appears to have been torn in search of valuables. The blood elves in the area would've claimed anything of value from the wreckage, including Galaen's jeweled amulet. Although her husband did not survive the crash, you believe that Morae would be grateful if you recovered her husband's amulet from the blood elves.The Bear Necessities^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Tracker Lyceon^Tracker Lyceon^^^^Bring 8 Elder Brown Bear Flanks to Tracker Lyceon in Blood Watch.^As I'm sure you've seen in your time on Bloodmyst Isle, very little remains unchanged by our arrival. My training and experience has taught me that even the products of an environment like this one can be put to use. With so few resources, we must rely on our ingenuity to provide for us. I've been supplementing our stores with meat from the bears that wander this island. With the proper preparation, it can safely be eaten. If you're going to be out in the field, why not help replenish our stocks?Learning from the Crystals^11^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Harbinger Mikolaas^Harbinger Mikolaas^Learning from the Crystals^^^Get an Impact Site Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Impact Site Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.^Welcome to Blood Watch, <class>. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar. The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island. The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge.Strength of One^10^Alliance^Warrior^Ruada^Ruada^Strength of One^^Bartleby the Drunk^Unlock the Ravager Cage and kill the Death Ravager, then return to Ruada at Azure Watch in Azuremyst.^When the ship crashed, our menagerie was scattered on the northeast beaches of this isle. I have been handed a key that unlocks the cage holding one of the deadlier specimens, a death ravager. The creature is little armored but resistant to most magic. It must be killed by a simple blade. Take this key and release the creature from both its prison and its pain. We cannot afford to have it escape and cause even more damage to the ecology than we already have.The Second Sample^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Harbinger Mikolaas^Harbinger Mikolaas^Learning from the Crystals^^^Get an Altered Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Altered Bloodmyst Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.^Now that we have the baseline crystal, we're going to need samples from more dangerous areas of the island to complete the set I'll be sending to the Exodar. The next sample must come from the crystals controlled by the blood elves in the Bladewood area to the northwest of Blood Watch. I have heard reports that they alter and harvest the crystals for use in some magical apparatus. See if you can find one that has not yet been incorporated into one of their devices, and mine a sample from it.The Final Sample^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Harbinger Mikolaas^Harbinger Mikolaas^Learning from the Crystals^^^Get an Axxarian Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Axxarien Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.^There's just one sample remaining before I can send this set of crystals to the Exodar, <name>. The final sample must come from the satyr stronghold of Axxarien to the northwest. I'm not certain what to expect from this crystal sample, but I'm sure there will be some signs of corruption. Take care to mine your shard from the crystal that looks like the ones you took your previous samples from, or else our researchers cannot make a valid comparison.Help Tavara^5^Alliance^Priest^Guvan^Guvan^^^Garments of the Light^Guvan at Azure Watch wants you to find Tavara and heal her wounds.^Tavara, one of our herbalists, has been gone far too long in her search for herbs. I fear she is hurt and in need of help, yet I cannot look for her myself. Please find her and lend your healing if needed, fellow <class>. She was heading east towards some hot springs when she left Azure Watch.Dark Tidings^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Ominous Letter^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^^^The Blood is Life^Take the Ominous Letter to Force Commander Danath Trollbane at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^Giving the lifeless form of Vazruden the Herald the once-over, you discover a rolled letter, its seal yet unbroken. An elaborate "I" is pressed within the blood-red ink. Cracking the note open, the message that you read is most disturbing. Force Commander Danath Trollbane back at Honor Hold will definitely want to take a look at this!Dark Tidings^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ominous Letter^Nazgrel^^^The Blood is Life^Take the Ominous Letter to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^Giving the lifeless form of Vazruden the Herald the once-over, you discover a rolled letter, its seal yet unbroken. An elaborate "I" is pressed within the blood-red ink. Cracking the note open, the message that you read is most disturbing. Nazgrel back in Thrallmar will definitely want to take a look at this!The Blood is Life^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Gunny^Gunny^^Dark Tidings^^Collect 10 Fel Orc Blood Vials and return them to Gunny at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^That letter is going to get folks all riled up around here. They'll think there's something we might do about all those new fel orcs being created if only we knew how it was being done. It's bad enough that we have to fight the Burning Legion to the east. So, it's your lucky day, sweetness! You get to take a stroll into what they call the Blood Furnace inside Hellfire Citadel. Sounds hot! Get in there, kill some fel orcs and bring back samples of their blood. You think you can handle that?The Blood is Life^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Caza'rez^Caza'rez^^Dark Tidings^^Collect 10 Fel Orc Blood Vials and return them to Centurion Caza'rez at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^That letter is disturbing, and not just because it comes from the Betrayer. We must know how they are creating these new fel orcs if we're to defeat them! It's bad enough that we must fight the Burning Legion on our eastern flank, but now a new army of fel orcs to the west! You must infiltrate this Blood Furnace inside Hellfire Citadel. Bring back samples of blood from the fel orcs that you find in there.Taming the Beast^10^Draenei^Hunter^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Seek Huntress Kella Nightbow^^^Use the Taming Totem to befriend a Barbed Crawler and return to Huntress Kella Nightbow when you have succeeded.^When the <class> first begins <his/her> path, <he/she> learns only to kill. Now it seems you are ready for more. The Stillpine furbolgs have provided a means to master the skill of taming without months of study. They are able to carve a totem into the likeness of an animal, which you can use to temporarily bond with a creature of that type. For your first lesson, take this totem and use it on the barbed crawlers found along the western coast of the isle.Taming the Beast^10^Draenei^Hunter^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Seek Huntress Kella Nightbow^^^Use the Taming Totem to befriend a Greater Timberstrider and return to Huntress Kella Nightbow.^The crawler was undoubtedly mean, but the timberstrider will test your resolve. More powerful allies require more tenacity from the hunter. Take this taming totem and befriend a greater timberstrider. They are found in the northern reaches of Azuremyst Isle.Taming the Beast^10^Draenei^Hunter^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Seek Huntress Kella Nightbow^^^Use the Taming Totem to befriend a Nightstalker and return to Huntress Kella Nightbow.^You probably noticed the big cats known as nightstalkers when you tamed the timberstrider. They are efficient and deadly hunters... and allies. Use this taming totem to befriend a nightstalker. Hunt with the vicious cat and keep it from harm. When you are finished, return to me.Signs of the Legion^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Tzerak's Armor Plate^Vindicator Aalesia^^^^Kill 8 Nazzivus Satyr and 8 Nazzivus Felsworn, then bring Tzerak's Armor Plate to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch.^The armor scrap is forged from a deep black metal that seems to absorb light. Although it doesn't appear to be enchanted, there is an unmistakable sense of wrongness about it. Such armor is only used by one force - the Burning Legion. The Legion's presence here can only mean that they're intending to mobilize the island's satyr against the draenei. Take action against the local satyr, then return to Blood Watch and show this armor scrap to Vindicator Aalesia.Control^11^Alliance^Mage^Semid^Bati^^^Mirror Lake^Kill Murlocs of the Silting Shore to summon a Quel'dorei Magewraith, then destroy it. Afterwards, speak with Bati at the Vault of Lights in the Exodar.^You have chosen the path of the <class>, and so you must learn control. Magic, when unchecked, can corrupt souls and destroy worlds. To fully understand, you must face one who has been consumed by magic. Travel to the beaches on the northwest coast of Azuremyst Isle and use your spells to decimate the murlocs. The display of power will attract the attention of the evil force lurking there, a Quel'dorei magewraith. Defeat it. When you have finished, seek out Bati at the Vault of Lights in the Exodar.Redemption^12^Draenei^Paladin^Jol^Jol^Jol^^^Study the Tome of Divinity and speak with Jol.^I am responsible for putting paladins on the path to greater virtue as they devote themselves to the Light and defend our people from threats. The time has come for you to take your first step towards being truly virtuous. If you accept it, I will give you a tome of divinity. In studying it, you shall learn some about the Light, and what is expected of you. If you understand it, and are capable, then you will succeed in attaining greater abilities.Redemption^12^Draenei^Paladin^Jol^Jol^Jol^^^Jol wants you to resurrect a Young Furbolg Shaman with the Symbol of Life and return to her.^Your task then, <name>, is to aid our new allies, the Stillpine furbolgs. Several of the younger Stillpine shaman stumbled across a Bristlelimb camp and were slaughtered to the last. Take this Symbol of Life and resurrect one of the shaman. Bristlelimb Enclave is located to the east of the road just after you cross the bridge spanning Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle. Speak with me when you have done this.To The Bulwark^52^Horde^Paladin^Champion Bachi^Mehlar Dawnblade^To The Bulwark^^^Speak with Mehlar Dawnblade at the Bulwark.^The blood knight Mehlar Dawnblade has requested an audience with you, <name>. Mehlar can be found at the Bulwark, guarding the passage between Tirisfal Glades and the Western Plaguelands. He is not known for his patience. It would not be wise to keep him waiting.Deliver Them From Evil...^9^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Admiral Odesyus^Exarch Menelaous^The Prophecy of Velen^^Urgent Delivery^Deliver the Traitor's Communication to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.^You must get this information to your people, <name>. While your brave acts have certainly slowed down the plans of Kael'thas and his dark master, the attacks will undoubtedly continue. Take the traitor's communication to your leaders. They must see this for themselves. Perhaps they will be able to better understand some of what was written.Beds, Bandages, and Beyond^10^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Caregiver Topher Loaal^Laando^Beds, Bandages, and Beyond^^^Take Topher's List to Laando, the Hippogryph Master at Blood Watch.^Welcome to Blood Watch, <class>. Please excuse the disorder you see around you. It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing. We've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. Nurguni at the Exodar has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him.On the Wings of a Hippogryph^10^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Laando^Nurguni^Beds, Bandages, and Beyond^^^Purchase a hippogryph ride to the Exodar from Laando. When you land, take Topher's List to Nurguni in the Seat of the Naaru at the Exodar.^For a small fee, you can rent one of my hippogryphs to fly you to the Exodar. Taking the hippogryph is a faster, not to mention safer, alternative for someone carrying an important message. If you'd like to take a ride, speak to me again and I'll make the arrangements.Hippogryph Master Stephanos^10^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Nurguni^Stephanos^Beds, Bandages, and Beyond^^^Find Stephanos outside the Exodar and purchase a hippogryph ride back to Blood Watch.^Here's the box, <name>. That should be enough for Topher to get the inn up and running. Let him know that he can keep sending in orders as the need arises. Blood Watch urgently needs a place to care for the wounded and put up any travelers they receive. When you're ready to return to Blood Watch, seek out Stephanos near the gates of the Exodar.Return to Topher Loaal^10^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Stephanos^Caregiver Topher Loaal^Beds, Bandages, and Beyond^^^Speak with Stephanos to purchase a hippogryph ride back to Blood Watch. Once you have arrived, deliver Nurguni's Supplies to Caregiver Topher Loaal.^If I remember correctly, Blood Watch's hippogryph master is Laando. If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him. That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there. Since you arrived on one of Laando's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Blood Watch with the caregiver's supplies.Heart of Rage^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Gunny^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Weaken the Ramparts^^^Fully investigate the Blood Furnace and then report to Force Commander Danath Trollbane at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^<class>, put together a force to investigate the Blood Furnace inside Hellfire Citadel at once! And that means today, princess! The magic we have at our disposal indicates that something unnatural is occurring in there. But something more powerful inside is blocking any detailed arcane investigations. It figures! You can expect heavy resistance - no other mission that we've sent in there has yet to return! Scout it entirely and then report back to the force commander with what you witness.Heart of Rage^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Caza'rez^Nazgrel^Weaken the Ramparts^^^Fully investigate the Blood Furnace and then report to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^<class>, you must gather a group to investigate the Blood Furnace inside Hellfire Citadel at once! The magical scrying that we have at our disposal indicates that something unnatural is occurring in there. But a powerful force inside is blocking any detailed arcane investigations, so it must be very important. You should expect heavy resistance - no other mission that we've sent in there has ever returned! Scout it entirely and then report back to Nazgrel, advisor to Thrall, with what you witness.Help Watcher Biggs^37^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Anchorite Avuun^Watcher Biggs^Help Watcher Biggs^^^Find Watcher Biggs in the Swamp of Sorrows.^Magtoor has informed me that there's a stranded watcher nearby. Apparently the caravan he was escorting from Darkshire was attacked by Lost Ones. It sounds as if he's the sole survivor. He's somewhere to the south. Please, <class>, lend him your aid.Pool of Tears^43^Alliance^Swamp of Sorrows^Holaaru^Holaaru^^^^Obtain 5 Atal'ai Artifacts and return them to Holaaru at the Harborage in the Swamp of Sorrows.^I am interested in studying Azeroth's past and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to help? There is a nearby place of historical significance within the swamp that I would like for you to venture to. The Pool of Tears lies to the southeast. It is said that upon its shores and within its depths are buried artifacts of the Atal'ai troll civilization. But beware, it is guarded by Somnus, an ancient green dragon, and his dragonkin, as well as carnivorous fish in the pool itself!A Hearty Thanks!^8^Draenei^Azuremyst Isle^Draenei Youngling^Exarch Menelaous^^^^Speak with Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.^You saved my life, <name>! Thank you so much! That beast would have torn me to shreds if it weren't for you. If you see the exarch at Azure Watch, tell him of what you did. I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear such news!Bandits!^7^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Blood Elf Communication^Exarch Menelaous^^^^Take the Blood Elf Communication to Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.^This appears to be a bounty ledger. You cannot understand the blood elf language but you note that there is a picture depicting a dead draenei, a smiling blood elf standing over the corpse, and a symbol of what you think is some sort of blood elf currency. They've put a hit out on draenei! You must inform the exarch.Seek the Farstriders^10^Blood Elf^Hunter^Kary Thunderhorn^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Seek the Farstriders^^^Speak with Lieutenant Dawnrunner at Farstrider Retreat.^Lieutenant Dawnrunner at Farstrider Retreat has requested an audience with all able hunters. It would greatly benefit you to seek her out, <name>. She is a beacon of wisdom for those of our calling. Farstrider Retreat lies south of Silvermoon City.Return the Reports^10^Horde^Rogue^Keltus Darkleaf^Zelanis^Find Keltus Darkleaf^^^Bring Keltus Darkleaf's Reports to Zelanis in Silvermoon City.^Your sleight of hand was most impressive. There's no question that I can trust you to take these reports to Zelanis.The Rune of Summoning^10^Blood Elf^Warlock^Voidstone^Talionia^Return to Talionia^^^Use the Voidstone to summon a Voidwalker in Goldenmist Village, defeat it, and return to Talionia in Silvermoon City.^The voidstone reveals a vision of a multi-story building haunted by ghostly figures. As the scene sharpens and blurs, other buildings come into view, leading you to believe it is Goldenmist Village. Rooftops and tree canopies suddenly flash by, revealing the way to Goldenmist by following the Elrendar River to the west. Once there, use the voidstone near the rune of summoning atop the center building and defeat the summoned voidwalker. Only then can you return to your teacher.The Missing Survey Team^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Harbinger Mikolaas^Draenei Cartographer^Learning from the Crystals^^^Harbinger Mikolaas wants you to find the Survey Team he sent to the Ruins of Loreth'Aran and assist them in any way you can.^As we've gotten ourselves established here at Blood Watch, I've been sending out survey teams to create more reliable maps of the island. In most cases, they returned unharmed with the data we need, but the team I sent east to the ruins hasn't reported back. I worry about what might have happened to them, but I can't spare the men to send another mission after them. Find them, <name>, and lend them any assistance they require to return with their survey data.Envoy to the Horde^21^Blood Elf^Undercity^Lor'themar Theron^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Hero of the Sin'dorei^^^Bring the Letter from Lor'themar Theron to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in Undercity, the Forsaken capital in Tirisfal Glades.^There were doubts about our capabilities among our potential new allies. Of what use could we be to them when perceived as unable to deal with our problems at home? This changes everything. No longer will our power be questioned. We'll be able to join the Horde as equals. Take this letter to Sylvanas, ruler of the Forsaken. She's already on our side but the news of Dar'Khan's death will be music to her ears. Prepare for a long trip, <name>. If all goes well she will send you to Orgrimmar.Warn Your People^11^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^High Chief Stillpine^Exarch Menelaous^^The Kurken is Lurkin'^^Speak with Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch.^The Hold is saved and soon my people will make their way back to the ancestral home. The prophecy has come to pass and a new age of prosperity begins for the Stillpine. But I fear that darkness looms ahead for your own people. There are questions left unanswered - visions of prophecy unseen. Return to your leaders and tell them of what you have seen here. And Promised One, should you ever require the aid of Stillpine, you have merely to ask.Coming of Age^11^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Exarch Menelaous^Torallius the Pack Handler^Coming of Age^^^Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you deliver the Exarch's Orders to Torallius the Pack Handler, standing outside of the Exodar.^You have survived the wilds of our new home and shown yourself a cut above the others. I believe that you have come of age to assist those battling on the front lines of Bloodmyst. The Hand of Argus could use a <race> like you. Report to Torallius the Pack Handler. You will find him outside the Exodar, tending to the elekk. Give him these orders so that he may direct you towards your new duties on Bloodmyst.A Favorite Treat^12^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Aonar^Aonar^^^^Aonar at Kessel's Crossing wants you to bring him 10 Sand Pears.^I've made a wonderful discovery, <class>. On the uncorrupted part of the island grows a remarkable fruit called the sand pear. They're found near the bottoms of the trees. I've been preparing pies from them, but if I'm not careful, the elekk will start to wander over and steal my fruit. I've taken to gathering enough to share with the animals, but my stores are gone and the craving for pie has returned. Would you be willing to help gather the fruit I need for another batch of pies? I promise I'll share!Elekks Are Serious Business^11^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Torallius the Pack Handler^Vorkhan the Elekk Herder^Coming of Age^^Alien Predators^Speak with Vorkhan the Elekk Herder on Bloodmyst Isle.^Is he crazy? Entrusting something like this to some no-named <race> youngling! Just remember this kid: You'll never make it as a Hand of Argus! You don't have the guts! I guess I'll have to humor him this time. Speak with Vorkhan at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle. Just follow the road north from here, and when it forks, just keep on going north.Meeting the Warchief^21^Blood Elf^Orgrimmar^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Thrall^Hero of the Sin'dorei^^^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner wants you to take the Letter Sealed by Sylvanas to Thrall in Orgrimmar, capital of Durotar.^I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know. I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table. This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Thrall in Orgrimmar. As leader of the Horde he will have the final say on accepting your race's pledge. I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.Allegiance to the Horde^21^Blood Elf^Silvermoon City^Thrall^Lor'themar Theron^Hero of the Sin'dorei^^^Return to Silvermoon City and report back to Lor'themar Theron.^Your people suffered a great betrayal by the Alliance. You've succeeded in fending off Darnassian attacks as well as spies from Ironforge. Now you've defeated a powerful Scourge leader at the footsteps of your home. Your worthiness is no longer in question. It is now apparent that you need us and we need you. Return to Lor'themar. Tell him I received his message loud and clear. <The warchief crushes the letter inside his palm.> Welcome to the Horde, elf.Salvaging the Data^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Draenei Cartographer^Harbinger Mikolaas^Learning from the Crystals^^^Obtain the Survey Data Crystal from the Wrathscale near the dead cartographers and return it to Harbinger Mikolaas at Blood Watch.^It's too late to assist the cartographers in completing their mission, but it appears they collected the data Harbinger Mikolaas was expecting. The crystal storing their survey information was not among their ransacked packs, so it must be in the hands of the Wrathscale naga. You know that Harbinger Mikolaas will be saddened by the loss of the survey crew, but would want to salvage the survey data.Catch and Release^13^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Morae^Morae^Catch and Release^^^Morae at Blood Watch wants you to 'mark' 6 Blacksilt Scouts using the Murloc Tagger.^The Blacksilt murlocs on the southwestern coast are curious creatures. In some ways, they act barely sentient, yet in others, they show a remarkable degree of organization. I have a few theories about that, but no real way to test them until recently. I've devised a method that will allow me to track the murlocs I'm interested in without doing any lasting harm or interfering with their natural behavior. If you're willing to help with the marking, I'll gladly pay you for your assistance.Medivh's Journal^70^All^The Violet Eye^Archmage Alturus^Wravien^Medivh's Journal^^^Archmage Alturus at Deadwind Pass wants you to go into Karazhan and speak to Wravien.^Your name is getting around, <name>. You've made your way into and out of Karazhan - more than most mortals can claim. I need to ask a special favor of you. As part of our research, the Violet Eye has been trying to track down Medivh's own journal. Unfortunately, none of the agents we've sent inside have come out. Wravien was the last to be sent; see if you can find him and see about any leads on the journal.A Colleague's Aid^70^All^Netherstorm^Archmage Alturus^Kalynna Lathred^Medivh's Journal^^^Take the Charred Bone Fragment to Kalynna Lathred at Area 52 in Netherstorm.^There is a small detail I've forgotten to take into account. The residue of Medivh's essence contained in this bone fragment is completely devoid of life - just like Arcanagos. There is a way, however. And I know just the person to help us. Travel to Area 52 in Netherstorm and show the bone fragment to Kalynna Lathred. She will know just what to do.Newfound Allies^15^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Anchorite Paetheus^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Newfound Allies^^^Take the Letter of Introduction to Huntress Kella Nightbow in Azuremyst Isle.^Harbinger Mikolaas has done a commendable job of safeguarding Blood Watch, <class>, but our enemies are many and our resources few. Our weakness is well known to our enemies, but your contact with the forces of the Alliance is something they haven't accounted for. I have prepared a letter of introduction to the people of Auberdine, the closest Alliance settlement, proposing cooperation in the fight against our foes. Take it with you and seek out Huntress Kella Nightbow near the docks west of the Exodar.The Way to Auberdine^15^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Thundris Windweaver^Newfound Allies^^^Take the boat from the dock near Huntress Kella Nightbow to Auberdine. Once you have arrived in Auberdine, take the Letter of Introduction to Thundris Windweaver.^If you wait out on the dock, you'll see the boat arriving from the port of Auberdine in Darkshore. Once it has offloaded its passengers, you'll be able to board. After a short journey, the boat will put in at Auberdine and you'll be able to deliver your message. It's probably best to take this to Thundris Windweaver, an old friend of mine and a well-respected citizen of the town.Alien Predators^11^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vorkhan the Elekk Herder^Vorkhan the Elekk Herder^^Elekks Are Serious Business^^Kill 10 Bloodmyst Hatchlings then return to Vorkhan the Elekk Herder at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle.^One thing we've learned in our travels is that extreme care must be taken when introducing wildlife from one world to another. When the Exodar crashed, it was carrying specimens of various Outland species, including an insectoid predator called the ravager. Some of the specimens were lost, but many others survived and took to the wild. If we don't keep them in check, they will upset the natural balance here on the islands. You'll find these ravagers to the west of Kessel's Crossing, near the coast.The Zapthrottle Mote Extractor!^60^All^Engineering^Mack Diver^Mack Diver^^^^Bring 15 Steam Pump Parts to Mack Diver at Zabra'jin in Zangarmarsh.^The swamp gas is truly amazing, and can be very useful, mon! But first, you gotta be able to suck it up, and that, my friend, requires a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor. Now, I could just give you the schematics, but I'll need something in return first. How about some spare parts? Last time I checked, there were plenty laying around near the broken steam pump at the Dead Mire, far to the northeast. I heard that the withered giants spread the pieces all over that dried-out lake bed.The Zapthrottle Mote Extractor!^60^Alliance^Engineering^K. Lee Smallfry^K. Lee Smallfry^^^^Bring 15 Steam Pump Parts to K. Lee Smallfry at Telredor in Zangarmarsh.^Have you seen the swamp gas? Isn't it just shiny? It takes a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor to suck 'em dry though. I could give you the plans to make one, but I really need some spare parts to fix stuff 'round here. Last time I checked, there were plenty of parts laying around near the steam pump at the Dead Mire to the northeast. I think the withered giants broke the pump out there. Shall we help each other out?Kalynna's Request^70^All^Netherstorm^Kalynna Lathred^Kalynna Lathred^Medivh's Journal^^^Kalynna Lathred wants you to retrieve the Tome of Dusk from Grand Warlock Nethekurse in the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel and the Book of Forgotten Names from Darkweaver Syth in the Sethekk Halls in Auchindoun.^I left the Kirin Tor in pursuit of knowledge forbidden by those of my order; it is beyond ironic that I am now asked to assist them with that very same knowledge. If I'm to perform this favor for you, you will have to do something for me first. I want you to obtain two of the tomes I've been searching for. The first one is called the Tome of Dusk and is owned by the orc warlock known as Nethekurse. The second, known as the Book of Forgotten Names, belongs to the arakkoa known as Darkweaver Syth.In Good Hands^70^All^The Violet Eye^Wravien^Gradav^Medivh's Journal^^^Speak to Gradav at the Guardian's Library in Karazhan.^Was I supposed to be looking for this journal? It can't be... I don't quite recall... Of course! It is Gradav you're thinking of. He was looking for the book when I got here. Surely he must've found it by now; why don't you go ask him about it? I'd lend you a hand... but these books are just so... interesting!Kamsis^70^All^The Violet Eye^Gradav^Kamsis^Medivh's Journal^^^Speak to Kamsis at the Guardian's Library in Karazhan.^Journal, what journal? You're thinking of Kamsis, surely. Go and ask her about it. I can't leave my project right now or all my work will be wasted!The Shade of Aran^70^All^The Violet Eye^Kamsis^Kamsis^Medivh's Journal^^^Obtain Medivh's Journal and return to Kamsis at the Guardian's Library in Karazhan.^Let me think for a second. The Violet Eye... Medivh's Journal... Why yes, it's all coming back to me now. I believe I had the journal you're looking for before I started to read these scrolls... Aran... yes, Aran asked me for the book. So nicely too. I just had to give it to him. He's Medivh's father after all, did you know?Irradiated Crystal Shards^15^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Boros^Vindicator Boros^^^More Irradiated Crystal Shards^Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to bring him 10 Irradiated Crystal Shards.^The Exodar's crash scattered pieces of fouled crystals all over Bloodmyst Isle, corrupting the water and the landscape. We've even begun finding pieces of the crystals inside the flesh of animals taken for meat. I've uncovered a way to purify the shard and turn them into functional crystals, so if you bring me enough shards, I'll trade one of my completed crystals for them. So far I've found the shards in the bodies of bears, ravagers, flutterers, and treants inhabiting the corrupted part of the island.Constrictor Vines^15^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Tracker Lyceon^Tracker Lyceon^^^Culling the Flutterers^Tracker Lyceon at Blood Watch wants you to bring him 6 Thorny Constrictor Vines.^A good woodsman makes use of every available resource, <class>. Even the most bizarre creatures possess attributes we can use to our advantage. With Blood Watch under constant assault from the Sunhawks, we're looking to a variety of natural defenses including traps. The lasher's thorny vines are perfectly suited to the construction of the traps I have in mind. The combination of sharp spines and deadly toxin will fell unwary attackers. Bring me the vines of mutated constrictors so that I can begin my work.Nightbane^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Kalynna Lathred^Archmage Alturus^Medivh's Journal^^^Go to the Master's Terrace in Karazhan and touch the Blackened Urn to summon Nightbane. Retrieve the Faint Arcane Essence from Nightbane's corpse and bring it to Archmage Alturus.^You fulfilled your end of the deal. I will now bind your essence to that of the dead blue dragon. There is an urn in the Master's Terrace, should you touch that urn, you'll now release its energy anl bring life back to the charred remains of Arcanagos. Defeat the creature and retrieve its essence immediately! You will need to take it to Alturus. Should you fail, the stars predict you will have let a great terror loose upon the skies. A terror known as Nightbane!The Master's Terrace^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Kamsis^Archmage Alturus^Medivh's Journal^^^Go to the Master's Terrace in Karazhan and read Medivh's Journal. Return to Archmage Alturus with Medivh's Journal after completing this task.^Journal? What journal? Oh, right. That journal! The Violet Eye sent me here for it. It's all coming back now. <Kamsis points to a page in the journal.> This is the page that Alturus is interested in. Did you know that while other people's journals serve as a record of their memories, Medivh's is literally just that? Try it. Go to the Master's Terrace and read the page; you'll see just what I mean. Might as well report to Alturus while you're at it. I'm afraid I'll be here for a while.WANTED: Deathclaw^17^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Wanted Poster^Harbinger Mikolaas^^^^Bring Deathclaw's Paw to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.^By order of Harbinger Mikolaas: A bounty of 18 silver to be paid to the brave soul who returns with proof of the marauding bear Deathclaw's demise. Deathclaw should be considered extremely dangerous and is responsible for the killing of a survey team on the coast to the northwest of Blood Watch. Travelers are advised to avoid the area.Culling the Flutterers^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Tracker Lyceon^Tracker Lyceon^^Constrictor Vines^^Tracker Lyceon at Blood Watch wants you to kill 10 Royal Blue Flutterers.^When we first encountered flutterers, they showed few signs of mutation. As the corruption got progressively worse, the moths and other species began to show signs of contamination. It has progressed to the point where they damage nearly everything they come in contact with. They're amplifying the damage being done by the crystal shards scattered by the Exodar's crash. We have no choice but to begin culling their population in the lands north of Blood Watch.Mac'Aree Mushroom Menagerie^14^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Jessera of Mac'Aree^Jessera of Mac'Aree^^^Ysera's Tears^Jessera of Mac'Aree at Blood Watch wants 1 Aquatic Stinkhorn, 1 Blood Mushroom, 1 Ruinous Polyspore, and 1 Fel Cone Fungus.^Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers! What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me.Ysera's Tears^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Jessera of Mac'Aree^Jessera of Mac'Aree^^Mac'Aree Mushroom Menagerie^^Jessera of Mac'Aree at Blood Watch wants 2 Ysera's Tears.^Good to see you again, <name>! You were exceptionally efficient in completing the last task that I offered you. Perhaps you would be interested in another? To the northeast lies Wyrmscar Island, home to a rare species of mushroom known as Ysera's tear - named after the green dragonlings that inhabit the island. I only require a small sampling of the mushroom, but I must warn you that the denizens of the island do not welcome visitors. Tread carefully.The Kessel Run^12^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Kessel^Kessel^The Kessel Run^^^Kessel at Kessel's Crossing wants you to warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing of the imminent blood elf invasion. Return to Kessel when you complete this task. You have 15 minutes. (Be sure to keep it out of water.)^You're just in time, <name>. Blood elf activity in this area has doubled in the past week. Our agents have informed us that the blood elves that call themselves Sunhawks plan to launch an offensive upon Azuremyst soon. I need you to get a warning out to our allies and compatriots. Warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing. Time is of the essence so I am lending you my elekk. Be sure to keep it out of water.Establishing New Outposts^60^Alliance^Eastern Plaguelands^Emissary Whitebeard^Emissary Whitebeard^^^^Capture Crown Guard Tower, Eastwall Tower, Northpass Tower and Plaguewood Tower in the Eastern Plaguelands, then return to Emmisary Whitebeard at Light's Hope Chapel.^Welcome to the Plaguelands, <name>. As you know, the Forsaken and their allies hold the lands to the west of here against our best efforts. The Alliance commanders have decided that here in the east, we will establish new fortifications to tighten the noose around our enemies. Towers long abandoned since the days of Lordaeron are to be seized and rebuilt for this purpose. These lands are dangerous, and we could use your help.Bolstering Our Defenses^60^Horde^Eastern Plaguelands^Emissary Gormok^Emissary Gormok^^^^Capture Crown Guard Tower, Eastwall Tower, Northpass Tower and Plaguewood Tower in the Eastern Plaguelands, then return to Emmisary Gormok at Light's Hope Chapel.^Agents of the Forsaken uncovered an Alliance plot to establish new bases here in the Eastern Plaguelands, at abandoned towers throughout the area. It is imperative that we not allow them to establish a significant presence on our eastern borders, and so we must stave off this Alliance incursion. Our current plans are to drive them out of any towers they may have already seized, and occupy those that we have under our control against further attacks.Declaration of Power^13^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Kessel^Kessel^The Kessel Run^^^Kessel at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle wants you to kill Lord Xiz at Wrathscale Lair and drive the Draenei Banner through his dead body.^Have you seen the serpent men? The ones that call themselves naga? <Kessel spits.> They dared make an advance upon this camp under cover of darkness only three nights ago. Can you believe the audacity of those primitive beasts? I need you to deliver a message to their leadership, <name>. To the northeast is Wrathscale Lair, home to Lord Xiz. Find him, slay him where he stands and drive this banner through his corpse. Let them know fear whenever they should see our standard!Saving Princess Stillpine^13^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Princess Stillpine^Stillpine Ambassador Frasaboo^^Learning the Language^^Release Princess Stillpine from her cage and then speak with Stillpine Ambassador Frasaboo at Blood Watch.^Help me, <name>! The Bristlelimb captured me and are planning to sacrifice me to their foul gods! High Chief Bristlelimb holds the key that opens the cage. To force him to appear, you must slaughter the evil Bristlelimb furbolgs that inhabit the enclave, just two camps to the west of this camp. If you kill enough of them, he will surely come for vengeance! When he shows up, kill him and get the key! My father will richly reward you if you can save me!Report to Exarch Admetius^13^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Kessel^Exarch Admetius^The Kessel Run^^^Speak with Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch.^A Hand of Argus soldier is many things: Obedient, brave, intelligent, and above all, honorable. You may yet exhibit some of these traits, <class>. Report to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch if you are still interested in joining the Hand. He and his subordinates will further train you in the ways of the draenei soldier. And remember this, <name>: Honorable people do not always perform honorably. Sometimes they cannot. You will find Blood Watch just up this road, to the north.The Missing Expedition^19^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Achelus^Achelus^^^^Kill 8 Myst Spinners, 8 Myst Leechers and their leader, Zarakh. Return to Achelus at Blood Watch when the task is complete.^About a week ago, my research team and I were out exploring the western wilds of Bloodmyst when we were attacked by bloodthirsty spiders. The effect of the crystal contamination was clearly evident as these spiders were massive and extremely aggressive. I managed to escape but my team wasn't so lucky. We must not let the same fate befall others. Go west to the Amberweb Pass and destroy the spiders and their matriarch, Zarakh.They're Alive! Maybe...^19^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Researcher Cornelius^Researcher Cornelius^^^^Researcher Cornelius has asked that you free 5 Expedition Researchers.^It was a bloody mess, <name>. We were ambushed by a large pack of these spiders. Their progenitor descended upon us with incredible speed and wrapped us up in cocoons. After we were webbed, she began to lay eggs near us. We were to be food for her young! FOOD! I managed to cut my way out and escape but I will not leave the others behind. So far I've been unsuccessful in nearing the pass. Would you lend a hand? Destroy those cocoons! Hopefully some of our team is still alive!The Bloodcurse Legacy^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^A Letter from the Admiral^Captain Edward Hanes^The Bloodcurse Legacy^Urgent Delivery^The Bloodcursed Naga^Admiral Odesyus has asked that you find and speak with Captain Edward Hanes.^Dear friend, My hand trembles as I ink this letter. I pray that it reaches you in time. Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago. This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of your base? Regards, Admiral OdesyusBeast Training^10^Blood Elf^Hunter^Lieutenant Dawnrunner^Halthenis^Seek the Farstriders^^^Speak with Halthenis in Silvermoon City.^Beyond bonding with your chosen pet, there remains the intricacies of caring and training it. For this, Halthenis the beast trainer of Silvermoon City can show you the way. He always shows the utmost respect for my students, if they do the same for him. Do not disappoint me.The Bloodcursed Naga^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Captain Edward Hanes^Captain Edward Hanes^The Bloodcurse Legacy^^^Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to kill 10 Bloodcursed Naga.^They say when the world was sundered, this land cried the loudest. It was here that thousands of night elves faded into oblivion and in their place rose terrible creatures of hate - the naga. Obedient to their twisted queen, Azshara, they would destroy all that would dare pass through their sea. It would remain this way for thousands of years - until now. The first order of business is to remove the bloodcursed naga from the reef.Beast Training^10^Draenei^Hunter^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Ganaar^Seek Huntress Kella Nightbow^^^Speak with Ganaar at the Traders Tier of the Exodar.^Oh, one more thing! You'll want to speak with Ganaar at the Exodar. He'll be able to teach you the last bits of knowledge necessary to care for your pet and train it. You can find him in the southwest corner of the Traders Tier.Paladin Training^1^Blood Elf^Paladin^Magistrix Erona^Jesthenis Sunstriker^^Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle^Well Watcher Solanian^Speak with Jesthenis Sunstriker - the Paladin class trainer - inside the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you. For young paladins here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Jesthenis Sunstriker. Speak with Jesthenis and see what training he has available for you. The things he will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you. Your trainer - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^12^Blood Elf^Paladin^Noellene^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^^^Speak with Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Farstriders' Square in Silvermoon City.^<name>, you have excelled in your early training and distinguished yourself among those who would become Blood Knights. You are ready to undertake the next phase of your training and, to that end, Knight-Lord Bloodvalor himself has asked to speak with you. I have no doubt that Knight-Lord Bloodvalor wishes to set a trial for you to test your abilities and training. You will find him in the Blood Knight headquarters in Silvermoon City's Farstriders' Square. I wish you well, <name>.The First Trial^12^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^^^Travel to the island Knight-Lord Bloodvalor described, find the cave, and light the brazier. When the First Trial is over, return to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Silvermoon City.^You have learned much of combat and bloodshed, initiate, but there is much more to our order. Mastery of the Light requires a focused mind and tremendous willpower. Without these, you are little better than a street thug. There is an island in the northeastern reaches of the Ghostlands, called the Isle of Tribulations, that we use to hone these skills. You will find a brazier within a shallow cave there. Kneel before the brazier, light it, and focus on what you see before your eyes.Digging Up the Past^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Archmage Alturus^Archmage Alturus^Medivh's Journal^^^Archmage Alturus wants you to go to the mountains south of Karazhan in Deadwind Pass and retrieve a Charred Bone Fragment.^Kamsis was right! This information is extremely important. If Medivh weaved his own essence into the magic he used to defeat the dragon, it is quite possible we could retrieve even a faint residue of that essence from the dragon's remains. What great insight may lie beneath the ashes of Deadwind Pass, awaiting discovery. Go to the mountains south of Karazhan and bring me back a bone fragment of seemingly draconic origin.A Study in Power^12^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Magister Astalor Bloodsworn^Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^^^Speak with Magister Astalor Bloodsworn in the hidden chamber beneath Blood Knight headquarters.^Do not think me unduly harsh, <name>. Stillblade knew well what he was being sent to do. He understood and accepted his duty and is an example for all aspiring Blood Knights. My words are no eulogy, <name>. Stillblade's service to us is far from over and you will be the instrument of his resurrection. Your education in the order's ways has just begun. With the betrayal of Kael'thas and the loss of our power source, you must learn new methods of wielding the Light. Seek out Magister Astalor Bloodsworn.The Hopeless Ones...^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Captain Edward Hanes^Captain Edward Hanes^The Bloodcurse Legacy^^^Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to recover 4 Bloodcursed Souls.^On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the bloodcursed naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the bloodcurse. It is regrettable, what I ask of you now... but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me. Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task.Ending the Bloodcurse^19^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Captain Edward Hanes^Captain Edward Hanes^The Bloodcurse Legacy^^^Captain Edward Hanes on Wyrmscar Island wants you to destroy the Statue of Queen Azshara and kill Atoph the Bloodcursed.^To the south you will find Bloodcurse Isle. Atop the island you will find a shrine dedicated to the beloved queen of the naga, Azshara. Destroy the statue - burn it in effigy! This will surely draw the ire of Atoph, the Bloodcursed leader. Slay Atoph and return to me!Claiming the Light^12^Blood Elf^Paladin^Magister Astalor Bloodsworn^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^^^Use the Shimmering Vessel on the Blood Elf Magisters to fill it and return to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Silvermoon City.^Take this vessel, <name>. The enchantment it bears will allow you to draw the last vestiges of the Light surrounding these magisters. They once tended the captive naaru and some of its energy yet remains within them. It will be just enough to restore your comrade to life. Do not worry about the magisters, <name>. I have seen to their care, and Lord Solanar assures me that Lady Liadrin seeks a new source of power even now.Redeeming the Dead^12^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Summons from Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^^^Take the Filled Shimmering Vessel to Silvermoon City's inn and use its magic to resurrect Sangrias Stillblade.^While you were preparing the vessel, I sent a group of initiates to retrieve Sangrias Stillblade. You will find him on the top level of Silvermoon's inn with an attendant. Make your way there with all haste and unleash the vessel's magic to restore him to life. Time is of the essence, <name>. Once he has been dead for too long, not even the Light can bring him back to us. Return to me once you have resurrected Stillblade.The Second Trial^20^Blood Elf^Paladin^Master Kelerun Bloodmourn^Master Kelerun Bloodmourn^The Second Trial^^^Complete the Second Trial by defeating Champion Bloodwrath, Champion Lightrend, Champion Swiftblade, and Champion Sunstriker in the pavilion near Master Kelerun Bloodmourn.^You stand on the verge of adept status in the order, <name>. First, you must prove your worthiness by undertaking another trial. The Second Trial differs from the first in that there will be no surprises this time. The challenge before you is simple; you must face and best four Blood Knight champions in combat. When you accept the challenge, a crystal will appear in the middle of the pavilion. Touch it to begin your trial and do not stray far from the building. Are you prepared?Restoring Sanctity^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Prince Toreth^Prince Toreth^^^Into the Dream^Prince Toreth on Wyrmscar Island wants you to recover 8 Dragon Bones.^Not long ago, the once tranquil owlkin of the region appeared on the shores of this island. One by one they would come to steal the bones of the fallen dragons. I do not know what would cause these creatures such distress or why they would want the bones of the deceased, but the spirits of the brood have grown restless due to this sacrilege. To the west, across the Crimson Reach, you will find Ragefeather Ridge. Venture to the owlkin encampments and recover the pilfered dragon bones.Into the Dream^19^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Prince Toreth^Prince Toreth^^Restoring Sanctity^Razormaw^Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay 5 Viridian Whelps and 5 Viridian Broodlings.^The whelps that you see on this island are the agitated spirits of the green dragonflight. Like me, they are bound to the land, unable to ascend to their final resting place in the Dream. Recovering the bones of the fallen has settled them somewhat but you must take further action. Destroy their ethereal manifestations. I cannot leave this place until it is done. They must be released!Razormaw^21^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Prince Toreth^Prince Toreth^^Into the Dream^^Prince Toreth at Wyrmscar Island has asked that you slay Razormaw.^Many of the black dragonflight were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of Deathwing himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death. Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the ever-burning pyre. This act should signal Razormaw to descend. When he does, slay his undead form.The Second Trial^20^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Master Kelerun Bloodmourn^The Second Trial^^^Report to Master Kelerun Bloodmourn.^Initiate <name>, you have worked hard to master the powers of the Light won by our magisters. You have learned the source of our abilities and of the duties of a Blood Knight. The time has come for you to undergo the Second Trial, and contest for status as an adept among the Blood Knights. The trial will be administered by Master Kelerun Bloodmourn at a location north of the city. Travel north through the Ruins of Silvermoon and take the east path immediately before the bridge to Sunstrider Isle.Return to Silvermoon^20^Blood Elf^Paladin^Master Kelerun Bloodmourn^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^The Second Trial^^^Return to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Silvermoon City.^Return to Silvermoon City and report to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor promptly. Your arrival will tell him all he needs to know about the outcome of the trial. He will tell you of your remaining tasks on the road to becoming an adept. Hold your head high, <name>. Many undertake this trial, but very few return to tell of their success.The Path of the Adept^23^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^The Second Trial^^^Bring a Corrupted Kor Gem, a Crate of Bloodforged Ingots, a quantity of Blood of the Wrathful, and a Blood Knight Insignia to Knight-Lord Bloodvalor in Silvermoon City.^Before a newly-minted adept can be accepted into the ranks of the Blood Knights, <he/she> must procure the resources to create our order's distinctive weapon, the blood-tempered ranseur. You must also earn the right to wear our order's insignia. When the order was founded, a set number were forged and distributed, so each new adept inherits <his/hers> from a veteran. Your insignia will come from a fallen knight who bravely led an assault on Deatholme. I have prepared a set of notes to guide you.What Argus Means to Me^15^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Exarch Admetius^Vindicator Boros^What Argus Means to Me^^^Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch has told you to speak with Vindicator Boros.^What does Argus mean to you, <name>? Many draenei probably do not know or remember our home planet. It is there that we split from the man'ari: the twisted demonic reflections of ourselves that were 'gifted' by Sargeras. Or as they call themselves, eredar. Eredar... this word once held meaning. <Admetius smacks his lips as if to taste the word.> Disgusting. Let us not waste anymore time. Find Vindicator Boros to begin your training.Blood Watch^15^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Boros^Vindicator Boros^What Argus Means to Me^^Intercepting the Message^Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Spies.^Blood Watch is one of two forward bases operated by the Hand of Argus. You have already been to the other base, Azure Watch; things are completely different in Bloodmyst. When we first got here, the land was as beautiful as Azuremyst. We even called it Silvergale but now sickness is spreading across the land, worse yet, the blood elves that we were battling on the Exodar survived the crash. This brings me to your assignment: Venture northwest into Bladewood and terminate any blood elves that you find.Translations...^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Boros^Interrogator Elysia^The Sun King's Command^^^Take the Sunhawk Missive to Interrogator Elysia at Blood Watch.^Our chief interrogator, Elysia, is fluent in Thalassian. Take the document to her and see what she has to say.Watcher Leesa'oh^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Lethyn Moonfire^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^^^Speak with Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.^There's important research to be conducted into the ecology of the local creatures, especially the sporelings and bog lords of the marsh. And trust me, once you get out into the field, you'll find the work to be challenging. Seek out Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in the western region of the marsh toward the south. Follow the path west and you will eventually find her. She can be a bit -- studious -- but don't let that get to you. Oh, and watch out for her cat.Audience with the Prophet^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Interrogator Elysia^Prophet Velen^The Sun King's Command^^^Take the Translated Sunhawk Missive to Prophet Velen at the Exodar.^I need you to deliver the translated documents to Velen personally, <name>. I don't trust that deranged messenger. Explain to the Prophet that the blood elves are receiving reinforcements from the Outland and that they have a spy amongst the draenei at the Exodar. Velen resides in the Vault of Lights inside the Exodar. Make haste!Truth or Fiction^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Prophet Velen^Vindicator Boros^The Sun King's Command^^^Take Velen's Orders to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch.^I thank you for the timely delivery, <name>. You are turning out to be one of the Hand's better agents. If only we knew who they reported to in Bloodmyst and more importantly, where this sun portal was... They seem to have it tightly guarded - wherever it may be. Would you be interested in some reconnaissance work? If so, take these orders back to Vindicator Boros. He will give you your next mission.I Shoot Magic Into the Darkness^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Boros^Vindicator Boros^The Sun King's Command^^The Cryo-Core^Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch wants you to locate the Sun Portal Site and slay 5 Void Anomalies.^Velen states that if the blood elves have been opening rifts between this island and the Outland, there will be residue or anomalies left in the areas where the portals have been opened. You must search the island for locations that exhibit or display these anomalies. Be warned, <name>; some of these anomalies will be creatures from the void itself. Should you find void anomalies, slay them! Report back to me with any new information that you may find. Begin your search to the north, near the Warp Piston.Observing the Sporelings^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^^^Investigate the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh, and then report back to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh with your findings.^We need to learn all that we can of the sporelings at Sporeggar and their relationship to the creatures around them. One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions. I need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west. Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw.A Question of Gluttony^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^^^Collect 10 pieces of Discarded Nutriment and then return to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.^I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the Spawning Glen - they must be starving for some reason. This just will not do! I mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out! Here's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the Quagg Ridge to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the sporelings.The Cryo-Core^17^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Kuros^Vindicator Kuros^^I Shoot Magic Into the Darkness^Don't Drink the Water^Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to recover 12 boxes of Medical Supplies.^We have others pursuing leads on the sun portals, <name>. I need you to focus on the task at hand. Boros has received new reports of another crash site. What we've since discovered is that the crash site is actually the Exodar's cryo-core. This is a pod holding area that houses pods exactly like the ones we draenei crawled out of in Ammen Vale. This area also holds medical supplies. Head to the Cryo-Core, directly west of Blood Watch. Search for supplies and search for survivors.Slain by the Wretched^5^Horde^Eversong Woods^Outrunner Alarion^Slain Outrunner^Aiding the Outrunners^^^Go south into the ruins of Silvermoon and look for the Slain Outrunner in Dawning Lane.^It's hard work being an outrunner between Sunstrider Isle and Falconwing Square. Tight deadlines, long hours and worst of all... the Wretched! The road south goes through the ruins of Silvermoon... the place is crawling with Wretched ready to kill you for a few mana crystals. Unfortunately, I think that's what happened to the last outrunner we sent with one of Erona's packages. I see you're eager to prove yourself. Venture into Dawning Lane and see if you can find any traces of our outrunner.Package Recovery^5^Horde^Eversong Woods^Slain Outrunner^Outrunner Alarion^Aiding the Outrunners^^Completing the Delivery^Return to Outrunner Alarion with Erona's Package.^You take the package and confirm that indeed it comes from Magistrix Erona. Alarion would probably want you to bring it to her.Galaen's Journal - The Fate of Vindicator Saruan^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Galaen's Journal^Vindicator Kuros^^Searching for Galaen^Matis the Cruel^Take Galaen's Journal to Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch.^Your hands tremble as you pick up the book. Kuros must be told about this tragedy. Return the book to him.Forging the Weapon^23^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Bemarrin^The Second Trial^^^Take the Crate of Materials to Bemarrin in Silvermoon City.^Once again, you have proven yourself worthy before the order and your peers. It is with great pleasure that I bestow upon you the rank of adept, <name>. Prince Kael'thas himself would be proud of you. Any of us would be honored to fight by your side on the field of battle. Continue to serve as an example for those who aspire to join us. Show neither mercy nor weakness, defend your people and your brothers tirelessly, and hone your mastery of the Light. Now, claim the weapon befitting your new rank.Familiar Fungi^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^^^Collect 15 Mushroom Samples and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.^Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh! To the north is a place known as the Hewn Bog. Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there. I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis. Just be careful, <class>. I'd heard that ogres have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them. Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food?Stealing Back the Mushrooms^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^Watcher Leesa'oh^^^Collect 10 Boxes of Mushrooms and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.^<class>, I've got an idea. I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of ogre territory! Northwest of the Hewn Bog there is a place named Ango'rosh Stronghold, which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge. The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there. I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too! Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the bog lords with a new source of nourishment.The Blood-Tempered Ranseur^23^Blood Elf^Paladin^Bemarrin^Bemarrin^The Second Trial^^^Wait while Bemarrin forges your weapon.^I've got everything prepared, <name>. Very soon you will have a weapon befitting your new status.Matis the Cruel^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Kuros^Vindicator Kuros^^Galaen's Journal - The Fate of Vindicato^^Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to capture Matis the Cruel.^Matis will be brought to justice, <name>; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate. Scour the island for this killer. Should you find him, use this flare gun. When my trackers see the flare, they'll come and assist in capturing Matis. Return to me after he's been captured.Bring Me A Shrubbery!^65^All^The Underbog^Gzhun'tt^Gzhun'tt^^^Bring Me Another Shrubbery!^Collect 5 Sanguine Hibiscus and return them to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^We must replenish our supply of sanguine hibiscus, which we use for a number of purposes. They used to grow thick as shrubs, but the lowering of the marsh's water levels means that they can only be found now in the Underbog at Coilfang Reservoir, under Serpent Lake. It is said that the shamblers, bog giants, and underbats there consider them a delicacy. So, if you are to help us, you must retrieve the flowers from them.Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Ysiel Windsinger^Ysiel Windsinger^Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake^^^Investigate the cause of the water depletion at Umbrafen Lake. Then return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^We came to Outland expecting to find small pockets of life. What we discovered in Zangarmarsh was a lush environment with a thriving ecosystem. Our initial assessment of the area was deceiving, however. The water levels at the lakes and marshes have consistently been going down since we started taking measurements. The impact this could have on the local animal and plant life is disastrous. Go to Umbrafen Lake, southwest of here, and look for clues related to this water depletion.Oh, It's On!^65^All^The Underbog^T'shu^T'shu^^^^Gather an Underspore Frond and return it to T'shu at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^While we are a peaceful people, we are at war with the spore giants, whether we like it or not. And there is a saying amongst us that all is fair in mushrooms and war! One of the leaders of the spore giants, Hungerfen, has been tending a very special plant, known as the Underspore, to perfection for millennia. It would break his spirit if something were to happen to that plant. Travel to the Underbog in Coilfang Reservoir and steal a frond off of it for us. Trust me, he'll notice.As the Crow Flies^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Ysiel Windsinger^Ysiel Windsinger^Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake^^^Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Stormcrow Amulet to explore the major lakes in Zangarmarsh.^We must determine how widespread the naga's activity truly is and react accordingly. Exploring each body of water in Zangarmarsh could be a lengthy undertaking. If you allow me to, I will use my magic to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh. Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin. I will guide your way back to safety after we're done.Stalk the Stalker^65^All^The Underbog^Khn'nix^Khn'nix^^^^Bring the Brain of the Black Stalker to Khn'nix at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^Historically the greatest danger to my people has been from the marsh walkers. With the new problems we are facing from spore giants, we cannot afford another attack from our ancient enemies. You have proven yourself to be capable, <class>. Do you think that you'd be able to journey to the Underbog in Coilfang Reservoir and eliminate the great mother of the marsh walkers, known as The Black Stalker?! Bring me her brain as proof.Balance Must Be Preserved^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Ysiel Windsinger^Ysiel Windsinger^Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake^^^Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Ironvine Seeds on the Steam Pump Controls at Serpent Lake, Umbrafen Lake, Marshlight Lake and the Lagoon. Then return to her at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh with any leftover seeds you have.^I cannot begin to comprehend why the naga would drain the water out of their own habitat. What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations. These seeds carry with them the rage of the earth. Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls. The vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron. Go, <name>. Restore the balance that the naga have upset.A Summons from Lord Solanar^60^Blood Elf^Paladin^Knight-Lord Bloodvalor^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Speak with Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City.^Your dedication to our order and advancement through the ranks has not gone unnoticed. In fact, Lord Solanar Bloodwrath, Lady Liadrin's right hand and a hero in his own right, has asked to speak with you. This is a rare honor, <name>. Normally, Lord Solanar leaves the management of the order's rank-and-file to me, but he has taken a personal interest in you. Do not tarry, <name>.The Master's Path^60^Blood Elf^Paladin^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Speak with Lord Solanar Bloodwrath again to accept his offer of sponsorship.^Within the ranks of our order, there exists an inner circle of elite knights. Members of the circle represent the most dedicated, skilled, and trustworthy of all Blood Knights and are handpicked by the leadership. Most simply know the masters by their thalassian charger mounts. Each candidate for membership must have a sponsor within the circle and must demonstrate their dedication to the order's central tenets. I have chosen to sponsor you for standing as a Blood Knight master, if this is your wish.A Gesture of Commitment^60^Blood Elf^Paladin^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Bring 40 Runecloth, 6 Arcanite Bars, 10 Sungrass, 5 Dark Runes, and 150 Gold to Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City.^A Blood Knight's loyalty does not stop at the end of <his/her> blade, <name>. The order asks more of its members than mere drilling and combat. A true knight contributes to all of the order's activities, even the ones that may not seem glorious on the surface. This first task is neither combat intensive, nor glorious, but without such contributions, the order would fall apart. I will give you a list of items Magister Astalor Bloodsworn's men require to keep us supplied with Light energy for our magics.Warning the Cenarion Circle^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Ysiel Windsinger^Amythiel Mistwalker^Warning the Cenarion Circle^Drain Schematics^^Speak to Amythiel Mistwalker at Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^The Cenarion Expedition has become a large organization with a good degree of autonomy. These events are important enough that we need to warn the Cenarion Circle. Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to Moonglade; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula.A Demonstration of Loyalty^60^All^Paladin^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City wants you to destroy 3 Scourge Meat Wagons and kill 15 Scourge Siege Engineers.^We Blood Knights are bound to defend Quel'Thalas, <name>. This is a central part of your training. Our enemies are fierce and unrelenting. Silvermoon and its people remain free by our efforts and the support of our allies. I have received some disturbing reports of a renewed Scourge presence to the southeast of our border with the Eastern Plaguelands. A company of Scourge siege engineers and their equipment appear to be staging for an attack on the Ghostlands. They must not be permitted to succeed.Now That We're Friends...^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Gzhun'tt^Gzhun'tt^Now That We're Friends...^^^Kill 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses, and then return to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^The naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast have begun to kill our people. We cannot allow this to continue, <class>! We suggest that you teach them a lesson as proof of our friendship.Now That We're Still Friends...^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Gzhun'tt^Gzhun'tt^Now That We're Friends...^^^Kill 12 Bloodscale Slavedrivers and 6 Bloodscale Enchantresses, and then return to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^Reports have come in that the naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast continue to kill our people. We thought that you had dealt with this, <class>! I suggest that you to teach them a lesson as proof of our continued friendship.A Warm Welcome^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Warden Hamoot^Warden Hamoot^Warden Hamoot^^^Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge wants you to bring him 30 Naga Claws.^While the druids from the expedition have made themselves busy studying plants and researching the lakes, I've made it my business to deal with the hostiles in the area. Ever since we set foot in Zangarmarsh, the naga have launched lethal attacks against us without warning. We've done our best to keep them at bay, but our resources are limited. I want you to go to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and show them that we're not to be crossed. Bring me their claws as proof of your victories.Fhwoor Smash!^65^All^Zangarmarsh^Fhwoor^Gzhun'tt^^^^Escort Fhwoor into the area of the Marshlight steam pump to retrieve the Ark of Ssslith. Bring Fhwoor and the ark back safely and then report back to Gzhun'tt at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^Little naga make Fhwoor angry! Sporelings good friend to Fhwoor, so Fhwoor get naga ark. We go into nearby naga village. You help? Bring friends!Leader of the Darkcrest^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Wanted Poster^Warden Hamoot^^^^Slay Rajah Haghazed at the Lagoon and return to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Expedition in Zangarmarsh for a reward.^A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajah Haghazed, leader of the Darkcrest naga. Haghazed was last sighted by Cenarion scouts at the Lagoon, in the central southern region of Zangarmarsh. The Darkcrest have been linked to numerous attacks against the Cenarion Expedition and their leader is considered extremely dangerous. Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot.Drain Schematics^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Drain Schematics^Ysiel Windsinger^^^Warning the Cenarion Circle^Search Serpent Lake for signs of a drain. Return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge with news of your discovery.^The schematics you've obtained show an underground system of drains and pumps that connect the lakes in the region to Serpent Lake. If the schematics are correct, there is a giant drain in the center of Serpent Lake. Confirm this and bring the news to Cenarion Refuge.Return to the Marsh^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Amythiel Mistwalker^Ysiel Windsinger^Warning the Cenarion Circle^^Failed Incursion^Return to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Return to Ysiel and let her know that help will be extended to her as soon as it is possible. Affairs in Moonglade and Silithus have kept our members occupied, but we will do our best to send the necessary resources to the Cenarion Refuge.True Masters of the Light^60^Blood Elf^Paladin^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City wants you to bring him a vial of Tyr's Hand Holy Water.^A Blood Knight master possesses incredible skill at wielding and weaving the Light in a way that other so-called 'paladins' can never comprehend. It doesn't stop them from despising us for unleashing the Light's true potential. We must send them a message and show them that we are not to be trifled with. What I have in mind will be neither brief nor easy, but if you are committed, the first step will be to infiltrate the library wing of the Tyr's Hand Abbey and procure a vial of Tyr's Hand holy water.True Masters of the Light^60^Blood Elf^Paladin^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath in Silvermoon City wants you to bring him 1 Arcane Catalyst, 1 Crepuscular Powder, 1 Azerothian Diamond, and 1 Pristine Black Diamond.^Now that we have the water, we're going to need a number of reagents in precise quantities. Some of these substances are rare and expensive, <name>, but I have located sources for two. You should be able to purchase some arcane catalyst from Zalle, the reagent vendor in one of the shops on the plaza near the Dead Scar. Darlia, the poison merchant near the rogue trainers on Murder Row, stocks crepuscular powder. To complete my mixture, I'll also need an azerothian diamond and a pristine black diamond.True Masters of the Light^60^Blood Elf^Paladin^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^Lord Solanar Bloodwrath^A Summons from Lord Solanar^^^Use the Extinguishing Mixture near the eternal flame in the Alonsus Chapel to remove the Light's protection. Be prepared to fight anyone who may attempt to defend the chapel.^Ours is the true way of utilizing the Light, <name>. To show others that would call themselves 'paladins' the folly of their ways, I intend to send an unmistakable message. The Alonsus Chapel, where the Order of the Silver Hand was founded, seems immune to the destruction of Stratholme. The chapel's eternal flame affords it the Light's protection, but when you use this mixture to extinguish the flame, that protection will be no more. It will burn, and our dominion over the Light will be proven to the world.Lost in Action^65^All^Coilfang Reservoir^Watcher Jhang^Watcher Jhang^^Failed Incursion^^Discover what happened to Earthbinder Rayge, Naturalist Bite, Weeder Greenthumb, and Windcaller Claw. Then, return to Watcher Jhang at Coilfang Reservoir in Zangarmarsh.^You have to help me! We were sent here by Ysiel to investigate the mystery of the steam pumps and why they're being used to drain the water from the marsh. But my friends split up and went on recklessly without me. Those four can be such jerks sometimes, but I love them anyway. That is why I need you to discover what became of them, though I fear the worst. Seek them in both the Slave Pens and the Underbog. Thank you, <class>.The Sporelings' Plight^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Fahssn^Fahssn^^^More Spore Sacs^Fahssn at the Spawning Glen wants you to collect 10 Mature Spore Sacs.^You there! You must help us! The fungal giants are devouring all of our spore sacs! You must do something, or we'll lose our young! The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted. Look for the small, mature spore sacs and save as many of them as you can!The Sun Gate^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Aesom^Vindicator Aesom^Don't Drink the Water^^What We Know...^Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to destroy the Sun Gate.^Thanks to you and the work you did, my scouts were able to find the sun gate. The elves keep the portal location mobile so that they can move it at a moment's notice. That's why the site you investigated was empty. The strength of such a system is also its greatest weakness. The sun gate is stabilized by portal controllers. If we can take down the controllers, the portal will be ours to destroy. The current sun gate location can be found west of here, south of the Vector Coil. Find it and destroy it!Critters of the Void^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Scout Loryi^Vindicator Aesom^^^^Kill 12 Void Critters and report to Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch.^Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago. Needless to say, we found it... <Loryi points at Jorli.> Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done.Natural Enemies^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Fahssn^Fahssn^^^More Tendrils!^Fahssn at the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh wants you to bring him 6 Bog Lord Tendrils.^Us sporelings and the bog lords have never gotten along well. In the past, we've managed to keep them at bay with spears and stones. Lately they seem to have become more aggressive... or more desperate. They do not fear us or our weapons. You are much scarier and better armed than us. If you were to fight the boglords for us, we'd be forever in your debt! Bring me their tendrils so I know how many you've killed.Limits of Physical Exhaustion^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Aesom^Vindicator Aesom^Don't Drink the Water^^^Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to slay 10 Sunhawk Pyromancers and 10 Sunhawk Defenders.^Victory is close at hand, <name>. With the discovery of the sun gate, it won't be long until their supply lines are completely closed off. Now is the time to strike at their numbers. To the west you will find numerous Sunhawk camps. The Sunhawk pyromancers and defenders occupy the vast majority of the area. Find them, kill them and return to me.The Umbrafen Tribe^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Ikeyen^Ikeyen^The Umbrafen Tribe^^Safeguarding the Watchers, Saving the Sporeloks^Ikeyen at the Cenarion Refuge wants you to travel to Umbrafen Village and slay Kataru, 8 Umbrafen Seers, 6 Umbrafen Witchdoctors and 6 Umbrafen Oracles.^The naga are terrible, yes. But even more terrible are the traitor tribes of Broken and Lost Ones that helped them! The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the Umbrafen tribe; they use dark magic to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped slaves and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day. Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, Kataru. Until then I will fear for my life every single day.Don't Drink the Water^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Aesom^Vindicator Aesom^Don't Drink the Water^The Cryo-Core^^Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch wants you to use the Water Sample Flask to get a Bloodmyst Water Sample.^Our shaman claim that the elements of water have become greatly agitated by the pollution of the water source. We know that the Exodar's power core is lodged into the mountain to the west. It must be leaking volatile fluids into the water supply! I need you to get me more information. <Aesom points to a flask and nods.> You are to take this flask and follow the beach north until you reach the area where the rivers of Bloodmyst drain into the ocean. Take a sample from that location and return to me.The Bloodcurse Legacy^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Admiral Odesyus^Captain Edward Hanes^The Bloodcurse Legacy^Urgent Delivery^The Bloodcursed Naga^Admiral Odesyus has asked that you find and speak with Captain Edward Hanes.^Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago. This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of Blood Watch?Escape from Umbrafen^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Kayra Longmane^Ysiel Windsinger^^^^Escort Kayra Longmane to the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh. Report to Ysiel Windsinger when you've completed this task.^You must help me get out of here! I was gathering herbs nearby when a handful of these little savages abducted me. I tried to fight them off, but there were too many of them. Help me return to the Cenarion Refuge and away from these cruel wretches and their vile magic!What We Know...^20^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Aesom^Exarch Admetius^What We Know...^The Sun Gate^^Speak to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch.^We've learned much of our enemies in recent days. The blood elves are led by a being known as Sironas and plot to destroy us. Ultimately, they seek to enslave O'ros and regain control of the Exodar. Light be praised, we have stopped their supply line by destroying the sun gate. Unfortunately, they continue to use the contaminant of the Vector Coil to poison the land, using the mutagenic properties of the fallout to their advantage. With this knowledge, Admetius has devised a plan. Seek him out.What We Don't Know...^20^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Exarch Admetius^Exarch Admetius^What We Know...^^^Speak to a Captured Sunhawk Agent at Blood Watch and recover Sunhawk Information. Return to Exarch Admetius when the task is complete.^Our attempts at interrogation have failed miserably, <name>. Torture is - of course - out of the question. What we need is a draenei on the inside. I can cast a spell upon you that would make you appear blood elf and adjust your language. Through subterfuge, we may be able to get the information we need out of the captured agent. Under this guise, I want you to get whatever information you can out of the prisoner. And <name>, do not leave Blood Watch while disguised as the spell will fail.Seek Huntress Kella Nightbow^10^Draenei^Hunter^Thorgas Grimson^Huntress Kella Nightbow^Seek Huntress Kella Nightbow^^^Speak with Huntress Kella Nightbow near Valaar's Berth.^Huntress Kella Nightbow seeks the audience of all eligible hunters. She is the one to teach you the skill of taming wild beasts, a lesson you should learn above all else at this point in your training. Kella can be found near Valaar's Berth, the docks west of the Exodar.Return to Arcanist Vandril^10^Horde^Ghostlands^High Executor Mavren^Arcanist Vandril^The Forsaken^^Anok'suten^Return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.^Now my friend, if you would be so kind as to return to Arcanist Vandril, I know that he is very anxious to send you out on your first mission here in the Ghostlands. We're counting on you, <name>. Don't let us down.Ending Their World^20^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Demolitionist Legoso^Exarch Admetius^^Clearing the Way^The Unwritten Prophecy^Follow and protect Demolitionist Legoso as he attempts to destroy the Vector Coil and slay Sironas. Return to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch should you complete the mission.^Don't accept this assignment if you value your life. You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder? Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of Sunhawks while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition. Sironas the eredar is somewhere up there as well. I won't think less of you if you just walk away, <name>. But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas. Well, are you?Vindicator's Rest^20^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Exarch Admetius^Vindicator Corin^What We Know...^^^Speak with Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest on Bloodmyst Isle.^I would not ask you to single-handedly bear the burden of destroying the Vector Coil and slaying Sironas, <name>; however, I believe that you can be of some help in clearing the way for others that might take on such a dangerous assignment. Take the road going north out of Blood Watch and follow it until you get to the fork. Once there, take the left road and follow it until you see Vindicator's Rest - it will be slightly west of the road itself. Corin will be waiting for you.Clearing the Way^20^Draenei^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Corin^Vindicator Corin^What We Know...^^Ending Their World^Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest wants you to slay 8 Sunhawk Saboteurs and 8 Sunhawk Agents.^Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless of draenei will submit to Legoso's mission. The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching Sironas. He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide... <Corin sighs.> My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses. You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be.The Warlord's Hideout^70^All^The Steamvault^Watcher Jhang^Watcher Jhang^^^^Watcher Jhang wants you to find and slay Warlord Kalithresh inside Coilfang Reservoir.^There are benefits to hiding very, very quietly at the entrance of your enemy's hideout. Just hours ago I saw a group of naga go through the stone archway on the second tunnel from the left. I'm not well versed in their language, yet I clearly understood one word: Kalithresh. That must be the entrance to the steam vaults, where Warlord Kalithresh has been commanding his troops from. You must find him and stop him. I am too weak to be of any assistance.Orders from Lady Vashj^70^All^The Steamvault^Orders from Lady Vashj^Ysiel Windsinger^Orders from Lady Vashj^^^Deliver the Orders from Lady Vashj to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^This letter contains detailed orders to the Coilfang naga operating the steam vaults. It warns of the arrival of Cenarion druids into the region and orders them to be slain on sight. The rate of water redirection from other lakes into Coilfang Reservoir is to be doubled. The orders bear the seal of the infamous Lady Vashj. This letter would be of great interest to the druids of the Cenarion Expedition. Take it to their leader, Ysiel Windsinger.Preparing for War^70^All^The Steamvault^Ysiel Windsinger^Ysiel Windsinger^Orders from Lady Vashj^^Coilfang Armaments^Obtain Coilfang Armaments from naga at Coilfang Reservoir and return them to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^The Cenarion Expedition began as a peaceful venture, yet we now face the prospect of all out war with the naga. We have many among us who are willing to fight but are ill equipped. Bring me the naga's own weapons so that we may reforge them into glaives and arrowheads. Only the best armaments will have materials useful to us, <name>. You will have to seek out the naga of Coilfang Reservoir.There's No Explanation for Fashion^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Magasha^Magasha^^^^Bring 8 Diaphanous Wings from any species of Zangarmarsh fireflies to Magasha in Swamprat Post.^<Magasha chuckles softly to herself.> I bet if they knew they were wearing bug parts, the fashion trend would end very quickly. We first started killing the bugs 'round here 'cause they were getting in the way of our construction. Some enterprising merchant stops here, spends the night, and next thing you know he's buyin' up all the bug wings we have! Says he makes clothes out of 'em. I be stickin' to my armor, thanks. But if you gather the wings of any of the fireflies, I'll gladly buy 'em.Menacing Marshfangs^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Reavij^Reavij^Menacing Marshfangs^^Nothin' Says Lovin' Like a Big Stinger^Reavij at Swamprat Post wants you to kill 10 Marshfang Rippers.^Sometimes I wish Denjai had sent a shaman with us, or at least given us a totem to keep the marshfang rippers at bay. The whole place is crawling with the pests! It's just not right. Shouldn't something be eating these despicable things? We've all been taking turns playing exterminator. You showed up at just the right time, <name>. Congratulations! Now get out there and mop up some marshfangs!Searching for Scout Jyoba^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Zurai^Scout Jyoba^Thick Hydra Scales^^^Search for Scout Jyoba at the Dead Mire in Zangarmarsh.^Now that you're familiar with the terrain, I'd like to ask your help with something else. The Dead Mire, we've taken to calling the area to the northwest, is an eerie place. No one has ever reported seeing anything alive there, but they didn't stay for very long, either. Scout Jyoba volunteered to investigate the area and report on his findings. He left the post three days ago and hasn't returned. It's not like him to be gone that long without sending some kind of report. Will you search for him, <name>?Jyoba's Report^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Scout Jyoba^Zurai^Thick Hydra Scales^^^Retrieve Scout Jyoba's Report from the Withered Giants and return it to Zurai at Swamprat Post.^Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of Scout Jyoba. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the Dead Mire. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report. Without the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the scout discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to Zurai.No More Mushrooms!^61^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Magasha^Magasha^^^^Gather 8 Eel Filets from Umbrafen Eels and bring them to Magasha at Swamprat Post.^Mushroom soup, mushroom stew, mushroom sauce! Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom! It's all there is to eat around here. If you say you're hungry, the cook hands you an axe and tells you to go chop down your dinner! Well, I'm tired of mushrooms. I've seen fish in the lakes around here. Sure, they look like a nasty piece of work, but they've got to be better than mushrooms! How much will it cost me to hire you to bring me my first decent meal in weeks?Thick Hydra Scales^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Zurai^Zurai^Thick Hydra Scales^^Searching for Scout Jyoba^Zurai at Swamprat Post wants you to bring him 12 Thick Hydra Scales.^Reavij was wise to bring leather armor. This swamp will render my mail useless before long. I've been replacing the scales bit by bit as I'm able. The hydra in the marsh have thick, protective scales that stand up well to the dampness of their home. Finding suitable ones is a tedious process, though. All too often, the best scales are torn or worn too thin for use in armor. Bring me any good ones that you might get from the hydra in the larger lakes.Report to Shadow Hunter Denjai^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Zurai^Shadow Hunter Denjai^^^^Bring Zurai's Report to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin in Zangarmarsh.^Shadow Hunter Denjai will no doubt expect to receive a report about my progress in establishing our outpost. I've prepared a short summary of what we've accomplished here already, but with the loss of Scout Jyoba, I can't spare a runner to take the report to Denjai's base of Zabra'jin to the west. If you're headed that way, would you mind bringing this to him? Shadow Hunter Denjai can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get used to him, he's not so bad.The Orebor Harborage^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Anchorite Ahuurn^Ikuti^^^^Speak to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage in Zangarmarsh.^As you know, many of Telredor's inhabitants are refugees from the war that decimated the draenei. It is my goal to maintain Telredor as a safe haven for all of our allies in this struggle. There are some who desire to join us, but feel they are not yet ready. We owe them whatever help we can provide, <name>. A group of Broken under the leadership of Ikuti have taken shelter in the ruins of an old temple to the northwest of Serpent Lake. Seek them out and extend your hand in friendship to them.Fulgor Spores^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Ruam^Ruam^^^^Bring 6 Fulgor Spores to Ruam at Telredor.^There is little in this swamp that will burn, <race>, so we must resort to other means for lighting Telredor. Many of the creatures and plants in the marsh emit a soft glow. It's difficult and cruel to confine the glowing creatures, so we've turned to a species of mushroom for our light source. We pick and cultivate the fulgor mushroom here, but our needs require us to gather new crops occasionally. The small green mushrooms often grow at the base of larger ones near Telredor.Warden Hamoot^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Ysiel Windsinger^Warden Hamoot^Warden Hamoot^^^Report to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Before you leave Cenarion Refuge, make sure you speak with Warden Hamoot. He's in charge of the expedition's security. He would never forgive me if I didn't send a seasoned adventurer like you his way.Intercepting the Message^16^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Boros^Vindicator Boros^Intercepting the Message^Blood Watch^^Kill Sunhawk elves until you find the Sunhawk Missive, then return it to Vindicator Boros at Blood Watch.^It is good to see you again, <name>. I have a quandary that you might be able to solve. Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document. Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion.Umbrafen Eel Filets^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Noraani^Noraani^Menacing Marshfangs^^^Noraani at Telredor wants you to bring her 8 Eel Filets.^It's good to see another fresh face here. When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago. Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others. If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet.Too Many Mouths to Feed^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Haalrun^Haalrun^Too Many Mouths to Feed^^Diaphanous Wings^Kill 10 Mire Hydra and return to Haalrun at Telredor.^On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a group of trolls. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too. If they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food. For each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed!The Dead Mire^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Vindicator Idaar^Vindicator Idaar^The Dead Mire^^^Bring a Dead Mire Soil Sample to Vindicator Idaar at Telredor.^I have lived among the anchorites of Telredor for some time, <name>, and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast. Virtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery.An Unnatural Drought^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Vindicator Idaar^Vindicator Idaar^The Dead Mire^^^Vindicator Idaar at Telredor wants you to kill 12 Withered Giants.^The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, <name>. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly. I've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path. These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering.Blessings of the Ancients^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Windcaller Blackhoof^Windcaller Blackhoof^^^^Windcaller Blackhoof wants you to speak to the ancients Ashyen and Keleth at Cenarion Refuge and obtain their blessings.^You've earned the trust of the Cenarion Expedition, <name>. It is time you spoke to the ancients allied with our cause, Ashyen and Keleth, and asked for their blessing. Carrying the mark of an ancient will fill you with great power. These boons will become more powerful as your renown among us increases. Go, <name>, and ask the ancients for their blessing.The Boha'mu Ruins^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Anchorite Ahuurn^Anchorite Ahuurn^The Boha'mu Ruins^^^Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to explore the Boha'mu Ruins.^Before my people were decimated by the orcs, Telredor served as a retreat for draenei anchorites and spiritualists. A small order of anchorites and vindicators maintained a number of shrines in this region. During the war, we lost contact with the anchorites assigned to the shrines, particularly the Boha'mu temple to the southwest. I've heard reports that a tribe of Lost Ones has settled in the area and may even be using the ruins. Visit the Boha'mu Ruins and tell me of what you find there.Idols of the Feralfen^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Anchorite Ahuurn^Anchorite Ahuurn^The Boha'mu Ruins^^^Gather 6 Feralfen Idols and return them to Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor.^From what you've told me about your observations at the Boha'mu Ruins, it seems this tribe of Lost Ones has reverted to the worship of animal spirits. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs. Return to Feralfen Village and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, <name>, as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them.A Damp, Dark Place^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Ikeyen^Ikeyen^The Umbrafen Tribe^^^Look for Ikeyen's Belongings inside a cave south of Umbrafen. Return them to Ikeyen at Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Soon after I escaped the Umbrafen tribe, I holed up in a cave south of their village. Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men! I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions. After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after. If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items. What do you say, <name>?Clefthoof Mastery^66^All^Nagrand^Hemet Nesingwary^Hemet Nesingwary^Clefthoof Mastery^^^Hunt down 12 Clefthoof and return to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Safari in Nagrand to prove yourself.^You want to earn a place in this safari? You'll have to prove yourself. I don't care what you've hunted before, you haven't hunted until you hunt what we hunt here. Start with the clefthoof if you're <man /tough> enough. I know that I've seen them in the immediate area around the safari and also close by to the south.Diaphanous Wings^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Haalrun^Haalrun^Too Many Mouths to Feed^^^Haalrun at Telredor wants you to bring him 8 Diaphanous Wings from any of the firefly species in Zangarmarsh.^Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first. I've found that the wings of the umbraglow stingers are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible. <Haalrun chuckles.> I see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings?Menacing Marshfangs^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Noraani^Noraani^Menacing Marshfangs^^^Kill 10 Marshfang Rippers and return to Noraani at Telredor.^During the orcs' war against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but the marsh is no less perilous. It seems that the nether rays have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone.A Message to Telaar^64^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Ikuti^Nahuud^^^^Speak with Nahuud at Telaar in Nagrand.^You've been honorable in our dealings, <name>, at a time when trust is hard to win among my people. A large group of my brethren have made their home in the old draenei city of Telaar in Nagrand, to the south. To reach Telaar, take the road south into Nagrand, then continue southeast until you find yourself in the cliffs east of Oshu'gun. Anyone who has aided us, as you have, would be welcome among the people of Telaar. Seek out Nahuud and tell him you have earned my trust.The Fate of Tuurem^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Vindicator Idaar^Andarl^^^^Take Vindicator Idaar's Letter to Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^Prophet Velen's search for allies has emboldened those draenei remaining in Outland to begin a search of their own. The Legion's war on my people drove us from our cities and temples, but they have not destroyed the traces of our civilization. Tuurem, my former home in the Terokkar Forest, was one of the first cities overrun by the orcs. It's been too long since I've received news of its status. Take this letter to Andarl in the Allerian Stronghold within Terokkar and see what you can find out.No Time for Curiosity^65^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Timothy Daniels^Kialon Nightblade^^^^Deliver Timothy's Letter to Kialon at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^<name>, I have a favor to ask of you. Normally, I would do this myself, but my hands are already beyond full. I have an associate named Kialon at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains to the north. He's expecting to hear from me in the near future, although I suspect he won't like what I have to say. If you would deliver my response to him, you would have my gratitude. I must insist, and this is very important, that you not attempt to read the letter. It is for Kialon's eyes alone.The Ogre Threat^65^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Shadow Hunter Denjai^Nekthar^^^^Travel to Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains and speak with Nekthar.^As if the naga and their allies weren't enough, the ogres are extending their reach in the marsh. They've already conquered most of the area to the northwest and there isn't much of a buffer left. For each one we kill, several more take their place. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold Zabra'jin once they decide to attack. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Nekthar know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome.News from Zangarmarsh^62^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Zurai^Mokasa^^^^Speak with Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^Shadow Hunter Denjai isn't the only one expecting a report from me. Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar is eager to hear of our progress, especially since most of her messengers travel through here. She asked me to send word once Swamprat Post was completed. If you wouldn't mind delivering the news, I'd be very grateful. We may be up and running, but there is still much to be done. To get to Stonebreaker Hold, follow the road south out of Zangarmarsh, into Terokkar Forest and beyond Tuurem.Reinforcements for Garadar^64^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Messenger Gazgrigg^Captain Kroghan^^^^Speak with Captain Kroghan at Garadar in Nagrand.^<Still catching his breath, the messenger gestures for you to sit.> They may not survive, <race>! Get to Garadar as quickly as your legs will carry you. <In response to your blank stare, the messenger elaborates.> The home of the Mag'har, lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of the marsh, then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake. Find our commander, Captain Kroghan, there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall!Blood Elf Plans^5^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Blood Elf Plans^Vindicator Aldar^^^^Take the Blood Elf Plans to Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^These plans seem important. You should take them to Vindicator Aldar at the crash site.Botanical Legwork^3^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Apprentice Vishael^Apprentice Vishael^^Volatile Mutations^^Gather 3 Corrupted Flowers and return them to Apprentice Vishael at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^The Ammen Fields to the west are the primary breeding ground of the local lasher population. With the corruption of the water table from the nearby lake, Botanist Taerix is worried that the lashers will not be able to repopulate themselves once we've cleansed the lake. Go to the Ammen Fields and pick some of the corrupted flowers for me so that I might take a look at them and see what can be done. You should be able to identify them by their uncharacteristic red petals.A Rare Bean^65^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Lo'ap^Elementalist Lo'ap^A Rare Bean^^^Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to bring him 8 Digested Caracoli.^You are ill-equipped to face the restless elements of Nagrand. Before you can help the Earthen Ring, you must help yourself. To the west you will find dung heaps left behind by the wildlife of Nagrand. You must search the dung for the digested remnants of the Nagrand caracoli. From this bean I am able to make a tablet that will aid you in your battle against the restless forces of nature. Return to me when you have collected no less than two fists worth of caracoli... Ogre sized fists.Gathering the Reagents^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Anchorite Ahuurn^Anchorite Ahuurn^The Boha'mu Ruins^^^Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor wants you to bring him 4 Sporebat Eyes and 4 Fen Strider Tentacles.^I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei, but would welcome an arakkoa. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered. You will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor.Plants of Zangarmarsh^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Lauranna Thar'well^Lauranna Thar'well^^^Identify Plant Parts^Bring 10 Unidentified Plant Parts to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water. We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct. As the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them. If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts. They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them.Messenger to the Feralfen^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Anchorite Ahuurn^Anchorite Ahuurn^The Boha'mu Ruins^^^Drink Ahuurn's Elixir while standing in the Boha'mu Ruins. Speak to Elder Kuruti while you are in the form of an arakkoa.^The time has come for us to embrace the Feralfen and teach them that the Light has not forsaken them. Take the potion I've prepared and carry it with you to the Boha'mu Ruins. Once you arrive at the ruins, drink the potion to assume the form of one of their bird spirits. Speak with Elder Kuruti and let him know the draenei are ready to welcome his people as our long lost brothers.Agitated Spirits of Skysong^65^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Lo'ap^Elementalist Lo'ap^A Rare Bean^^^Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to destroy 8 Lake Spirits.^The disturbance in the ebb and flow of the waters of Nagrand has greatly agitated the water spirits of Skysong Lake. They have in turn begun sowing destruction throughout the waterways of the area. Watoosun of the Water has come to us in a vision and granted us permission to remedy the problem - so long as the source of the disturbance is also dealt with... We will get to the source, but first you must deal with the problems immediate to the Throne. Destroy the agitated lake spirits and return to me.Blessing of Incineratus^65^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Lo'ap^Elementalist Lo'ap^A Rare Bean^^^Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to destroy the Large Hut, the Western Hut, the Southern Hut and the Eastern Hut at Windyreed Village.^The wretched Lost Ones, heretofore banished to the swamps of Zangarmarsh, are seeking to spread their filth to other parts of our world. I have sought the wisdom of the furies and gained their blessing. To stop the source, we must unleash the elements upon them! I give you living fire, plucked from the fiery essence of Incineratus himself. Travel to Windyreed Village, southeast of here, and unleash the living fire upon their huts! Let them see the fury of the elements!Fertile Spores^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Gshaff^Gshaff^^^More Fertile Spores^Gshaff wants you to gather 6 Fertile Spores from the various Zangarmarsh Spore Bats and Marsh Walkers. Return to Ghsaff at Sporeggar when you've completed this task.^Spore bats and marsh walkers accumulate fertile spores on their appendages from wandering around the tallstalk mushrooms in the marsh. As you can see, we're a short people so our options for gathering these spores are limited. Seek out the spore bats and marsh walkers and gather the fertile spores. All of Sporeggar will be in your debt.Glowcap Mushrooms^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Msshi'fn^Msshi'fn^^^More Glowcaps^Bring 10 Glowcaps to Msshi'fn at Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh.^I've seen your kind use shiny round pieces of metal to trade for things that you need. We're not so different from you. We use shiny round mushrooms as our currency. Glowcap mushrooms grow everywhere in the marsh, you just have to know how to pick them from the ground without wrecking them. I'll teach you how to do it, if you promise to bring us some for our reserves. What do you say, <name>?The Spirit Polluted^66^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Lo'ap^Elementalist Lo'ap^A Rare Bean^^^Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to destroy Watoosun's Polluted Essence and 8 Lake Surgers.^Watoosun was able to shed the stink of corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. A spirit essence composed of the vilest corruption found amongst the elements! You will find this polluted spirit of the swamp southwest of here, hidden in the depths of Lake Sunspring. Find and destroy the polluted essence of Watoosun and any corrupt offspring that it may have created.Friend of the Sin'dorei^21^Orc, Undead,^Ghostlands^Magister Kaendris^Lor'themar Theron^Friend of the Sin'dorei^The Traitor's Destruction^^Take Dar'Khan's Head to Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.^This is the beginning of a new chapter in blood elf history, <name>. You've helped cement the bond between my race and yours, <race>. Take the traitor's head to Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City. He'll be eager to hear the news.Envoy to the Horde^21^Orc, Undead,^Undercity^Lor'themar Theron^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Friend of the Sin'dorei^^^Bring the Letter from Lor'themar Theron to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in Undercity, the Forsaken capital in Tirisfal Glades.^There were doubts about our capabilities among our potential new allies. Of what use could we be to them when perceived as unable to deal with our problems at home? This changes everything. No longer will our power be questioned. We'll be able to join the Horde as equals. Take this letter to Sylvanas, ruler of the Forsaken. She's already on our side but the news of Dar'Khan's death will be music to her ears. Prepare for a long trip, <name>. If all goes well she will send you to Orgrimmar.Meeting the Warchief^21^Orc, Undead,^Orgrimmar^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Thrall^Friend of the Sin'dorei^^^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner wants you to take the Letter Sealed by Sylvanas to Thrall in Orgrimmar, capital of Durotar.^I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know. I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table. This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Thrall in Orgrimmar. As leader of the Horde he will have the final say on accepting the sin'dorei's pledge. I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Witch Doctor Tor'gash^Witch Doctor Tor'gash^Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!^^^Bring Witch Doctor Tor'gash 6 Burstcap Mushrooms.^You like mushrooms, mon? There be a powerful one here in Zangarmarsh, growin' real close to Zabra'jin. You gotta be careful, though, mon. They be callin' it the burstcap for a reason. If you be gettin' too close without takin' the proper precautions, it'll blow right up on you! Poof! Right into a cloud o' toxic spores. I been usin' them for readin' the omens, but they be almost gone now.Muck Diving^66^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Lo'ap^Elementalist Lo'ap^^^^Elementalist Lo'ap at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to retrieve 5 Muck-ridden Cores.^The most affected elements of water can be found in the Halaani Basin, southwest of here, beneath the abandoned city of Halaa. While some distressed elements can be destroyed without any impact upon the environment, spawns of muck must be physically removed from the world once destroyed. You see, muck spawns leave behind globules of tainted debris that if left untouched will spread and further contaminate the environment. Destroy these muck spawns and bring back their muck-ridden cores.Have You Ever Seen One of These?^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Witch Doctor Tor'gash^Witch Doctor Tor'gash^Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon!^^^Take the Murloc Cage and place it on the flat rock near Daggerfen Village.^This marsh be missin' one thing, mon! There be no murlocs here. Don't worry, mon, I got a plan to fix the problem. See Gargle 'n' Gurgle over there? I plan to give the gift o' murlocs to the Lost Ones! Take this cage with you to Daggerfen Village an' release 'em in the northeastern cluster of huts. Now you know I can't be riskin' Gargle 'n' Gurgle with you, but I'll give you a cage full o' colorful young murlocs. Just set it on the flat rock you be findin' up there and open the door!Leader of the Bloodscale^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Wanted Poster^Warden Hamoot^^^^Slay Rajis Fyashe at Serpent Lake and return to Warden Hamoot at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh for a reward.^A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajis Fyashe, leader of the Bloodscale naga. The naga sorceress was last sighted at Serpent Lake, in the northern region of Zangarmarsh. The Bloodscale are to be considered extremely dangerous and their leader is to be approached with extreme caution. Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot at Cenarion Refuge.The Underneath^65^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Untrag^Gordawg^The Underneath^^^Communicate with Gordawg.^Something rails the underneath. It beats the ground as if to punish. *Thud* <Untrag beats his chest with his fist.> It makes this sound a hundred-thousand times. Endlessly it beats. The earth reels. It is calling out to us now. Gordawg speaks to me. Gordawg knows that something forces the elements out. Something from the underneath. Go now and speak to Gordawg. No, listen to Gordawg, do not speak. Hear Gordawg...The Tortured Earth^65^All^Nagrand^Gordawg^Gordawg^The Underneath^^^Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you destroy 10 Tortured Earth Spirits.^Bring up the usurper. You will find him. Follow earthen path. First you put to rest tortured earth spirits. Must sleep once more. <Gordawg smashes his fist into the ground and brings up very foul smelling soil.> Must sleep! <Gordawg points southeast.> Find spirits near mountains. Near hills. Near rocks. Near earth. Put to sleep. Telaari Basin... Southeast.WANTED: Boss Grog'ak^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Wanted Poster^Shadow Hunter Denjai^WANTED: Boss Grog'ak^^^Bring Boss Grog'ak's Head to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin.^Wanted - Dead or Alive: Boss Grog'ak, overseer of the Ango'rosh mushroom-cutting operation. This brute and his axe-wielding cronies are responsible for chopping down the mushrooms to the north of town. Unless he is stopped, he and his band will cut a path to the walls of Zabra'jin. <He/She> who presents the head of Boss Grog'ak to Shadow Hunter Denjai shall be well-rewarded.Eating Damnation^66^All^Nagrand^Gordawg^Gordawg^The Underneath^^^Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you bring him 10 Enraged Crusher Cores.^<Gordawg picks up a rock and begins to chew on it.> Gordawg tastes. Gordawg knows where this earth has been. <Gordawg raises one of his massive legs and stomps the ground.> Look. See Nagrand. <Gordawg directs you to the imprint of his foot. Within the imprint you see what appears to be a perfect geological map of Nagrand, marked with the locations of where you can find the elementals Gordawg wants you to destroy.> BREAK THEM! Bring Gordawg the pieces to eat. Take the map.Impending Attack^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Shadow Hunter Denjai^Shadow Hunter Denjai^WANTED: Boss Grog'ak^^Message to the Daggerfen^Bring the Ango'rosh Attack Plans to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin.^The position of the ogres' mushroom-cutting operation can't be an accident. I can't escape the suspicion that they're preparing for an attack on Zabra'jin. I must know for certain, <name>. The ogres have another outpost to the northwest, the Ango'rosh Grounds. If they're staging for an attack, there will be evidence of their plans there. Go there, <name> and search the camp for signs of their intentions. Return to me with anything that might be suspicious.Us or Them^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Shadow Hunter Denjai^Shadow Hunter Denjai^WANTED: Boss Grog'ak^^^Kill Overlord Gorefist, 10 Ango'rosh Maulers, and 10 Ango'rosh Souleaters and report back to Shadow Hunter Denjai in Zabra'jin.^In order to end the Ango'rosh threat, we must kill their leader, Overlord Gorefist. We'll do better than that, though. We'll make an example of the overlord and his followers. Go to the Ango'rosh Stronghold and deal with our foes. The stronghold is located in a cave on a small island to the northwest of Zabra'jin. You'll see a bridge made from a fallen mushroom beyond the Ango'rosh Camp. Show no mercy, <name>. They certainly wouldn't spare any of us.Arcane Disturbances^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Archmage Alturus^Archmage Alturus^^^Contact from Dalaran^Use the Violet Scrying Crystal near underground sources of water in the Master's Cellar and return to Archmage Alturus outside of Karazhan.^I'm trying to obtain an imprint of Karazhan's energy... for a personal project, of course. Unfortunately, I'm not getting anything up here. If I could get near an underground water source, my crystal would pick up the signals much more clearly. I've heard of an underground pond as well as a well in a cellar below us. This whole place is crawling with ghosts however, and venturing there would be hazardous for someone my age. What do you say; will you help an old man and perform the scrying for me?Restless Activity^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Archmage Alturus^Archmage Alturus^^^Contact from Dalaran^Bring 10 Ghostly Essences to Archmage Alturus outside of Karazhan.^As you may have noticed, the outside of Karazhan is crawling with ghostly beings. The reason for their existence is unknown and unknowns bother me! Bring me their ghostly essence so that I may study their nature. Karazhan has many secrets, <name>. I'm determined to uncover all of them.Contact from Dalaran^70^All^Dalaran Crater^Archmage Alturus^Archmage Cedric^Contact from Dalaran^Arcane Disturbances, Restless Activity^^Bring Alturus's Report to Archmage Cedric in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater.^These signs do not bode well for us, <name>. I've never been one for secrecy so I will tell you a bit about my organization, the Violet Eye. We are agents of the Kirin Tor, the Magus Senate of Dalaran. We were assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and Medivh, in case things got out of hand. Which they did... very quickly, after Medivh disappeared. This report details my findings. Take it to Archmage Cedric, also from the Violet Eye; you will find him in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater.Withered Basidium^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Withered Basidium^Ruam^Withered Basidium^^^Take the Withered Basidium to Ruam in Telredor in Zangarmarsh.^A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform. Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium.Withered Basidium^62^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Withered Basidium^Reavij^^^^Bring the Withered Basidium to Reavij at Swamprat Post in Zangarmarsh.^A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform. Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium.Khadgar^70^All^Shattrath City^Archmage Cedric^Khadgar^Contact from Dalaran^^^Deliver Alturus's Report to Khadgar in Shattrath City in Terokkar Forest.^Alturus's report is unsettling. We thought it was bad when Karazhan sealed itself off to the outside world. We had agents inside; we never heard from any of them again. Now this... demonic emanation. We must investigate it. The only people who can reopen Karazhan were presumed dead: Khadgar and Medivh. While we hope that the latter is indeed gone, we recently learned that his apprentice, Khadgar, is alive and well in a place called Shattrath City. Find him and give him Alturus's report.Stinger Venom^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Puluu^Puluu^^^^Bring 6 Marshlight Bleeder Venom to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage.^When I speak to draenei, I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the Broken, who they say have lost something. We Broken may have lost our inclination toward the Light, but our experiences have brought us closer to the land. My people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing.Entry Into Karazhan^70^All^Shadow Labyrinth^Khadgar^Khadgar^Contact from Dalaran^^^Khadgar wants you to enter the Shadow Labyrinth at Auchindoun and retrieve the First Key Fragment from an Arcane Container hidden there.^I am deeply troubled by the news in this report, <name>. Gaining entry into Karazhan will be difficult, however. You see, when it became apparent that I was stranded here I split the key into three fragments. I placed the keys inside enchanted containers, and in turn placed those in places that were safe at the time. With the dark changes Outland has endured this no longer is the case. The first fragment is in a section of Auchindoun taken over by the Shadow Council. Return this fragment to me.The Second and Third Fragments^70^All^Shattrath City^Khadgar^Khadgar^Contact from Dalaran^^The Master's Touch^Obtain the Second Key Fragment from an Arcane Container inside Coilfang Reservoir and the Third Key Fragment from an Arcane Container inside Tempest Keep. Return to Khadgar in Shattrath City after you've completed this task.^I hid the second fragment at the bottom of Serpent Lake, long before it was called that. The giant drain installed there after the naga took over has likely pulled the container into the depths of Coilfang Reservoir. The third fragment will prove the most trying, as I left it inside Tempest Keep back when it was controlled by the naaru. Kael'thas now rules it and the chamber where I left it has become a prison. Bring me these remaining fragments, <name>. Much depends on your success.Lines of Communication^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Puluu^Puluu^^^^Puluu at the Orebor Harborage wants you to kill 12 Marshfang Slicers.^One of the reasons Ikuti led us to Zangarmarsh was to help open the lines of communication between the draenei and the Kurenai home city of Telaar in Nagrand. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads must be secured. On our way here, we were attacked repeatedly by marshfang slicers. We were able to fight them off, but they would pose a formidable threat to a solitary messenger. Reducing their numbers will help ensure the safety of our messengers.Natural Armor^64^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Maktu^Maktu^Natural Armor^^^Bring 8 Fenclaw Hides to Maktu at the Orebor Harborage.^Maktu can always see a draenei approaching in his shiny armor from a mile away, even in this murky swamp! Maktu wants to laugh at them, but then he remembers that they have been kind to the Kurenai and he wants to teach them about how Kurenai make armor. The dark, scaly hides of the fenclaw thrashers make some of the best armor Maktu has ever worn. If <name> can bring Maktu some of these hides from the fenclaw thrashers deep in Serpent Lake, he'll be happy to share some of his armor.Ango'rosh Encroachment^64^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Ikuti^Ikuti^Ango'rosh Encroachment^^^Kill 10 Ango'rosh Ogres and 5 Ango'rosh Shaman and return to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage.^The small band of Broken you see here is a mission from a larger settlement in Nagrand. The Kurenai, as we call ourselves, are Broken who desire to reunite with our draenei brothers. My group has come here to strengthen Kurenai ties to the draenei of Telredor. If the Ango'rosh ogres have their way, this temple will not stand much longer. They have cleared the Hewn Bog of its towering mushrooms and draw ever closer to our refuge. If you would call yourself our friend, aid us in fighting this enemy.The Master's Touch^70^All^Caverns of Time^Khadgar^Medivh^The Master's Touch^The Second and Third Fragments^^Go into the Caverns of Time and convince Medivh to enable your Restored Apprentice's Key.^I've put together the very key I used as an apprentice. It looks completely functional as far as keys go. In regards to opening Karazhan, however, this might as well be a piece of scrap metal. Without Medivh's consent, the key is worthless. Yes, of course I know Medivh is dead. This merely makes things difficult, not impossible. There is a place in Azeroth called the Caverns of Time, guarded by the bronze dragonflight. Find a way inside, travel back in time and get Medivh to enable the key.Return to Khadgar^70^All^Shattrath City^Medivh^Khadgar^The Master's Touch^^^Return to Khadgar in Shattrath City and show him the Master's Key.^I seem to have memories about future events surrounding you and this key. <Medivh looks at you like he's just seen a ghost.> You have trying times ahead of you, <name>. Let us hope your strength does not fail you. Regarding the key, I am to hand it to Khadgar when he's sent to me. I couldn't hope for a better apprentice. I suppose you will need a key of your own. <Medivh reaches into his robe and hands you his own key.> Go on then. And best of luck, <class>.The Violet Eye^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Khadgar^Archmage Alturus^The Master's Touch^^^Speak to Archmage Alturus outside Karazhan.^A great responsibility has been bestowed upon you, <name>. If the signs that the Violet Eye has observed are to be trusted, then you must help them. For all my disagreements with Cedric, the work that men like Alturus do is still important. Beware that they do not use you, however. Remember it is you who the key is bound to, not them. But if the danger in Karazhan is real, then it is they who are best prepared to guide you in dealing with it. Go back to Alturus and help him in any way that you can.Overlord Gorefist^64^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Ikuti^Ikuti^Ango'rosh Encroachment^^^Ikuti wants you to kill Overlord Gorefist and 10 Ango'rosh Maulers. Return to the Orebor Harborage once you have completed the task.^The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next. Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom. Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite.Assessing the Situation^70^All^The Violet Eye^Archmage Alturus^Koren^The Master's Touch^^^Find Koren inside Karazhan.^Now that we've found a way back into Medivh's Tower - or rather you have - the first thing we need to do is try to get a sense of what the situation inside is. One of our agents who had managed to infiltrate Karazhan kept an encoded log of her observations. Unfortunately her death was confirmed shortly before Karazhan was shut down. Koren, Karazhan's blacksmith, was under our pay. Though not a member of the Violet Eye, he should be able to help us find Keanna's log. Look for him inside.Stinging the Stingers^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Gambarinka^Gambarinka^Stinging the Stingers^^^Kill 8 Marshlight Bleeders and return to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin.^It's impossible to work with all this infernal buzzing! Do you hear it? I can't get it out of my head! I know exactly what's making the noise, too. It's those damnable marshlight bleeders! The noise always comes from the south and west of the village. They're too big to swat, crush underfoot, or wave away. The only way to stop that unholy droning is to kill them. I don't care how you do it, <name>, just quiet them!The Sharpest Blades^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Gambarinka^Gambarinka^Stinging the Stingers^^^Bring 10 Marshfang Slicer Blades to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin.^The damp atmosphere of the marsh has taken a toll on my metal tools. It's made woodworking a lot more difficult than it ought to be, so I've given up on metal blades. It turns out that the marshfang slicers living to the south and west of town grow blades that are sharper than any steel I've ever owned. They're also resistant to rust and wear. It's just a little tricky to attach them to a handle, but I think I've got it figured out. I'd appreciate any blades you could bring me.Keanna's Log^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Koren^Archmage Alturus^The Master's Touch^^^Search the Guest Chambers inside Karazhan for Keanna's Log and bring it to Archmage Alturus outside Karazhan.^Who did you say you were looking for again? Keanna? I once met someone with that name. She was staying up at the guest chambers. I was supposed to keep that a secret now, wasn't I? Did you say you were with the Violet Eye? No, I've never heard of them. I need to return to my work now, if you don't mind. <Koren seems to have forgotten about you already.>A Demonic Presence^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Archmage Alturus^Archmage Alturus^The Master's Touch^^^Archmage Alturus wants you to destroy the Demonic Presence at the top of Karazhan.^Keanna's last few entries confirm our suspicions of a demonic presence inside Karazhan. She detected the arrival of a Burning Legion agent whose location she describes as coming from the top of the tower. Her entries stop there. Karazhan is a very important place, <class>. It is a portal into the nether, a beacon shining into other worlds. The possible repercussions of it falling into the wrong hands are unthinkable. This demonic intrusion must be stopped. And you, <name>, are the only one with a key.Angling to Beat the Competition^64^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Zurjaya^Zurjaya^Angling to Beat the Competition^^Pursuing Terrorclaw^Kill 10 Fenclaw Thrashers and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin.^It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in Outland. Now I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in Serpent Lake. Not only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything!Spirits of the Feralfen^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Seer Janidi^Seer Janidi^Spirits of the Feralfen^^^Bring 10 Feralfen Protection Totems to Seer Janidi at Zabra'jin.^The most powerful tribe of Lost Ones in the marsh, the Feralfen, are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the spirits of this world cannot be ignored. Find the Feralfen mystics, hunters and druids, <name>, and capture their totems. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings.A Spirit Ally?^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Seer Janidi^Seer Janidi^Spirits of the Feralfen^^^Take the Feralfen Totem to the foot of the stairs at the Boha'mu Ruins and plant it in the ground. Report your findings to Seer Janidi at Zabra'jin.^We must find out how much power this Feralfen snake spirit possesses and whether it can be bent to our will. Imagine what I could do with the powers of an Outland spirit at my command! Take this totem with you and make your way to the foot of the stairs leading to the Boha'mu Ruins. Plant the totem in the ground and it should do the rest. The spirit should not be able to tell who has used the totem until it has manifested.Secrets of the Daggerfen^64^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Timothy Daniels^Timothy Daniels^^^^Bring the Daggerfen Poison Manual and a Daggerfen Poison Vial to Timothy Daniels at the Orebor Harborage.^Bugs, bugs, bugs! The marsh is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them. Well, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a village of Lost Ones who call themselves the Daggerfen. The whole tribe consists of highly specialized assassins. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial.Shattering the Veil^67^All^Nagrand^Gordawg^Gordawg^The Underneath^^^Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you slay 30 Minions of Gurok.^<Gordawg breaks off a piece of ebon rock from his back.> You are granted a piece of the fury of the earth. Take the boulder of Gordawg and hurl it at the poison rock. Shatter their shells to discover the truth. Destroy the minions of the usurper and return to Gordawg with the name. You find the shattered elements at the edge of the world. Southwest.Clefthoof Mastery^67^All^Nagrand^Hemet Nesingwary^Hemet Nesingwary^Clefthoof Mastery^^^Kill 12 Clefthoof Bulls and then speak to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Safari in Nagrand about your prowess.^You've proved to me that you can find and take down a regular clefthoof, but far more dangerous are the clefthoof bulls. Bag yourself twelve of those. Then you can talk to me of your hunting prowess. Look for them all along the middle region of Nagrand to the west and south.Clefthoof Mastery^67^All^Nagrand^Hemet Nesingwary^Hemet Nesingwary^Clefthoof Mastery^^The Ultimate Bloodsport^Acquire the Horn of Banthar and return it to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^Banthar is the fiercest and most elusive of all the clefthoof in Outland. She's also the hairiest. It is said that she roams with her clefthoof herd in the Field of Spirits near Oshu'gun. You want to truly prove your hunting mastery? Bring me her horn!The Ultimate Bloodsport^68^All^Nagrand^Hemet Nesingwary^Hemet Nesingwary^^Clefthoof Mastery^^Bring the Heart of Tusker to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Safari in Nagrand.^The queen of all that dwell in Nagrand is known as Tusker. She's a giant elekk the likes of which you won't see anywhere else! You're right to be fearful of that name. Bach'lor, Gutripper, and Banthar are nothing when compared to her. It is said that she can be found on a huge bluff far to the southwest overlooking Oshu'gun. Bring me her massive heart if you dare. Do you want to leave a letter with me so that I can have it delivered to your next of kin in the likely event that you don't return?Gurok the Usurper^67^All^Nagrand^Gordawg^Gordawg^The Underneath^^^Gordawg at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand has asked that you destroy Gurok the Usurper and bring back Gurok's Earthen Head.^Gurok must be summoned. You summon Gurok and you destroy. You must go to Warmaul Hill to the northwest and find where ogre worships Gurok. You put ogre skull from Warmaul ogres on Gurok's earthen brand. Only then will Gurok come. Seven skulls. If you live, bring Gordawg back Gurok earthen head. Gordawg crushes head. <Gordawg bites down hard, shaking the earth beneath your feet.>Windroc Mastery^65^All^Nagrand^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^Windroc Mastery^^^Kill 12 Windrocs and then return to Fitz at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^Do you live for the hunt as I do, <class>? Do you seek the quietude that comes as you stalk your prey? Would you know what it is to honor the last heartbeats of your fallen quarry? I will help you to achieve this. Nagrand is a lush land, full of life in the midst of this broken world. Bring down a handful of the windrocs and then we will speak more. You can find them in many places nearby in all directions around our camp.Windroc Mastery^67^All^Nagrand^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^Windroc Mastery^^^Hunt down 12 Ravenous Windrocs and then return to Fitz at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^You must always push yourself if you are to one day stalk the mightiest of prey! While you are not yet ready, I will point you in the right direction. There is another breed of windroc even deadlier. Seek out the ravenous windroc to test your mettle against. You will find them in the heart of Nagrand to the west and southwest.Windroc Mastery^67^All^Nagrand^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^Windroc Mastery^^^Bring the Eye of Gutripper to Fitz at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^You are ready, <class>. Ready to face the mother of all windrocs, Gutripper! Honor demands that after hunting so many of her children that you give her the chance to defeat you! Seek her out amongst the greater windroc far to the west. Should you survive, bring her eye to me.Talbuk Mastery^65^All^Nagrand^Harold Lane^Harold Lane^Talbuk Mastery^^^Kill 12 Talbuk Stags and then return to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^I don't think that I'm up to the hunt today. Do you think that you might take my place? I told Hemet that I was going to see about bagging us some of those talbuk that seem to be all over the place. The stags are especially nice to hunt. You can find them congregated around the nearby trees. Think that you could take care of that for me?Talbuk Mastery^66^All^Nagrand^Harold Lane^Harold Lane^Talbuk Mastery^^^Hunt down 12 Talbuk Thorngrazers and then return to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^This darned scratch is getting the worst of me it would seem. So, are you up to filling... in for me again? This time you're going to bag yourself some thorngrazers. They're tougher and wilier than the stags, so keep your wits about you. Look for them... ... sheltered under the trees in the middle of Nagrand to the west and south. Go on, get out there and... show Hemet what you're made of. I'll be fine.Talbuk Mastery^66^All^Nagrand^Harold Lane^Harold Lane^Talbuk Mastery^^^Obtain the Hoof of Bach'lor and return it to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^<Wracking cough.> Don't worry about... me. I'll be fine. It's just a... scratch. Just the same, I think you'll... ... have to fill in for me one more... ... time. You must seek out the great Bach'lor, king of... the stags. It's ok if you... ... take friends along. Bring me one of his hooves..., ... as confirmation. Look for him... leading his herd in the far west of Nagrand.The New Directive^70^All^Dalaran Crater^Archmage Alturus^Archmage Cedric^The Master's Touch^^^Speak to Archmage Cedric in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater.^Return to Cedric at once, <name>. The aid you've given the Violet Eye will not go unrewarded. Think what you want of us and our organization, <class>, but gaining the favor of the archmages of Dalaran will not be something you regret.The Howling Wind^67^All^Nagrand^Howling Wind^Elementalist Morgh^The Howling Wind^^^Find someone at the Throne of the Elements that knows how to speak Kalimag and show them the Howling Wind.^This amorphous mass of elemental air is speaking to you in a language that you cannot understand. You believe the language to be the tongue of the elements: Kalimag. Perhaps someone at the Throne of the Elements could shed some insight on this unusual find.Murkblood Corrupters^67^All^Nagrand^Elementalist Morgh^Elementalist Morgh^The Howling Wind^^^Elementalist Morgh at the Throne of the Elements in Nagrand wants you to slay 5 Murkblood Putrifiers.^Murkblood are capturing and torturing the spirits of air! Murkblood are my kin: A tribe of the Broken who serve the vile Musel'ek, beast lord of Coilfang. The air spirit states that the Murkblood putrifiers are capturing other spirits of air and using them to sow chaos into the ranks of the elements. It would seem that the Murkblood have recently sacked an orc village to the southwest known as Sunspring and are using powerful elemental magic to disturb the lake. Find the putrifiers and destroy them.Vile Idolatry^66^Horde^Nagrand^Farseer Kurkush^Farseer Kurkush^^^^Farseer Kurkush at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to bring him 10 Murkblood Idols.^With our leadership in ruin, we are left open to attacks from all sides. The foul Murkblood tribe could not have picked a better time to attack us! In recent days, we have been subject to no less than 5 assaults from the Broken. They have even taken over our only other territorial holding in the area: Sunspring Post. We must strike and show them that we are not powerless! Strike down the vile idolaters and bring me their twisted idols of worship so that they may ride the lightning.The Missing War Party^67^Horde^Nagrand^Farseer Corhuk^Saurfang the Younger^The Missing War Party^^^Try and find the missing Garadar war party.^After the last Murkblood raid, a group of younglings decided to act. We tried to stop them but the rage had taken hold. It has now been one week since we last saw our beloved younglings. Please, <race>, you must find them! They have just barely reached adolescence. How can they expect to defeat such savages? They took the road leading west out of town. Follow that road around and look for signs of our younglings. And <name>, avoid Halaa if you value your life. It is a war-zone.Once Were Warriors^67^Horde^Nagrand^Saurfang the Younger^Saurfang the Younger^The Missing War Party^^^Kill 20 Murkblood Scavengers and 10 Murkblood Raiders.^I do not know you, stranger, but I ask for your help. I feel shame for this, but I am only one orc. Emotions have surfaced that I have never felt. I... I seek vengeance. Blood for blood. Do your people ever feel this? I wish to pick up my axe and split my enemies in two. To swing the weapon until my arms fall lifelessly at my sides, exhausted. Sunspring Post is directly south of this procession. It is there that you will find our enemies... Kill them... Kill them all...He Will Walk The Earth...^67^Horde^Nagrand^Saurfang the Younger^Farseer Corhuk^The Missing War Party^^^Deliver the news to Farseer Corhuk at Garadar.^Will you do me one last honor, <name>? I do not wish to return to Garadar. I believe that my destiny lies elsewhere - that I will serve a greater purpose someday. Please, return to Farseer Corhuk and tell him that I will not be returning. That I cannot return. I must walk the earth... He will understand.Murkblood Leaders...^67^All^Nagrand^Farseer Margadesh^Farseer Margadesh^^^^Farseer Margadesh at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to bring him the Head of Ortor of Murkblood.^We have lost many friends in recent weeks. For decades we have dealt with the ogres of Nagrand but now a new threat has arisen. The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town. While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him.The Totem of Kar'dash^67^Horde^Nagrand^Mag'har Captive^Garrosh^^^A Visit With the Greatmother^Escort the Mag'har Captive out of Sunspring Post. Speak to Garrosh at Garadar if you succeed.^Thank you, stranger. They would have surely killed me had it not been for you. I was kidnapped by these Murkbloods 3 nights ago during a nighttime raid on Garadar. What I have since uncovered may very well shake the foundation of the Outland: these savages seek to recover the totem of Kar'dash! We cannot allow the totem to fall into the hands of the Murkbloods! You must help me escape. And stranger, if I do not make it back to Garadar, you must tell Garrosh what happened here...The Throne of the Elements^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Elementalist Ioki^Elementalist Sharvak^^^^Elementalist Ioki wants you to travel to the Throne of the Elements and speak with Elementalist Sharvak.^Greetings, <race>. I am Ioki, elementalist of the Earthen Ring. I have come to Telaar to inform the Kurenai of the state of the elements. Could I ask a favor of you? Would you travel to the Throne of the Elements in the northern hills of Nagrand, beyond Skysong Lake, and tell elementalist Sharvak that I have arrived at Telaar safely? She will surely reward you for this small deed.The Throne of the Elements^66^Horde^Nagrand^Elementalist Yal'hah^Elementalist Sharvak^^^^Elementalist Yal'hah wants you to travel to the Throne of the Elements and speak with Elementalist Sharvak.^Greetings, <race>. I am Yal'hah, elementalist of the Earthen Ring. I have come to Garadar to inform the Mag'har of the state of the elements. Could I ask a favor of you? Would you travel to the Throne of the Elements in the northern hills of Nagrand, beyond Skysong Lake, and tell elementalist Sharvak that I have arrived at Garadar safely? She will surely reward you for this small deed.Murkblood Invaders^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Murkblood Invasion Plans^Arechron^Murkblood Invaders^^^Take the Murkblood Invasion Plans to Arechron at Telaar in Nagrand.^The parchment holds a crudely painted map of Nagrand. There is a big red 'X' where Telaar would be on the map. It would seem that these savages are planning an attack on the city. Take the Murkblood invasion plans to Arechron in Telaar.Murkblood Invaders^67^Horde^Nagrand^Murkblood Invasion Plans^Garrosh^^^^Take the Murkblood Invasion Plans to Garrosh.^The parchment holds a crudely painted map of Nagrand. There is a big red 'X' where Garadar would be on the map. It would seem that these savages are planning an attack on the city. Take the Murkblood invasion plans to Garrosh in Garadar.Ortor My Old Friend...^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Arechron^Arechron^Murkblood Invaders^^^Arechron at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to kill Ortor of Murkblood.^These invasion plans were written by someone I once knew. Ortor of Murkblood, once a noble Broken, versed in the way of the elements, now a muck addled yes-man of Musel'ek the bog lord. The plans state that they have taken over an orc village northwest of here known as Sunspring. Travel to Sunspring Post and rid the world of Ortor of Murkblood. What you do, you do for the good of us all...Stopping the Spread^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Otonbu the Sage^Otonbu the Sage^^^^Otonbu the Sage at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to use the Torch of Liquid Fire to destroy 10 Sunspring Villager corpses. Return the Torch of Liquid Fire when the task is complete.^I have just gotten word of a catastrophe of epic proportions, <name>. The foul Murkblood have sacked the orc village of Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and murdered its residents. To make matters worse, they have begun dumping the bodies into Sunspring Lake. Should those bodies rot, our primary source of water in the region will be compromised. It's a gruesome task that I give you next but it must be done. Take this enchanted torch and return to Sunspring. Burn all of the rotting orc corpses...Uncatalogued Species^63^All^Zangarmarsh^Uncatalogued Species^Lauranna Thar'well^^^^Bring the Uncatalogued Species to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Lauranna must've missed this particular plant. You're certain you've discovered a species not yet catalogued by Lauranna's work. You'd best show it to her to see what she makes of it.Failed Incursion^65^All^Coilfang Reservoir^Ysiel Windsinger^Watcher Jhang^^Return to the Marsh^Lost in Action^Ysiel Windsinger wants you to look for signs of Cenarion Expedition Druids near the entrance to Coilfang Reservoir in Zangarmarsh.^I sent a small group of our druids to investigate the drain you discovered inside of Serpent Lake. They were expected to return shortly after. Needless to say, they did not. You are amongst our most capable allies; I ask you to seek them and find out what became of them.A Restorative Draught^20^Horde^Ghostlands^Arcanist Janeda^Apothecary Renzithen^A Restorative Draught^War on Deatholme^^Speak to Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien.^The battle against the Scourge is not one without casualties. Many are slain every day yet many more meet a worse fate. It is not uncommon for the Scourge to take prisoners. Death would be preferable to what awaits them in Deatholme. They're interrogated and tortured while under the effects of horrible will-breaking poisons. Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien has developed a remedy; go to him and retrieve this restorative draught.Solving the Problem^67^All^Nagrand^Poli'lukluk the Wiser^Poli'lukluk the Wiser^^^^Poli'lukluk the Wiser at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to kill 10 Murkblood Scavengers and 5 Murkblood Raiders.^The appearance of the Murkblood in Nagrand has had a profound negative impact on our environment. The elementals are all in flux which has, in turn, greatly disturbed the wildlife. Worse yet, the razing of Sunspring Post has reignited the hatred that the orcs held for our people. While the Kurenai are a different tribe than the Murkblood, all an orc sees is Broken. We must make an effort to solve this dilemma. Travel to Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and resolve the Murkblood problem.The Totem of Kar'dash^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Kurenai Captive^Arechron^^^^Escort the Kurenai Captive out of Sunspring Post. Speak to Arechron at Telaar if you succeed.^I would have been killed had you not come along, stranger. They have already murdered so many Kurenai in their search for a lost relic. What they seek is the totem of Kar'dash. Why they think that we would know anything about this totem, I cannot understand. Is a totem not an orcish implement by nature? This information must be taken back to Arechron. Perhaps he knows why Murkblood are kidnapping Kurenai and torturing them for information regarding an orcish device. Let's go before more come.Stealing from Thieves^66^All^Nagrand^Gezhe^Gezhe^^^More Crystal Fragments^Obtain 10 Oshu'gun Crystal Fragments and bring them to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.^Nexus Prince Haramad has ordered us to not begin work inside of Oshu'gun as it might anger a certain powerful naaru. Sort of puts a damper on our operation. I think I might've found a loophole, however. You see, we're not the only ethereals drawn to this colossal diamond. A thief called Gava'xi has led a band of rogue ethereals into Oshu'gun and they've begun to dislodge large fragments from it. Your job, <race>, is to go there and retrieve what is rightfully ours.The Impotent Leader^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Jorin Deadeye^Kilrath^The Impotent Leader^^^Jorin Deadeye has asked that you find and speak with Kilrath.^I have escaped certain death, surviving a cowardly nighttime attack by Boulderfist ogres upon my village. But I ask you, stranger: For what? <Jorin points to Garrosh.> He has refused to give us assistance. Ogres are rampaging through my town and he sits here, weeping into a fire. What has become of us? What will become of us? I've sent a scout, Kilrath, to the village, now the Bleeding Hollow Ruins. Will you find him and give him your assistance? He hides on the border of Nagrand and Terokkar.Don't Kill the Fat One^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Kilrath^Unkor the Ruthless^The Impotent Leader^^^Kilrath in Terokkar Forest has asked that you kill 10 Boulderfist Invaders and beat Unkor the Ruthless until he talks.^I have been watching these beasts for days. The fat one says that he is waiting for something. What he is waiting for, however, is a mystery. I have a plan but it is going to involve some violence on your part. You will need to kill several of his subordinates and then beat him within an inch of his life. Do this and I am certain he will tell us everything that we need to know.Success!^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Unkor the Ruthless^Kilrath^The Impotent Leader^^^Take the information that you beat out of Unkor back to Kilrath in Terokkar Forest.^For many years, Boulderfist ruled all ogres in the Outland. The ogres were united under Krol and content with the lands that they were given. In the past few months, we have lost many ogres to a new clan known as Warmaul. Warmaul has taken most of our land in Nagrand and killed many of our people. We had no choice but to take this town. We are being exterminated... Krol has gone missing and Boulderfist is in turmoil. Lantresor of the Blade rules in his absence.Because Kilrath is a Coward^65^Horde^Nagrand^Kilrath^Jorin Deadeye^The Impotent Leader^^Standards and Practices^Take the information that you beat out of Unkor to Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand.^Take what you have learned and tell Jorin at Garadar. I can assure you that he won't be happy to know that our village was destroyed and many of our people killed because the ogres needed more space. May the ancestors watch over you... I will be hiding in the bushes if you need me for anything else.Obsidian Warbeads^67^All^Nagrand^Gezhe^Gezhe^^^More Obsidian Warbeads^Bring 10 Obsidian Warbeads to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.^All this waiting around for Oshu'gun to be ready for digging is eating into our profits, <name>. Fortunately, I've devised an alternate source of income. The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds. Zerid already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security. Think of the warbeads as an added bonus. Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me.Safeguarding the Watchers^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Windcaller Blackhoof^Windcaller Blackhoof^^The Umbrafen Tribe^^Kill Lord Klaq and return to Windcaller Blackhoof at the Cenarion Refuge.^In your travels, you might have encountered some of the expedition's watchers. They do the majority of the field work: documenting the unique inhabitants of the marsh, collecting samples, and making contact with sentient species. The safety of the watchers is paramount, <class>. We've had to recall the watchers we sent to explore Funggor Cavern to the south, because of marshbeast attacks. Warden Hamoot believes that killing their leader, Lord Klaq, will bring a swift end to the attacks.The Dying Balance^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Lethyn Moonfire^Lethyn Moonfire^^^^Locate and deal with Boglash, then return to Lethyn Moonfire at Cenarion Refuge.^Have you observed your surroundings closely, <name>? This is an ailing landscape, struggling to keep itself in balance and losing the fight. If you know where to look, you can see the symptoms. Members of some species rapidly outgrow their peers and become more aggressive. A good example of this uncontrolled growth is the marshtrekker Boglash. If you wish to see it for yourself, look no further than the waterways south of the refuge. Be prepared to defend yourself. The creature knows no mercy.Blacksting's Bane^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Prospector Conall^Prospector Conall^^Unfinished Business^^Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Prospector Conall at Telredor.^By Khaz'goroth's flaming navel, it's hot here! I can't blame the first party for leaving, but everyone knows 'twasn't the heat that drove them away. No, it was Blacksting, although they won't admit it. They were camped just to the south of the glowing draenei towers to the west, just north of the Feralfen Village, when the giant wasp appears out of nowhere and attacks! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I bring the creature's stinger back to Ironforge and show it to them!I'm Saved!^65^All^Nagrand^Kristen Dipswitch^Harold Lane^^^^Give the Bundle of Skins to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^I don't mind sharing. I'm just glad to be saved from that creep, Gankly! And I collected tons of skins from Zangarmarsh, so it's no problem at all!Nothin' Says Lovin' Like a Big Stinger^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Reavij^Reavij^Menacing Marshfangs^^A Job Undone^Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Reavij at Swamprat Post.^She will be mine. Oh yes - she will be mine. Isn't Magasha the most beautiful troll you've ever seen? I have to find a way to win her heart. Sure, she has her eye on Zurai, but that is about to change. My foolproof plan will see to that. All I need is a way to demonstrate my superior hunting skills, and that's where you come in my friend. There's a gigantic bog wasp known as Blacksting that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. Bring me its stinger and I'll work my magic.A Job Undone^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Magasha^Magasha^^Nothin' Says Lovin' Like a Big Stinger^^Magasha at Swamprat Post wants you to kill Sporewing.^Someone needs to find a way to make Reavij come to his senses! He's ignoring his duty and instead, he's devoting all his energy to getting my attention. I've tried ignoring him and telling him to stop. Nothing seems to work. Until he gets over this, I'm left cleaning up after him. He was supposed to have dealt with Sporewing, but I'll bet the monster is alive and well. If you have time, would you mind going to the western part of the Dead Mire and killing the bat? I'll deal with Reavij in the meantime.Gava'xi^67^All^Nagrand^Zerid^Zerid^^^^Slay Gava'xi near Oshu'gun and return to Zerid at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.^The presence of rogue ethereals in this area might amuse Gezhe, who sees nothing but opportunity wherever we go, but it's a true threat to the security of our operations. Their leader, Gava'xi, is a dangerous criminal and I've made it my top priority to see to it that he is neutralized. If you're looking to make yourself useful, go and take care of Gava'xi. I will see to it that you're rewarded properly.Unfinished Business^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Prospector Conall^Prospector Conall^^^Blacksting's Bane^Prospector Conall at Telredor wants you to kill Sporewing.^The first expedition the league sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them. What's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the Dead Mire. I think Vindicator Idaar mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor.The Terror of Marshlight Lake^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Puluu^Puluu^^^^Slay Terrorclaw and return to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage.^Traveling through naga-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At Marshlight Lake, to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant bogstrok, is ready to feed. I needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet.The Biggest of Them All^64^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Zurjaya^Zurjaya^Angling to Beat the Competition^^^Slay Mragesh and return to Zurjaya in Zabra'jin.^You've dealt with most of the little hydra, but I doubt Mragesh was impressed by your display. He's a cunning, ferocious beast and he's dogged many an angler in his time. I intend to be the last one he'll ever bother. He's bound to be hiding deep in the waters of Serpent Lake, to the northeast. He's a has-been; he just doesn't know it yet.Pursuing Terrorclaw^64^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Zurjaya^Zurjaya^^Angling to Beat the Competition^^Kill Terrorclaw and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin.^I've caught every kind of fish that lives in the marsh, but there's one that eludes me. Sure, I've caught eels and mudfin frenzies. But the last time I was out on one of the islands in Marshlight Lake, I hooked a gigantic bogstrok that snapped my line and got away. Terrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way.Maktu's Revenge^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Maktu^Maktu^Natural Armor^^^Locate and kill Mragesh, then return to Maktu at the Orebor Harborage.^Last time Maktu was out hunting hydras for hides at Serpent Lake, he was attacked by the biggest hydra he's ever seen. Maktu reached for his spear, but it was too late. He had just enough time to escape becoming hydra food. Who knows? Maybe next time, Maktu not be so lucky. Maktu wants to be there so there won't be a next time. Will you help Maktu get his revenge on Mragesh?Message in a Battle^65^Horde^Nagrand^Jorin Deadeye^Jorin Deadeye^The Impotent Leader^^^Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 8 Boulderfist Crushers and 8 Boulderfist Mystics.^Ogres are moved by one thing: Might. If we expose ourselves to them as being weak, they will take advantage of that weakness and wipe us out. Garrosh might be ready to lie down and let the ogre dogs take our lands but I am not! I need you to deliver a message to the Boulderfist, <name>. The only type of message that they are capable of understanding: Brutality. Travel to the Burning Blade Ruins, southeast of here and show them the might of the Mag'har. And <name>, check in with the others before leaving.An Audacious Advance^66^Horde^Nagrand^Jorin Deadeye^Jorin Deadeye^The Impotent Leader^^^Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 10 Boulderfist Warriors and 10 Boulderfist Mages.^Directly west of here you will find the Halaani Basin. Within the basin are the twin clefts of Nagrand: Northwind and Southwind. Boulderfist shock troops use the clefts to hide their ogre mounds. I need you to track down those troops and kill all that you encounter in the name of Mag'har.Standards and Practices^65^Horde^Nagrand^Elkay'gan the Mystic^Elkay'gan the Mystic^Standards and Practices^Because Kilrath is a Coward^^Elkay'gan the Mystic at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to use the Mag'har Battle Standard at the First Burning Blade Pyre, Second Burning Blade Pyre, and Third Burning Blade Pyre. Return the left-over Mag'har Battle Standards to him when you are finished.^If you're venturing into the Burning Blade Ruins, I have a task for you. Take these Mag'har battle standards and place them at three distinct locations in the ogre compound. An area of high visibility is recommended. Look for the gigantic flaming pyres on the upper levels. Place a standard near the first, second, and third Burning Blade pyres. The standard will leave a lasting impression upon any ogres who may have missed the battle.The Count of the Marshes^64^All^Zangarmarsh^"Count" Ungula's Mandible^Watcher Leesa'oh^^^^Bring "Count" Ungula's Mandible to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Outpost in Zangarmarsh.^This bloody mandible comes from an unbelievably large creature. The nether ray that it belonged to has to be the largest ever seen in Zangarmarsh. Judging from the condition of the mandible, the count must've abandoned a diet of carrion in favor of living flesh. Surely the Cenarion Expedition would be interested in such a specimen. Watcher Leesa'oh has a small camp to the west of Quagg Ridge.The Cenarion Expedition^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Amythiel Mistwalker^Ysiel Windsinger^^^^Speak to Ysiel Windsinger at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition. Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body. The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost. Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh. Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there.The Consortium Needs You!^66^All^Nagrand^Consortium Recruiter^Gezhe^^^^Report to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.^My organization, the Consortium, is looking for a few resourceful individuals just like yourself. You'll be hard pressed to find ethereals more honest, hard-working or pleasant to be around than us. All we require is loyalty, dedication and a reasonable amount of moral flexibility. If you're interested, speak to Gezhe, our ground operations leader. You will find him at Aeris Landing, north of Oshu'gun.A Head Full of Ivory^66^All^Nagrand^Shadrek^Shadrek^^^More Heads Full of Ivory^Collect 3 Pair of Ivory Tusks and return them to Shadrek at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.^Ivory is a much sought after prize. I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it. I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits. The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after. Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire. Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei. Do you and I have an understanding?Bleeding Hollow Supply Crates^66^Horde^Nagrand^Elkay'gan the Mystic^Elkay'gan the Mystic^Standards and Practices^^^Elkay'gan the Mystic at Garadar in Nagrand wants you to recover 10 Bleeding Hollow Supply Crates.^The Boulderfist have moved the supplies they stole from our village to the twin clefts of Nagrand, found west of here in the Halaani Basin. While you are in the area, keep your eye out for the supply crates. If we can get those back, it would ease much of the burden that has fallen upon the matrons of Garadar.Do My Eyes Deceive Me^65^Alliance^Nagrand^Huntress Bintook^Huntress Bintook^Do My Eyes Deceive Me^^^Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to recover Boulderfist Plans.^Do my eyes deceive me or is there an ogre hunting party over yonder? What could ogres be doing this far from their mound? I don't like this one bit, stranger. First Murkbloods and now ogres. We just don't have the manpower to handle all of these threats to our land. Could you investigate the ogre presence to the east for us? Their forward camp is about 200 paces east of here. You'll know you're at the right place if you see the Boulderfist hunters. Kill them to find the plans!Not On My Watch!^65^Alliance^Nagrand^Huntress Bintook^Huntress Bintook^Do My Eyes Deceive Me^^^Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to speak to Lump. Return to Huntress Bintook when you have gathered the information that she requested.^The battle plans were written up by an ogre lieutenant. His name is either Dump or Lump. <Bintook turns the parchment sideways and cocks her head.> It could also be Billy. Anyhow, I think you should go back out there and have a word with Billy or Lump or Dumpy or whatever! Try to approach him diplomatically. If that doesn't work, try using some muscle.Sporeggar^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Fahssn^Msshi'fn^^^^Go to Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh, north of the Spawning Glen, and deliver the Salvaged Spore Sacs to Msshi'fn.^You're a kind <race>, <name>. Not like some of the others I've met. You should meet the rest of my people; they'll be very grateful for your help. Take these spore sacs to my leader, Msshi'fn. You will find him in Sporeggar, north of here.Mo'mor the Breaker^65^Alliance^Nagrand^Huntress Bintook^Mo'mor the Breaker^Do My Eyes Deceive Me^^^Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to speak to Mo'mor the Breaker.^You must seek out Mo'mor immediately! You will find him in the center of Telaar, by the fountain. Tell him exactly what the ogre told you.The Ruins of Burning Blade^65^Alliance^Nagrand^Mo'mor the Breaker^Mo'mor the Breaker^Do My Eyes Deceive Me^^^Mo'mor the Breaker at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to kill 8 Boulderfist Crushers and 8 Boulderfist Mystics.^These ogre hunting parties are a precursor to invasion. We must strike at them before they have a chance to amass an army big enough to take over our town. You're going to need to get your hands dirty, <race>. The largest collection of Boulderfist in this region can be found at the Burning Blade Ruins, almost directly east of Telaar, near the border of Terokkar. Go there and show the Boulderfist that Telaar will not bend to their will!The Twin Clefts of Nagrand^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Mo'mor the Breaker^Mo'mor the Breaker^Do My Eyes Deceive Me^^^Mo'mor the Breaker at Telaar in Nagrand has asked that you slay 10 Boulderfist Warriors and 10 Boulderfist Mages.^You made a strong showing, <name>. Are you ready for more? I have received reports of a large contingent of Boulderfist ogres hidden in the twin clefts of Nagrand, northwest of here in the Halaani Basin. Venture forth to the clefts and deal with the remaining Boulderfist ogres.HELP!^65^Alliance^Nagrand^Corki^Arechron^HELP!^^^Find the Boulderfist Key and Free Corki. Speak with Arechron in Telaar should you succeed.^HELP! They're gonna eat me! I just know it! Find the key, I know it has to be on one of these ogres. If you get me out of here, my father will reward you handsomely! He's the leader of Telaar, Arechron.Corki's Gone Missing Again!^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Arechron^Arechron^HELP!^^Corki's Ransom^Arechron at Telaar has asked that you find and free Corki.^<Arechron sighs.> This is so embarrassing. Do you remember my boy, Corki? You rescued him from the Burning Blade Ruins recently. Well, his curiosity has gotten the best of him once more. He told me that he was going to investigate the Boulderfist menace for 'uncle' Mo'mor and ran off to the ogre mounds in the Halaani Basin, north of here. Do you think you could track him down? I would be eternally grateful.Matters of Security^66^All^Nagrand^Zerid^Zerid^^^^Zerid at Aeris Landing in Nagrand wants you to kill 8 Voidspawn near Oshu'gun.^Gezhe chose to base our operations as close to Oshu'gun as possible, without any regard for the safety of our crew. Why? Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south. Never mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us. That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's. Kill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget. Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget.Ruthless Cunning^66^All^Nagrand^Lantresor of the Blade^Lantresor of the Blade^^Diplomatic Measures^Returning the Favor, Body of Evidence^Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to drive 10 Warmaul Ogre Banners through the bodies of Kil'sorrow members at Kil'sorrow Fortress.^<Lantresor hands you a pack full of banners.> These are Warmaul ogre banners that I recently acquired. I want you to travel to Kil'sorrow Fortress, directly south of here, and kill as many of the Kil'sorrow filth as you can find. Drive a Warmaul ogre banner through the heart of each fallen Kil'sorrow soldier. Return to me when you have completed this task and the other that this plan requires.Armaments for Deception^66^All^Nagrand^Lantresor of the Blade^Lantresor of the Blade^^Diplomatic Measures^^Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to collect 10 Kil'sorrow Armaments.^You will need to steal Kil'sorrow armaments from Kil'sorrow Fortress if my plan is to work. Search the fortress for crates of Kil'sorrow armaments. Bring whatever you can find to me. Kil'sorrow Fortress is located directly south and a little to the west of the Burning Blade Ruins.Returning the Favor^66^All^Nagrand^Lantresor of the Blade^Lantresor of the Blade^^Ruthless Cunning^Message to Telaar, Message to Garadar^Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to drive 10 Kil'sorrow Banners through the bodies of Warmaul ogres at the Laughing Skull Ruins.^Now you must plant the seed of war in the fat, useless heads of the Warmaul. To the northwest, near the mountains, you will find the Laughing Skull Ruins. <Lantresor points into the crate of armaments you brought him.> Do you recognize those banners? They are Kil'sorrow banners. I want you to take a stack of Kil'sorrow banners and plant them on the corpses of Warmaul ogres. Remember, northwest is where you will find the ogres.Body of Evidence^66^All^Nagrand^Lantresor of the Blade^Lantresor of the Blade^^Ruthless Cunning^^Lantresor of the Blade at the Burning Blade Ruins in Nagrand wants you to use the Damp Woolen Blanket at the Blazing Warmaul Pyre in the Laughing Skull Courtyard to signal his ogres.^Your rampage through Kil'sorrow Fortress has provided us with a special opportunity. We have enough bodies to make it appear as if a great battle has taken place. Travel to the Laughing Skull Ruins and find the Laughing Skull Courtyard. There should be a blazing pyre in the courtyard. Make sure the area is secure and then use this blanket to send up smoke signals. When my ogres see the smoke, they will sneak in and plant the bodies of slain Kil'sorrow soldiers. That should be the final straw!Message to Telaar^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Lantresor of the Blade^Arechron^^Returning the Favor^^Take the Burning Blade Peace Offering to Arechron at Telaar in Nagrand.^<Lantresor points to an unmarked crate.> Take it. It is my offering to your people. You have single-handedly saved my clan from extermination. You may tell your leader that Lantresor of the Burning Blade and his Boulderfist ogres accept the offering of peace. <Lantresor bows.>Message to Garadar^66^Horde^Nagrand^Lantresor of the Blade^Garrosh^^Returning the Favor^A Visit With the Greatmother^Take the Burning Blade Peace Offering to Garrosh at Garadar.^<Lantresor points to an unmarked crate.> Take it. It is my offering to your people. You have single-handedly saved my clan from extermination. You may tell your leader that Lantresor of the Burning Blade and his Boulderfist ogres accept the offering of peace. <Lantresor bows.>Wanted: Giselda the Crone^66^Horde^Nagrand^Garadar Bulletin Board^Warden Bullrok^^^Wanted: Durn the Hungerer^Slay Giselda the Crone and any combination of 10 Kil'sorrow Agents. Return to Warden Bullrok at Garadar should you complete this task.^Wanted: Dead or Alive Giselda the Crone of Kil'sorrow and her lackeys for murder, ritual sacrifice, communing with the Legion, kidnapping, and burglary. Known to congregate at Kil'sorrow Fortress in southeastern Nagrand, near the border of Terokkar. Large gold reward to be dispensed by Warden Bullrok at Garadar to anyone able to bring Giselda to justice.Wanted: Giselda the Crone^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Telaar Bulletin Board^Warden Moi'bff Jill^^^Wanted: Durn the Hungerer^Slay Giselda the Crone and any combination of 10 Kil'sorrow Agents. Return to Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar should you complete this task.^Wanted: Dead or Alive Giselda the Crone of Kil'sorrow and her lackeys for murder, ritual sacrifice, communing with the Legion, kidnapping, and burglary. Known to congregate at Kil'sorrow Fortress in southeastern Nagrand, near the border of Terokkar. Large gold reward to be dispensed by Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar to anyone able to bring Giselda to justice.Wanted: Durn the Hungerer^67^Horde^Nagrand^Warden Bullrok^Warden Bullrok^^Wanted: Giselda the Crone, Wanted: Zorbo the Advisor^^Slay Durn the Hungerer. Return to Warden Bullrok if you manage to complete this task.^You have destroyed two of the biggest threats in Nagrand, <name>. Are you ready to take on the scourge of the Spirit Fields? Durn the Hungerer lords over the area surrounding Oshu'gun, decimating all in his path. Thus far, none have been able to rid Nagrand of this ferocious gronn. Gather your allies and venture to the Spirit Fields, far southwest of here, near Oshu'gun, and track down Durn. Slay him and I assure you rewards commensurate with the difficulty of the task at hand.Wanted: Durn the Hungerer^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Warden Moi'bff Jill^Warden Moi'bff Jill^^Wanted: Giselda the Crone, Wanted: Zorbo the Advisor^^Slay Durn the Hungerer.

Durn the Hungerer lords over the area surrounding Oshu'gun, decimating all in his path. Thus far, none have been able to rid Nagrand of this ferocious gronn.

Slay him and I assure you rewards commensurate with the difficulty of the task at hand.Wanted: Zorbo the Advisor^66^Horde^Nagrand^Garadar Bulletin Board^Warden Bullrok^^^Wanted: Durn the Hungerer^Slay Zorbo the Advisor, 5 Warmaul Shaman and 5 Warmaul Reavers. Return to Warden Bullrok if you manage to complete this task.^Wanted: Dead or Alive Zorbo the Advisor, wanted for numerous planned attacks on Garadar. Along with his reavers and shaman, Zorbo has slain countless orcs. Consider Zorbo as armed, dangerous, and merciless. Zorbo makes his home in the Laughing Skull Ruins in the northern mountains of Nagrand. Reward for Zorbo the Advisor's death or capture to be dispensed by Warden Bullrok at Garadar.Wanted: Zorbo the Advisor^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Telaar Bulletin Board^Warden Moi'bff Jill^^^Wanted: Durn the Hungerer^Slay Zorbo the Advisor, 5 Warmaul Shaman and 5 Warmaul Reavers. Return to Warden Moi'bff Jill if you manage to complete this task.^Wanted: Dead or Alive Zorbo the Advisor, wanted for numerous planned attacks on Telaar. Along with his reavers and shaman, Zorbo has slain countless Broken. Consider Zorbo as armed, dangerous, and merciless. Zorbo makes his home in the Laughing Skull Ruins in the northern mountains of Nagrand. Reward for Zorbo the Advisor's death or capture to be dispensed by Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar.Missing Mag'hari Procession^67^Horde^Nagrand^Matron Drakia^Elder Yorley^Missing Mag'hari Procession^^^Search for the missing Mag'hari procession.^Greatmother says that we must press on and serve our people. She says that we must serve as an example for Garrosh - to show that life goes on. I have so many matters to attend to here, especially with Greatmother having taken ill. Would you honor the Mag'har by helping one of their matrons? Several days ago we sent a funeral procession to the Ancestral Grounds and they have yet to return. Will you go search for them? They took the western road out of Garadar. Follow it around and avoid Halaa.War on the Warmaul^67^Horde^Nagrand^Elder Yorley^Elder Yorley^Missing Mag'hari Procession^^^Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you slay 8 Warmaul Brutes and 8 Warmaul Warlocks.^We were en route to the Ancestral Grounds when we were ambushed by Warmaul. They came from all sides, killing several of the procession guards and many of the others. They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon. And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low. I am a spiritual orc, <name>, but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them!Cho'war the Pillager^67^Horde^Nagrand^Elder Yorley^Elder Yorley^Missing Mag'hari Procession^^^Elder Yorley at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you slay Cho'war the Pillager and retrieve the Head of Cho'war.^Have you ever seen an ogre king, <race>? Few have and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are dealing with here. The leader of these barbarians is an ogre named Cho'war. Rumor has it that Cho'war was the ogre responsible for forcing the gronn out of the cave. Cho'war then declared himself king and dissolved the ogre clans that served under the gronn. Thus, Warmaul was born. Find Cho'war deep in the caves of Warmaul Hill. Slay him and bring me his head.Finding the Survivors^67^Horde^Nagrand^Elder Ungriz^Elder Ungriz^^^^Elder Ungriz at the Mag'hari Procession in Nagrand has asked that you free 5 Mag'har Prisoners.^If I know anything about ogres, it's that they like their food fresh. This means that the Mag'har that they captured are more than likely being kept alive until they are ready to serve. It's a sickening thought, I know, but one that we must use to our advantage. Venture to Warmaul Hill and search for Mag'har prisoners. If you find prisoners, then you will find keys to their cages on the nearby Warmaul ogres. Kill ogres for their keys and release the prisoners.It's Watching You!^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Warden Treelos^Warden Treelos^^^^Kill Naphthal'ar and then return to Warden Treelos at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^Quick, hide! The eyes of Naphthal'ar are upon you... upon us all! I dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you... you look as if you might know the right words to say. Just be careful, it doesn't like jokes and will not suffer fools easily. If you can, convince it to come down for tea. But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me!Corki's Ransom^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Arechron^Corki^Corki's Ransom^Corki's Gone Missing Again!^^Arechron wants you to find Corki at Warmaul Hill.^<Arechron shows you a grime covered letter.> I just received this letter. It's from a clan of ogres known as Warmaul that rule the northwestern lands of Nagrand. It says that they have Corki and if we don't cooperate, they're going to eat him. Admittedly, Corki is a moron, but he's still my blood. Will you rescue him, <name>? I presume that he's locked up in a cage somewhere on Warmaul Hill. That should be your first stop.Cho'war the Pillager^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Corki^Arechron^Corki's Ransom^^^Corki wants you to get Cho'war's Key so that you can free him from his cage. Return to Arechron at Telaar should you manage this task.^They call him Cho'war the pillager, <name>. He's the ogre that forced out the gronn that used to rule over these ogres. You better believe he's powerful! The chef said that Cho'war lives in the big cave - wherever that may be... Get that key and get me out of here! If we live through this, my father will no doubt give you the big reward! As soon as I'm free, seek him out.The Ravaged Caravan^67^All^Nagrand^Huntress Kima^Huntress Kima^^^^Huntress Kima at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to recover 10 Telaar Supply Crates.^I was part of a caravan taking supplies to the Orebor Harborage in Zangarmarsh. As we were nearing the border of the marsh, we were jumped by a vicious squad of Warmaul ogres. They killed the others and took me prisoner, along with all of our supplies. Thankfully, they neglected to place a backing on my cage. When they fell asleep, I made my escape. It's too late for my comrades but we could really use the supplies they stole. Warmaul Hill is in the northwestern mountains of Nagrand.What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Lethyn Moonfire^Earthbinder Tavgren^^^Strange Energy^Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time. <name>, I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening. There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from Shattrath City once you're in the forest.What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?^63^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Tooki^Earthbinder Tavgren^^^Strange Energy^Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^Hey there, <class>. We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time. I want you to go over there and check to see what's happening. You can find it by heading northwest through the forest.What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Jenai Starwhisper^Earthbinder Tavgren^^^Strange Energy^Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^<class>, I have urgent business for you. We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time. This is unusual as we usually hear from them at least once every few days. I want you to go up there and make sure that they're alright. You can find the thicket by heading northwest through the forest.What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Jenai Starwhisper^Earthbinder Tavgren^^^Strange Energy^Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^<class>, I have urgent business for you.

You can find the thicket by heading northwest through the forest.The Ring of Blood: The Blue Brothers^67^All^Nagrand^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Ring of Blood: Brokentoe^The Ring of Blood: Rokdar the Sundered L^Defeat the Murkblood Twins that call themselves the Blue Brothers. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.^This next battle involves a duo - twin brothers to be precise. They call themselves the "Blue Brothers." It's not too late to chicken out, <name>. I'd certainly understand. But if you're ready for some action, step in the Ring of Blood and wait for the Murkblood twins to arrive. Last one standing is the winner!Strange Energy^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Earthbinder Tavgren^Earthbinder Tavgren^^^By Any Means Necessary^Collect 4 Teromoth Samples and 4 Vicious Teromoth Samples. Then return to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside of the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^Something strange has changed the teromoths of the thicket. Where once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain. And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close. I need to compare the vicious ones to the normal. Collect for me a number of samples from both. You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north. I'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids.The Ring of Blood: Rokdar the Sundered Lord^67^All^Nagrand^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Ring of Blood: The Blue Brothers^The Ring of Blood: Skra'gath^Defeat Rokdar the Sundered Lord. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.^This fight is gonna be painful, <name>. Do you have any friends that are brave enough to help you out? The ogres managed to get a giant from Blade's Edge named Rokdar! Trust me, you're gonna need friends, he seems unbeatable! He's hard as a rock - literally! If you still want to fight him, step into the Ring of Blood and he will come.Clues in the Thicket^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Earthbinder Tavgren^Earthbinder Tavgren^^^^Investigate the Strange Object next to the Broken Corpse to determine what might have befallen the Cenarion Thicket. Then return to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the thicket in Terokkar Forest.^I have no idea what killed all of the druids here. I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south. Please, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy. Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us. When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him. And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless.The Ring of Blood: Skra'gath^67^All^Nagrand^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Ring of Blood: Rokdar the Sundered L^The Ring of Blood: The Warmaul Champion^Defeat Skra'gath. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.^You're murderin' 'em out there, kid! They got a ringer for the next match. They say he's a void lord or something... No way do they want you up against their champion. Did you here that palooka, Mogor, yapping at you? The bets are through the roof! Get in that ring and take this one out fast!The Ring of Blood: The Warmaul Champion^67^All^Nagrand^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Ring of Blood: Skra'gath^The Ring of Blood: The Final Challenge^Defeat the Warmaul Champion. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.^They had to ship the champion in from the Blade's Edge gladiator pits. He was training on mountain giants - three at a time. If you win this one, you become the new champion. What do you think your odds are, kid? Do you have a shot? Just give me the word and I'll bet the house on you. Now get in there and win!The Ring of Blood: The Final Challenge^68^All^Nagrand^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Ring of Blood: The Warmaul Champion^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras!^Defeat Mogor, Hero of the Warmaul. Should you win, speak with Wodin the Troll-Servant to collect your reward.^<Gurgthock is counting his massive pile of gold.> You've made me a lot of money, kid. If you can defeat Mogor, I promise to make it worth your while. All that pain you suffered in the Ring of Blood is gonna end up paying off. Now get in there and show these ogres what you're made of!By Any Means Necessary^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Earthbinder Tavgren^Empoor^By Any Means Necessary^Strange Energy^Wind Trader Lathrai^Find Empoor on the road between Tuurem and Shattrath City in Terokkar Forest. Convince him to tell you what he knows.^I don't know what to make of all of this, but I do know how we can find more clues. Empoor is a Broken merchant that traffics in all sorts of goods and information. If you were to persuade him to talk, I'm sure he might have something interesting to say. He travels the road here between Tuurem and Shattrath. Watch out, though -- he travels with a bodyguard.Wind Trader Lathrai^63^All^Shattrath City^Empoor^Wind Trader Lathrai^By Any Means Necessary^^^Speak with Wind Trader Lathrai near the World's End Tavern in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.^I was asked to pick up and deliver some boxes of goods from an ethereal in Shattrath City. Last I saw him, he was standing outside of the World's End Tavern in Lower City. His name is Wind Trader Lathrai, and that's all that I know! Want more answers, go talk with him!He Called Himself Altruis...^68^Alliance^Nagrand^Huntress Kima^Altruis the Sufferer^^^Survey the Land^If you are looking to fight the Burning Legion, find Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand.^A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week. He introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask us several questions about Nagrand. He claimed that he was hunting Legion. That such insanity was actually his job. Can you imagine? A person that would willingly hunt demons? Before he left, he asked that we let the would-be heroes in town know that he will be staying in western Nagrand for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him.He Called Himself Altruis...^68^Horde^Nagrand^Matron Celestine^Altruis the Sufferer^^^Survey the Land^If you are looking to fight the Burning Legion, find Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand.^A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week.

Luanga may have masterminded the capture and interrogation of Deirom, but it seems he was taking orders from someone else. You remember Thander mentioning that Andarl has studied the arakkoa. Perhaps he can decipher the scroll's contents.Host of the Hidden City^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Luanga's Orders^Kurgatok^^^^Bring Luanga's Orders to Kurgatok at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^Although you cannot read the strange script on the scroll, the ornate seal at the bottom of the document implies that it was drafted by an arakkoa of high standing. Luanga may have masterminded the capture and interrogation of Dugar, but it seems he was taking orders from someone else. You remember Rokag mentioning that Kurgatok has studied the arakkoa. Perhaps he can decipher the scroll's contents.Stymying the Arakkoa^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Thander^Thander^^^^Kill Ashkaz in Veil Reskk, Ayit in Veil Shienor, and Urdak in Veil Skith and return to Thander at the Allerian Stronghold.^We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers. My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them.Stymying the Arakkoa^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Rokag^Rokag^^^^Kill Ashkaz in Veil Reskk, Ayit in Veil Shienor, and Urdak in Veil Skith and return to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold.^We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers. My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them.Investigate Tuurem^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Wind Trader Lathrai^Earthbinder Tavgren^By Any Means Necessary^^What Are These Things?, What Are These Things?^Find the Sealed Box and then deliver it to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside of the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^You know, come to think of it, I do recall selling several boxes of strange and exotic engineering parts to Empoor about a month ago. I'm not sure what they'd be used for, but I know that they were delivered to Tuurem. Perhaps one or more of those boxes is still there?Survey the Land^68^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^Survey the Land^^^Sit back and enjoy the ride. Speak to Altruis when the survey is complete.^To be my eyes will require some diligence on your part. Nethrandamus will take you through the Legion camps, but you must catalog everything that you see. Even the smallest detail that you may think to be inconsequential could be useful for our purposes. Primarily, I want you to note what structures are in the camps and what comprises the camps' defenses. Nethrandamus is ready when you are, <name>. Do not be afraid, he will keep you safe from harm.Olemba Seeds^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Ros'eleth^Ros'eleth^Olemba Seeds^^^Gather 30 Olemba Seeds and return them to Ros'eleth in the Allerian Stronghold.^Aren't the trees in the forest beautiful? I've often wondered if they would survive on Azeroth. I'm hesitant to send back seedlings, though. It's a rough trip and they're much harder to transport than something like a sack of seeds. The seeds are stored in tough cones that fall from the tree's branches once they've reached maturity. If you come upon some of those cones in your travels, would you mind bringing some of the seeds back to me?Olemba Seed Oil^63^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Rakoria^Rakoria^Olemba Seed Oil^^^Bring 30 Olemba Seeds to Rakoria in Stonebreaker Hold.^The oily seeds from the forest's olemba trees could prove very valuable. I'd like to gather a larger quantity of them, press them for their oil, and then see what I can do with it. Just think, there's a whole forest full of trees out there, producing a lot of seeds that go to waste. I don't care if it turns out to be cooking oil, lamp oil, or weapon oil, I won't let it go to waste! Bring me any of the seeds that you happen to gather from the olemba cones. They're all over the place.What Are These Things?^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Earthbinder Tavgren^Jenai Starwhisper^What Are These Things?^Investigate Tuurem^^Deliver the Box of Parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are. I do know one thing though - they look dangerous! <name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold to the southeast. She may have some idea of what these are.What Are These Things?^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Earthbinder Tavgren^Tooki^What Are These Things?^Investigate Tuurem^^Deliver the Box of Parts to Tooki at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are. I do know one thing though - they look dangerous! <name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Tooki at Stonebreaker Hold to the southeast. He may have some idea of what these are.Attack on Firewing Point^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Lieutenant Meridian^Lieutenant Meridian^What Are These Things?^^^Kill 10 Firewing Defenders, 10 Firewing Bloodwarders, and 10 Firewing Warlocks. Then report back to Lieutenant Meridian at the Allerian Post in Terokkar Forest.^We know that the blood elves of Firewing Point are working for Kael'thas and Illidan. And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon. Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers. The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out! Head up to Firewing Point to the north and see to it.Attack on Firewing Point^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Sergeant Chawni^Sergeant Chawni^What Are These Things?^^^Kill 10 Firewing Defenders, 10 Firewing Bloodwarders, and 10 Firewing Warlocks. Then report back to Sergeant Chawni at Stonebreaker Camp in Terokkar Forest.^We know that the blood elves of Firewing Point are working for Kael'thas and Illidan. And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon. Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers. The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out! Head over to Firewing Point to the northeast and see to it.Unruly Neighbors^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Bertelm^Theloria Shadecloak^^^The Firewing Liaison, Thinning the Ranks^Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post.^The recent arrival of the fel orcs at the ruins to the east both puzzles and troubles Thander. They wasted no time in starting to construct fortifications and repair the buildings. The construction goes on day and night, <name>. I've dispatched one of my most reliable agents to keep watch, but we can ill afford to delay action. Move against their workers, then seek out Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post to the north of the Bonechewer Ruins. She'll give you further instructions.Buying Time^68^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^Survey the Land^^^Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you kill 2 Felguard Legionnaires, 3 Mo'arg Engineers and 8 Gan'arg Tinkerers.^As long as the transporters stand, nothing we do to the forge camps will have any permanence. We must find a way to destroy the Legion structures. I need time to devise a plan of attack. If you can keep their engineers and tinkerers busy, it would greatly slow down their progress, buying me the time I need. Stay as far away as possible from the overseers, <name>. They are extremely dangerous beings.An Unwelcome Presence^63^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Kurgatok^Shadowstalker Kaide^^^The Firewing Liaison, What Happens in Terokkar Stays in Terokk^Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Shadowstalker Kaide.^Our forces at Thrallmar thought they had the fel orcs contained in the Hellfire Citadel area, but the recent arrivals at the ruins to the east say otherwise. We can't permit them to gain a foothold here. Rokag has dispatched Shadowstalker Kaide to the ruins to keep an eye on them, but we have to do something to keep them from digging in. Go to the ruins, decimate their peons, and then look for Kaide in the trees to the north. He'll tell you where to go from there.The Master Planner^68^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^Survey the Land^^^Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you recover the Master Planner's Blueprints.^All forge camps have a master planner. The master planner dictates what types of structures are present at a forge camp and how each structure is situated. Moreover, this information is kept on a set of blueprints that the planner carries around on their person. We need the master planner's blueprints. Armed with such exacting information, we could persuade an acquaintance of mine to lend some assistance. Find the mo'arg master planner and take his blueprints. He will be stationed behind the forges.The Firewing Liaison^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Theloria Shadecloak^Theloria Shadecloak^^Unruly Neighbors^^Locate and slay Lisaile Fireweaver, then return to Theloria Shadecloak.^Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying? My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost. Kill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again.The Firewing Liaison^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Shadowstalker Kaide^Shadowstalker Kaide^^An Unwelcome Presence^^Locate and slay Lisaile Fireweaver, then return to Shadowstalker Kaide.^Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying? My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost. Kill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again.Patience and Understanding^68^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Sal'salabim^Survey the Land^^^Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand wants you to take the Master Planner's Blueprints to Sal'salabim in Shattrath City and convince him to help you.^Take the blueprints and travel to Shattrath City in the Terokkar forest. Once at Shattrath, go to the Lower City and look for a mo'arg by the name Sal'salabim. He'll probably be at the bar, drinking away his sorrows. By the way, you may need to convince him to lend his assistance. Try to approach him with patience and understanding. If that does not work, use your fists.Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Jenai Starwhisper^Earthbinder Tavgren^^The Final Code^^Speak with Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^<name>, after you're done celebrating here, I think that you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren. I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there.Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know^63^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Tooki^Earthbinder Tavgren^^The Final Code^^Speak with Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.^<name>, I think that after you're done celebrating here, you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren. I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there.Thinning the Ranks^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Theloria Shadecloak^Theloria Shadecloak^^Unruly Neighbors^^Kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers and return to Theloria Shadecloak.^Knowing Thander and Bertelm, they won't tolerate such a large buildup of hostile forces on our doorstep. Asking them to dispatch members of the garrison to participate in an attack on the camp isn't an option either. It would just leave us too vulnerable to attack. It falls to us to do what we can to diminish the threat the fel orc buildup poses. Kill what you can of their forces and I will look for ways to stall any reinforcements.What Happens in Terokkar Stays in Terokkar^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Shadowstalker Kaide^Shadowstalker Kaide^^An Unwelcome Presence^^Shadowstalker Kaide wants you to kill 10 Bonechewer Devastators and 6 Bonechewer Backbreakers.^If word reaches Thrallmar that they've failed to contain the fel orcs, we're going to be receiving a lot of company down here. Frankly, I'm not sure I want all that attention, so we're going to keep this little problem under wraps, got it? If we can inflict enough casualties on the fel orcs, chances are their presence will never come to the attention of anyone outside Stonebreaker. So, let's end it now. Wade in there, swing your weapon, wave your hands, or whatever it is you do - just kill fel orcs.Crackin' Some Skulls^68^All^Terokkar Forest^Sal'salabim^Sal'salabim^Survey the Land^^^Sal'salabim at Shattrath City wants you to recover Raliq's Debt, Coosh'coosh's Debt and Floon's Debt.^<Sal'salabim laughs.> This Sal'salabim design. <Sal'salabim points to the architecture and formations on the blueprints.> Look at towers. Demon hunter no can see, yes? Poor, poor Altruis. He cry if he had eyes, yes? Yes, Sal'salabim help but first you help Sal'salabim. <Sal'salabim gives you a ledger.> These creatures owe Sal'salabim golds. Many golds. Go collect for Sal'salabim and come back. They no give you Sal'salabim gold easy. Have to fight, but you strong. You defeat Sal'salabim!It's Just That Easy?^68^All^Terokkar Forest^Sal'salabim^Altruis the Sufferer^Survey the Land^^^Sal'salabim at Shattrath City wants you to return to Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand.^<Sal'salabim points to the blueprint.> You see where fel cannons are? <Sal'salabim draws an arrow denoting a change of direction.> You turn fel cannon around and use on structures. Wait! Don't be mad! One thing you not know. Overseers have key to turn cannons. You need key first! One from each overseer! Not so easy, eh? Take information back to Altruis.Forge Camp: Annihilated^68^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^Survey the Land^^A Visit With the Greatmother, Against the Legion^Altruis the Sufferer in western Nagrand has asked that you Destroy Forge Camp: Hate and Destroy Forge Camp: Fear.^Gather your allies, <name>. You will need them if you are to face an overseer. Once you have a suitable group, find and kill the overseers at each camp. Take their keys and use them to turn and fire the fel cannons upon the camps. Return to me once the camps are destroyed.Fel Orc Plans^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Fel Orc Plans^Bertelm^^^^Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point. Why would the two forces be working together? Bertelm might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to the Allerian Stronghold and show him the map.An Unseen Hand^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Fel Orc Plans^Rokag^^^^Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point. Why would the two forces be working together? Rokag might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to Stonebreaker Hold and show him the map.Timber Worg Tails^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Bertelm^Bertelm^Timber Worg Tails^^^Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold wants you to bring him 12 Timber Worg Tails. The tails can come from either Timber Worgs or Timber Worg Alphas.^Have you come across the timber worgs in your travels? I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat. They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory. It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help?Strained Supplies^64^All^Shattrath City^Sha'nir^Sha'nir^^^More Venom Sacs^Bring 8 Dreadfang Venom Sacs to Sha'nir in Shattrath City.^More and more refugees come through the gates of Shattrath City each day. Some have sustained such injuries, it's a real wonder they made it here. I can deal with most of the conventional injuries; my training as an Aldor healer has prepared me for that. Poison wounds are more problematic as my anti-venom supplies have begun to run low. Bring me venom sacs from the local dreadfang spiders so I can produce more antidotes. You'll find a pocket of the spiders in the southeastern region of Terokkar.Vestments of the Wolf Spirit^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Malukaz^Malukaz^Vestments of the Wolf Spirit^^^Bring 12 Timber Worg Pelts to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold.^Generations ago, when orc clans still called Terokkar Forest home, the wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they had no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind. In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest. I believe I can bring the wolf spirit back to his ancestral home, just as we orcs have returned. The ritual will require me to create vestments from the pelts of the wolves of the forest to guide the spirit back to its home.A Cure for Zahlia^64^All^Shattrath City^Sha'nir^Sha'nir^^^^Bring Stonegazer's Blood to Sha'nir in Shattrath City.^The woman to my right suffered a severe injury to the head. She survived, but lost her eyesight. A traditional cure used among my people requires the blood of a very old basilisk. Unfortunately, due to poaching from various groups, Terokkar basilisks don't tend to live very long. There is one basilisk whose name I've known since I was a youngling. It is known only as "Stonegazer" and it's rumored to live east of here, near the land's edge. Bring me its blood so that Zahlia may see once again.Restoring the Light^64^All^Shattrath City^Ishanah^Ishanah^^^^Ishanah wants you to go to the Arakkoa outpost east of Shattrath City and use the Blessed Vial to cleanse the Eastern Altar, the Western Altar and the Northern Altar.^Much of this region was inhabited by draenei long ago. We Aldor were charged with the safeguarding of our holy sites and altars. Many of them have since been destroyed or taken over by our enemies. To the east of here there is an arakkoa outpost. It was purposefully built on the location of three of our sacred altars. The arakkoa use their foul magic to warp and defile the innate power of our shrines. Take this to the arakkoa outpost and use it to cleanse the three altars.The Elusive Ironjaw^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Bertelm^Bertelm^Timber Worg Tails^^^Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold.^Now that I have the fur I'll need for the trim, I've been thinking that the pelt of a particular wolf would make a good hood for my cloak. Imagine seeing your enemy clad in the pelt of the most cunning predator in the forest! I've tried trapping old Ironjaw without success. I've tried cornering him, outsmarting him, and baiting him. None of it has worked. He stalks the northeastern reaches of the forest, and I'd gladly reward you if you could succeed where I have failed.Patriarch Ironjaw^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Malukaz^Malukaz^Vestments of the Wolf Spirit^^^Bring Ironjaw's Pelt to Malukaz at Stonebreaker Hold.^You've done well in gathering the first pelts. The final piece of the vestments requires a pelt unlike any other. There is one particular wolf, an old and cunning one, that has earned his place as the patriarch of the forest wolves. He is known among them as Ironjaw, the mighty hunter. In my visions, I have seen him wandering the northeastern region of the forest. Including his pelt in the vestments will surely light the wolf spirit's path. Do not mourn Ironjaw. He will be well honored.Voren'thal's Visions^65^All^Shattrath City^Arcanist Adyria^Arcanist Adyria^^^More Basilisk Eyes^Bring 8 Dampscale Basilisk Eyes to Arcanist Adyria in Shattrath City.^Our leader, Voren'thal the Seer, was once a close advisor to Kael'thas. His prophetic visions warned him that Kael's path would lead to the destruction of our race. The visions are usually vague and unfocused, but our alchemists have devised an elixir to help him focus his clairvoyance. Unfortunately, this elixir calls for a rare ingredient: basilisk eyes. My usual source, this pathetic ethereal, has failed me. Seek the dampscale basilisks in the rocky regions of Terokkar and bring me their eyes.Magical Disturbances^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Andarl^Andarl^^^^Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold wants you to kill 10 Warp Stalkers.^It's embarrassing to admit this, but something has happened to me here in Terokkar Forest that hasn't occurred since my apprentice days. Occasionally, my spells will fizzle when I know I've done everything correctly. I almost drove myself crazy the first time it happened. I think I've found the cause. The forest is full of creatures called warp stalkers, demonic creatures with an affinity for magic and a habit of disturbing magical flows. The best way to deal with them is simply to kill them.Magical Disturbances^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Kurgatok^Kurgatok^^^^Kill 10 Warp Stalkers and return to Kurgatok at Stonebreaker Hold.^There's nothing more annoying than preparing to cast a spell, only to have it interrupted by some unseen force. After the fourth time, I knew it couldn't be coincidence and I sent Keb'ezil out to investigate. I guarantee you'll never encounter an imp that talks back more than Keb. Anyway, he managed to find the source of the problem, a pesky creature known as a warp stalker. They have a habit of disturbing the magical energy wherever they blink into existence. I've had enough of their interference.Vessels of Power^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Ros'eleth^Ros'eleth^Olemba Seeds^^^Bring 8 Draenei Vessels to Ros'eleth at the Allerian Stronghold.^Amid the ruins of Tuurem are a number of vessels containing raw, magical energy. We are fortunate that the Broken who have overrun the city are ignorant to the resource in their midst, but we cannot assume they will remain so forever. With those vessels and their power in hand, the scattered survivors of my people can resist the lure of demonic magic. Every quel'dorei we can save from our prince's folly is one more that can help us regain our lost glory. Bring me these vessels, <class>.Recover the Bones^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Soolaveen^Ramdor the Mad^Recover the Bones^The Tomb of Lights^^Collect 10 Restless Bones. Deliver them to Ramdor the Mad, just off the western side of the Ring of Observance in Auchindoun, which is in the middle of the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest.^The bones of the dead draenei litter the Bone Wastes from the explosion of Auchindoun. Their spirits are restless, and cannot move on to the next life. <class>, you must help me to recover their bones and take them to their final resting place! Only then will they be at peace; only then will they know comfort. Gather up the restless bones with care and deliver them to Ramdor the Mad at Auchindoun in the center of the Bone Wastes. Despite his name, he will know how to care for them.Helping the Lost Find Their Way^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Ramdor the Mad^Soolaveen^Recover the Bones^^^Destroy 10 Lost Spirits and 10 Broken Skeletons, and then speak with Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest.^Many spirits of the draenei were corrupted by the explosion of Auchindoun. Now they wander the wastes in torment. <name>, I beseech you to put them to rest. Destroy the lost spirits and broken skeletons that haunt the Bone Wastes beyond Auchindoun's walls. What? You think leaving them to wander in blind agony would be better? Afterward, return to Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan and tell him of that which you have done.Wanted: Bonelashers Dead!^65^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Wanted Poster^Taela Everstride^Wanted: Bonelashers Dead!^^^Kill 20 Bonelashers and then report to Taela Everstride at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^A bounty is declared on the bonelashers of the Bone Wastes. As known carriers of the plague, they are to be destroyed forthwith! While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at Carrion Hill in the north. Report to Taela Everstride afterward to collect your reward.Wanted: Bonelashers Dead!^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Wanted Poster^Mawg Grimshot^Wanted: Bonelashers Dead!^^^Kill 20 Bonelashers and then report to Mawg Grimshot at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^The bonelashers of the Bone Wastes bit Mawg and made him sick. Now he wants all of them destroyed! While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at Carrion Hill in the north. Return to Mawg Grimshot after you've done the deed and he'll give you a good reward.Torgos!^65^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Taela Everstride^Taela Everstride^Wanted: Bonelashers Dead!^^^Call down Torgos with Trachela's Carcass. Acquire a Tail Feather of Torgos and return it to Taela Everstride at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^There's a creature in the Bone Wastes so fearsome that only the dauntless dare to stalk him. I speak of Torgos, king of the bonelashers, who circles over Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes. Too bad that there's an arakkoan scarecrow there, known as Torgos's Bane, which keeps him at bay. I'd bet if you laid his mate Trachela's carcass at the foot of that scarecrow he'd come down anyway. She can be found at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes. Bring me one of Torgos's tail feathers.Torgos!^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Mawg Grimshot^Mawg Grimshot^Wanted: Bonelashers Dead!^^^Call down Torgos with Trachela's Carcass. Acquire a Tail Feather of Torgos and return it to Mawg Grimshot at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^I want Torgos, king of the bonelashers, dead! Not long ago, while I was out hunting at Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes, he fell upon me. <Mawg taps his eyepatch.> He took my eye, and now I would have his life! Bring me one of his tail feathers as proof and I'll give you a worthy reward. You'll need his mate Trachela's carcass though to call him down as he's deathly afraid of the old arakkoan scarecrow known as Torgos's Bane. Find her at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes.Rather Be Fishin'^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Seth^Seth^^^^Bring 8 Pristine Shimmerscale Eels to Seth in Shattrath City.^Speaking of lakes, there's a lake with real good fishin' up to the northeast. I used to go up there with my friends, but my mom won't let me go anymore. She says it's too dangerous, but I haven't seen anything up there but a few little spiders. Like spiders can do anything to you... My favorites were always the eels that live up there. If you're going to be up by the lake, would you think about bringing back some of the eels? They're feisty but once you subdue 'em, you can bring 'em back no problem.Speak with Private Weeks^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Lieutenant Gravelhammer^Private Weeks^Speak with Private Weeks^^^Speak with Private Weeks near the north entrance to Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.^A report's just come in from one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village. He says that a shadowy band has moved into the ruins there. <name>, I want you to speak with Private Weeks and see how you can assist him to figure out what this unknown group is up to. Just head west past Stonebreaker Hold. His last report puts his position near the north entrance to the village.Speak with Scout Neftis^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Advisor Faila^Scout Neftis^Speak with Scout Neftis^^^Speak with Scout Neftis near the south entrance to Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.^I am informed that one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village is currently observing a shadowy band that has recently moved in there. <name>, I want you to speak with Scout Neftis and see how you can assist her in figuring out what this unknown group is up to. Just head south out of here, and then due west, skirting the north of the Bone Wastes. Her last report puts her position near the southern entrance to the village.Who Are They?^65^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Private Weeks^Private Weeks^Speak with Private Weeks^^^While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor. Then return to Private Weeks at Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.^I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile! I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor. Just watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another.Who Are They?^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Scout Neftis^Scout Neftis^Speak with Scout Neftis^^^While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor. Then return to Scout Neftis at Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.^I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile! I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor. Just watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another.Kill the Shadow Council!^65^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Private Weeks^Lieutenant Gravelhammer^Speak with Private Weeks^^^Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to Lieutenant Gravelhammer at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^What! Those guys are Shadow Council?! <name>, you have to go back in there and waste them! I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can. After you're done with that, report back to Lieutenant Gravelhammer at the Allerian Stronghold. Good luck, <class>!Kill the Shadow Council!^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Scout Neftis^Advisor Faila^Speak with Scout Neftis^^^Kill 10 Shadowy Executioners, 10 Shadowy Summoners and Shadowmaster Grieve, and then return to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^What! Those guys are Shadow Council?! <name>, you have to go back in there and waste them! I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can. After you're done with that, report back to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold. Good luck, <class>!A Visit With the Greatmother^68^Horde^Nagrand^Garrosh^Greatmother Geyah^A Visit With the Greatmother^The Totem of Kar'dash, Message to Garadar, Forge Camp: Annihilated^^Speak to Greatmother Geyah and listen to what she has to tell you.^The Greatmother has asked that I seek you out and deliver a message. She wishes to speak with you at once. My will has been sapped but make no mistake, <name>, if you anger the Greatmother, I will come down upon you with all the force that I can muster. She is in the main hall. <Garrosh points at the large building to the north.> Listen to what she has to say and do as she tells you.Material Components^68^Horde^Nagrand^Greatmother Geyah^Greatmother Geyah^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Greatmother Geyah at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you collect 1 Olemba Root, 1 Marshberry, 1 Telaari Frond and 1 Dragonspine.^Mother Kashur wishes to speak with you, <name>. Before this becomes possible, you must collect the herbs required to create a potion that will expand your mind, allowing you to commune with the spirits. You must gather Olemba root from Terokkar, marshberries from Zangarmarsh, Telaari fronds from Nagrand and dragonspine from the Blade's Edge mountains. I have written down instructions on this parchment as to the cultivation of these herbs. Return to me when you have gathered the materials.The Path of Glory^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Warp-Scryer Kryv^Warp-Scryer Kryv^The Path of Glory^^^Cleanse 8 Trampled Skeletons on the Path of Glory with Draenei Holy Water, then return to Warp-Scryer Kryv at Honor Hold.^The 'Path of Glory,' they called it. A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the Dark Portal, paved with the bones of my people. It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the Light. Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, <name>, help me in this undertaking.Unyielding Souls^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Honor Guard Wesilow^Honor Guard Wesilow^Unyielding Souls^Expedition Point^^Honor Guard Wesilow wants you to defeat 12 Unyielding Footmen, 10 Unyielding Sorcerers, and 5 Unyielding Knights at the Expedition Armory to the south.^Near the end of our invasion, the Armory to the south fell under attack by the Horde's insidious Death Knights. Those vile shades cursed the Armory's defenders - and trapped their souls between the realms of the living and the dead. Those noble souls must be set free! I beg you, <name>, end my comrades' torment, for I have not the heart to slay them myself.Escape from Firewing Point!^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Isla Starmane^Captain Auric Sunchaser^^^^Escort Isla Starmane to safety and then report to Captain Auric Sunchaser at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^Thank goodness for you! <class>, I need you to help me escape. I have information vital to the security of the Allerian Stronghold and probably all of Outland! I came here from the Cenarion Expedition on a diplomatic mission, but as you can see, they weren't very friendly. If you help me get to safety, I can assure you that you will be handsomely rewarded! We won't be able to do this on our own - you do have a group with you, right?Escape from Firewing Point!^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Isla Starmane^Advisor Faila^^^^Escort Isla Starmane to safety and then report to Advisor Faila at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^Thank goodness for you! <class>, I need you to help me escape. I have information vital to the security of Stonebreaker Hold and probably all of Outland! I came here from the Cenarion Expedition on a diplomatic mission, but as you can see, they weren't very friendly. If you help me get to safety, I can assure you that you will be handsomely rewarded! We won't be able to do this on our own - you do have a group with you, right?Waste Not, Want Not^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Dumphry^Dumphry^Waste Not, Want Not^^Laying Waste to the Unwanted^Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Dumphry at Honor Hold.^Reinforcements are great, but I don't see 'em haulin' any wagons loaded with ingots or timber. Take a look around, friend. Trees are in short supply, and the mines are overrun with Legion scum. I'm in a bad way fer supplies, and I'm makin' what substitutions I can, but it's time to start reusing what we can. The southern edge of the Path o' Glory is strewn with the ruins of siege machinery. Some pieces of 'em are still usable. Feeling up to a bit o' a salvage operation?Looking to the Leadership^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Honor Guard Wesilow^Honor Guard Wesilow^Unyielding Souls^^^Overcome the ghosts of Arch Mage Xintor and Lieutenant Commander Thalvos and return to Honor Guard Wesilow in the tower northwest of Honor Hold.^The disturbances at Expedition Armory continue, despite your best efforts. No one truly knows everything that happened there, nor exactly what binds the spirits of the fallen soldiers to the ruins. Perhaps we've been approaching this the wrong way. I've always assumed that each of the ghosts had a tie to the ruins, but what if their ties were to their leaders? Arch Mage Xintor and Lieutenant Commander Thalvos were particularly close to their men, so perhaps overcoming their ghosts will calm the rest.An Old Gift^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Father Malgor Devidicus^Father Malgor Devidicus^^^^Retrieve Mysteries of the Light and return it to Father Malgor Devidicus at Honor Hold.^<The priest's gaze slowly moves from his mug to you.> Don't you know better than to bother a man in his cups? Oh, what's the use? I suppose newcomers are a good sign. What would Turalyon think? I remember the eve of our departure, when I gave Mysteries of the Light to him. During the campaign and the ensuing years, he never forgot to read his daily passage to the men. When he left us again, he gave the book back to me. Like a fool, I believed it safe in my quarters to the south of the armory.Explorers' League, Is That Something for Gnomes?^17^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Prospector Nachlan^Clopper Wizbang^^^^Find Clopper Wizbang camped in an old turtle shell on the shore north of Blood Watch.^Babysitting! Would you believe it? They pulled me out of a promising dig and sent me along with Captain Odesyus' expedition to babysit that little gnome! I'd never heard o' a gnome wanting to become a prospector before, so I asked. Seems we are takin' gnomes now, and this particular one has a fascination with murlocs! Well, he's gone off and set up shop in an old turtle shell on the northern shore of the island. Go and have a look if you don't believe me!Talk to the Hand^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Harbinger Mikolaas^Scout Jorli^^^^Report to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest.^The Hand of Argus has established a forward base at Vindicator's Rest, but they are sorely outnumbered by both the blood elves and mutated wildlife. Without backup, their outpost is in danger of falling, and we'd have no way to keep an eye on events near the Vector Coil. Report to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest to the northwest and offer her your assistance, <name>.Cutting a Path^17^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Scout Jorli^Scout Jorli^^^^Kill 10 Enraged Ravagers and return to Scout Jorli at Vindicator's Rest.^During our mission to reconnoiter the Sunhawks and their portal, I sustained a serious wound. Scout Loryi has managed to staunch the bleeding and she's trying to figure out a way to evacuate me to Blood Watch. The problem is that we'd have to abandon our position here in order to guarantee a safe return. As soon as we leave this consecrated ground, we'll be set upon by ravagers. If you can clear some of the enraged ravagers, it might allow us to make the trip back safely.Oh, the Tangled Webs They Weave^18^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Corin^Vindicator Corin^^^^Kill 8 Mutated Tanglers and report to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest.^We don't dare abandon our post, or wander too far from Vindicator's Rest, <race>. The mutated creatures closest to the Vector Coil have been changed profoundly by energy leaking from the crystals. The mutated tanglers appear to have gained a certain degree of sentience. They've learned to create, set, and conceal vicious traps that can ensnare even the most careful warrior. We'll never be able to move against the Sunhawks if we're constantly forced to look underfoot. Attack the problem at its source, <name>.Fouled Water Spirits^19^Alliance^Bloodmyst Isle^Vindicator Corin^Vindicator Corin^^^^Kill 6 Fouled Water Spirits and return to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest.^Most of the creatures touched by the crystals' energy have been corrupted in the same ways: strange marks on their flesh, increased aggression, and small crystal shards in their bodies. However, the fouled water spirits north of here appear to be turning entirely to crystal. I've never seen anything react to the crystals this way before, when we explored the foul pool, they were particularly dangerous. We must get rid of them before the Sunhawks can exploit them as a new source of energy.Well Watcher Solanian^2^Horde^Mage^Julia Sunstriker^Well Watcher Solanian^^Mage Training^^Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^And now, I need for you to do something. Well Watcher Solanian is in need of your services. You would do well to ingratiate yourself with him. He awaits you on the exterior platform that the ramp in this chamber leads up to.Well Watcher Solanian^2^Horde^Paladin^Jesthenis Sunstriker^Well Watcher Solanian^^Paladin Training^^Speak with Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.^And now, I need for you to do something.

What we have discovered is a veritable goldmine of research notes about the crystals from the "diamond" mountain, Oshu'gun. It would seem that everything in this region carries with it some residual powder of the Oshu'gun crystals. If you find any powder while adventuring in this region, return it to me and I shall reward you with a token of my appreciation which you may use to make purchases from the quartermaster.Oshu'gun Crystal Powder^67^All^Nagrand^Chief Researcher Kartos^Chief Researcher Kartos^^^Oshu'gun Crystal Powder^Chief Researcher Kartos at Halaa wants 10 Oshu'gun Crystal Powder Samples.^This base was the primary draenei research facility for the study of naaru crystals.

Then, bring the Flaming Torch to Dumphry in Honor Hold.^Now that we've gotten our salvage operation off the ground, it's time to begin the second phase of the plan. Across the Path of Glory, the Horde still has their old blade throwers trained on us. Don't let their age fool you, <name>, they're still very dangerous. Much as we're working to reclaim what we can, we can't assume the Horde is going to dismantle their weaponry. Take this torch and burn the remaining siege equipment. I'll take no chances with Honor Hold's safety.When This Mine's a-Rockin'^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Biggums^Foreman Biggums^When This Mine's a-Rockin'^The Path of Anguish^^Kill 12 Gan'arg Sappers and return to Foreman Biggums.^The mine's been overrun by a plague of gan'arg misfits! Not only did they run all my workers out of the tunnels, but they're pounding away in there night and day! To make things worse, now I've got Danath on me back! He says he's going to take away me ale ration if I don't get this taken care of soon! None of the miners'll go in there, and the guards are busy drinking themselves silly. I'm begging you, <name>, help me here. Danath can take me dignity, but he'll never take me ale!To Meet Mother Kashur^68^Horde^Nagrand^Greatmother Geyah^Mother Kashur^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Greatmother Geyah wants you to speak with Mother Kashur.^Do not be alarmed by what you might see once the effect has taken hold! These spirits are all around us - always. The potion allows your mind to be able to understand and ultimately see the spirits. You will need to be under its influence if you are to speak with Mother Kashur. You will find her a great ways to the southwest, at the Ancestral Grounds.The Agitated Ancestors^68^Horde^Nagrand^Mother Kashur^Mother Kashur^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Mother Kashur has asked that you put to rest 8 Agitated Orc Spirits.^Do you see them walking around us? The Ancestral Grounds are normally quiet and undisturbed. As of late, the ancestral spirits have risen and are extremely agitated. Something is causing a great disturbance to the spirits. We must discover what that something could be, but first, we must put the immediate threat to rest. These ghosts that you see walking about are not truly the ancestors but a representation of their state of being. You must destroy the agitated orc spirits. Do this and return to me.A Visit With The Ancestors^68^Horde^Nagrand^Mother Kashur^Mother Kashur^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Mother Kashur at the Ancestral Grounds in Nagrand has asked that you Visit Sunspring Post, Visit Laughing Skull Ruins, Visit Garadar and Visit Bleeding Hollow Ruins.^I need for you to journey to the villages of the ancestors, <name>. Seek each one out and see if the ancestors remain. Visit Sunspring Post to the north, visit the Laughing Skull Ruins far to the north against the mountains, visit Garadar to the northeast, and finally, visit the Bleeding Hollow Ruins on the borders of Nagrand and the Terokkar Forest, to the east. Return to me once you have observed the ancestors in their homes.I Work... For the Horde!^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Megzeg Nukklebust^Megzeg Nukklebust^I Work... For the Horde!^^^Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar.^Would you believe it? These orcs hired me to help them shore up damaged fortifications and build explosives. What a dream job! It's too bad we're so short on materials, but a clever goblin like myself learns how to make do! Can you help me? I need salvaged wood and metal from the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory. Go down there and salvage, and watch out for those red-skinned orcs! When you're done, come back for big rewards!Burn It Up... For the Horde!^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Megzeg Nukklebust^Megzeg Nukklebust^I Work... For the Horde!^^^Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Eastern Alliance Cannon and the Western Alliance Cannon, and then return to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar.^I'm a lucky, lucky goblin. I get to make explosives and killing machines, knowing they'll be used immediately on important missions! Speaking of missions, I just got one from Thrallmar command: burn the Alliance cannons on the far side of the Path of Glory... the ones pointing dangerously close to Horde fortifications. Take this torch and make your way to each cannon. Fire the torch and watch the sparks fly!The Soul Devices^70^All^Shattrath City^Spy To'gun^Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown^Find Spy To'gun^^^Steal 5 Soul Devices and deliver them to Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown at the Terrace of the Light in Shattrath City.^Gah! They've been torturing me, trying to get me to tell them everything that I know. I failed - they fed the others to Hellmaw, and I was to be next. But I told them nothing! They're crazy! They're hell-bent on summoning demonic forces that they have no way of controlling! They're using special devices to make their soul shards, and their summoning, more powerful. You must steal these devices! I would join you, but I must return to Shattrath City to report to the Lower City's spymistress.The Temple of Telhamat^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Warp-Scryer Kryv^Amaan the Wise^The Path of Glory^^^Speak with Amaan the Wise at the Temple of Telhamat in western Hellfire Peninsula.^Fortunately, the Path of Glory is not the only trace of my people in these lands. To the west, a few of our holy sites survive, although some have been overrun. While Velen prepared for the journey that would lead him to Azeroth, those of us who would remain behind sought to reestablish a presence at our holy places. In the western part of the Hellfire Peninsula, you will find a small group of draenei at the Temple of Telhamat, led by Amaan the Wise. I am certain he'd be interested in meeting you.The Codex of Blood^70^All^Lower City^Field Commander Mahfuun^The Codex of Blood^Trouble at Auchindoun^^^Read from the Codex of Blood in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun.^It has been two years since the Shadow Council summoning that resulted in the explosion of this once-great mausoleum, and the formation of the Bone Wastes. Now they are at war with an unbelievably powerful force on the inside. <name>, you must make your way into the Shadow Labyrinth to determine what they are up against, and to see if it poses a threat to us. Our spies speak of their use of a forbidden book of unholy summoning, known only as the Codex of Blood. Seek your answers within its pages.Into the Heart of the Labyrinth^70^All^Shattrath City^The Codex of Blood^Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown^Trouble at Auchindoun^^^Destroy Murmur and inform Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown at the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City of the events that have transpired inside the Shadow Labyrinth.^The Shadow Council has lost control of the cosmic being that they summoned here almost two years ago! It is what caused the explosion of Auchindoun, and the creation of the Bone Wastes beyond. Known only as Murmur, it threatens to overrun the Shadow Council and break free into the outside world! With the grandmaster, and the rest of their leadership dead, you are Outland's last hope against this monstrosity! <name>, you know at the core of your being that you and your companions dare not fail!Saving the Sporeloks^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Lauranna Thar'well^Lauranna Thar'well^^The Umbrafen Tribe^^Slay 10 Marsh Dredgers and 10 Marsh Lurkers, and then return to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Ikeyen's been telling me stories about what happened to him down in those caves and I think it's just awful! You know, maybe we should do something to help out those poor sporeloks. Ikeyen says that they live there in the Funggor Cavern, but that the marsh beasts have recently invaded. Why don't you go down there and see if you can clear some of those marsh beasts out? It's just to the southwest.Brother Against Brother^69^All^Terokkar Forest^Isfar^Isfar^^^^Kill Darkweaver Syth in the Sethekk halls, then free Lakka from captivity. Return to Isfar outside the Sethekk Halls when you've completed the rescue.^The Sethekk departed Skettis with great fanfare when Auchindoun exploded. Surely it must've been an omen of our master's arrival. My brother, Syth, was one of their leaders and told us we were obligated to go into the temple ruins and face our god. After we took up residence in the ruins, calling them the Sethekk Halls, I began to doubt my brother and his ally, Ikiss. In time, Syth had me cast out of the Halls, but he refused to let me take our sister Lakka with me. Will you help me rescue her?Terokk's Legacy^69^All^Terokkar Forest^Isfar^Isfar^^^^Bring Terokk's Mask, Terokk's Quill, and the Saga of Terokk to Isfar outside the Sethekk Halls.^My people honor an ancient hero named Terokk. Arakkoa hatchlings are regaled with stories of his deeds and descriptions of his beautiful plumage. He dwelt among my people for hundreds of years, but mysteriously vanished one day, leaving only his mask, spear, and writings behind. The relics are cherished by the arakkoa, but they were heartbroken when the Sethekk bore the objects away from Skettis at their departure. I have written down what little I know about their location within the halls.The Mastermind^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Biggums^Foreman Biggums^When This Mine's a-Rockin'^^^Locate and kill Z'kral in the mines beneath Honor Hold, then report back to Foreman Biggums.^Those infernal gan'arg keep scurrying into the mine! For each one you kill, two or three more seem to take its place! There's got to be someone down there in the deepest reaches of the mine directing the incursion. You seemed to do well against them last time, and Light knows you're the only one brave enough to venture back into the mine. Find out who's responsible for this disturbance and make him pay!When Spirits Speak^68^Horde^Nagrand^Mother Kashur^K'ure^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Mother Kashur at the Ancestral Grounds in Nagrand has asked that you seek out the vision you had. Find K'ure in Oshu'gun.^Oshu'gun - the diamond mountain - was once sacred to my people. It was there that the clans would gather every year to celebrate the springtime festival. It was there that our shaman communed with the honored ancestors. It was the center of our culture - until the shadows overtook us. When the clans became a horde, the spirits of Oshu'gun fell silent. The ancestors turned their backs on us. Yet something now draws them from their rest. Venture to Oshu'gun and discover what could trouble the spirits so.A Secret Revealed^68^Horde^Nagrand^K'ure^A'dal^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Speak with A'dal in Shattrath City.^As my energies bled away over the centuries, a void slowly grew in my place - devouring the souls of those nearby. Helplessly, I watched as generations of orc souls were drawn into the vortex. Recently, my enemies harnessed the vortex and used it to draw countless void minions into their Burning Legion. Now, the key to ending this cycle and freeing the orc spirits lies with another naaru - A'dal. I have sensed his essence within the ancient city of Shattrath in the Terokkar Forest.Report to Zurai^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ranger Captain Venn'ren^Zurai^^^^Report to Zurai at Swamprat Post in Zangarmarsh.^With the arrival of Field Commander Romus and his forces, the Alliance and their draenei friends have grown bold. They're militarizing every old draenei ruin from here to Shattrath. In response, the trolls have established a new outpost in the eastern part of Zangarmarsh, just south of the Dead Mire. Swamprat Post, they're calling it. I'm glad they have a sense of humor about living in a place like that, because I wouldn't relish it. The post's commander has asked me to send anyone I can spare.Concerns About Tuurem^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Ikuti^Andarl^^^^Speak with Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^The rumors from Tuurem are unsettling. Some say the town's ruins are overrun with crazed Broken and Lost Ones, while opportunistic artifact hunters steal draenei relics. It's hard to know which are true and which aren't, but we have a responsibility to safeguard the ruins as best we can. Find Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. He is something of a student of magical relics. More than anyone else, he's likely to know what's going on there.News for Rakoria^62^All^Zangarmarsh^Shadow Hunter Denjai^Rakoria^^^^Speak with Rakoria at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^Now that Swamprat Post is complete, our control of the roads in and out of the marsh is much less tenuous. Our presence in Terokkar Forest is much less secure. Even so, at Stonebreaker Hold, Rakoria awaits word of our progress. She's sharp and capable, <name>, but be careful around her. She's got a lot of goods she's eager to move along the roads, but don't assume she's got our best interests at heart. Rakoria goes where she believes there's profit to be found.Hellfire Fortifications^60^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell^Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell^^^^Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell in Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces. We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them. To do that, we need forward staging areas. Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel. We want you to help secure these forts. Capture each fort, and then report back to me. May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, <name>, for you will no doubt clash with Horde forces eager to gain these same fortifications.Diplomatic Measures^66^Horde^Nagrand^Jorin Deadeye^Lantresor of the Blade^The Impotent Leader^^Ruthless Cunning, Armaments for Deception^Jorin Deadeye at Garadar in Nagrand has asked that you find and speak with Lantresor of the Blade in the Burning Blade Ruins.^Kilrath sends news of the Boulderfist leader: He is an orc! An ancient orc that passed through the Dark Portal in the time of our fathers and has since returned to his homeland. I wish for you to track down this orc and try to convince him to pull back the Boulderfist ogres. He resides on an upper platform in the Burning Blade Ruins to the southeast near the border of Terokkar. Good luck, <name>! Be warned, he is a blademaster...Diplomatic Measures^66^Alliance^Nagrand^Mo'mor the Breaker^Lantresor of the Blade^Do My Eyes Deceive Me^^Ruthless Cunning, Armaments for Deception^Mo'mor the Breaker at Telaar in Nagrand has asked that you find and speak with Lantresor of the Blade in the Burning Blade Ruins.^The huntress's agents send news of the Boulderfist leader: He is an orc! An ancient orc that passed through the Dark Portal in the time of our fathers and has since returned to his homeland. I wish for you to track down this orc and try to convince him to pull back the Boulderfist ogres. He resides on an upper platform in the Burning Blade Ruins to the east. Good luck, <name>! Be warned, he is a blademaster...I Must Have Them!^66^All^Nagrand^Wazat^Wazat^I Must Have Them!^^^Wazat across from Clan Watch in southern Nagrand wants you to bring him 3 Air Elemental Gases.^Do you see them?? By Gazlowe's horrific halitosis, I will have those eggs! Say, you look like you might be of some use. I'll tell you what, <race>; if you gather a few items for me to make my Jump-a-tron 4000 functional, I'll give you a key that will let you operate the machine as well! What can you do with a Jump-a-tron 4000 you say? What can't you do is more like it... I'll need air elemental gas from the air elementals of Nagrand. They're all over the place so don't ask me where to find 'em!Hellfire Fortifications^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Battlecryer Blackeye^Battlecryer Blackeye^^^^Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Battlecryer Blackeye in Thrallmar.^The fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel must be scoured from our birthland! To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel. Our outrunners found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the Alliance has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them! We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts. Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me. For the Horde!Bring Me The Egg!^66^All^Nagrand^Wazat^Wazat^I Must Have Them!^^^Wazat in Nagrand wants you to use the Jump-a-tron 4000 to get to the nest in the nearby tree and steal the Mysterious Egg.^Now that you've been initiated, I want you to get me that egg! Use the Jump-a-tron and try to hit the nest dead center. But be careful! Bodily injury or serious permanent damage may occur from a bad jump.A Personal Favor^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Wind Trader Lathrai^Wind Trader Lathrai^By Any Means Necessary^^^Retrieve 5 of Lathrai's Stolen Goods. Return them to Wind Trader Lathrai near the World's End Tavern in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.^Hmmm? A box you say? Or was it several? Do you know what material the box was constructed from? And what was the name of this merchant? Empoor? Are you certain that he's one of the Broken? I don't do much business with their kind. Perhaps my memory would be jogged if you were to do me a favor? The Skithian arakkoa - primitive casters that they are - recently stole a huge shipment of my more exotic goods. I want it all back! You can find Veil Skith just to the south of Shattrath City.The Nesingwary Safari^65^Alliance^Nagrand^"Shotgun" Jones^Hemet Nesingwary^^^^"Shotgun" Jones wants you to speak with Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Safari on the outskirts of northeast Nagrand.^"Go out and find us some supplies," he said. I was nearly killed about 15 times before I found this place! These Broken might not be the most hospitable bunch but at least they're not trying to tear my skin from my bones. Anyway, I'm not going back. My days of huntin' big game are over. If you end up heading northeast towards Zangarmarsh and run into the Nesingwary Safari, let them know that "Shotgun" quit. Hey, maybe you can take my place! Good luck, stranger.The Nesingwary Safari^65^Horde^Nagrand^Ohlorn Farstrider^Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider^^^^Ohlorn Farstrider wants you to speak with Shado 'Fitz' Farstrider at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.^These orcs have never seen a tauren before - if you can believe such a thing. If it weren't for Captain Kroghan, they would have probably been serving me for their next meal right about now. But where are my manners? I am Ohlorn Farstrider, hunter extraordinaire! I am part of the Nesingwary expedition that came up here from Azeroth in search of big game. If you are interested in the hunt, perhaps you should visit my crew at the Nesingwary Safari, due east of here near the border of Zangarmarsh.Daggerfen Deviance^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Ikuti^Ikuti^^^^Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers.^The Kurenai and the draenei don't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the Lost Ones. We are content to help the Lost Ones who seek us out, but we won't pursue them. Some draenei are intent on 'redeeming' them all. However, there are times when even the Lost Ones go too far, such as the Daggerfen. In their village to the west, they dabble in poisons and deceit, arts that come unnaturally to us. We must put an end to this before the vile Daggerfen can extend their influence.Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki^64^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Wanted Poster^Ikuti^^^^Bring Chieftain Mummaki's Totem to Ikuti at the Orebor Harborage.^Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki - leader of the foul and degenerate Lost One tribe of the Daggerfen, for his brutal attacks against the Orebor Harborage. The chieftain and his band of assassins are responsible for the deaths of numerous Kurenai and draenei and should only be approached by seasoned combatants. Travelers are advised to avoid the Daggerfen Village area to the west of the Orebor Harborage. To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to Ikuti.Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki^64^Horde^Zangarmarsh^Wanted Poster^Shadow Hunter Denjai^^^^Bring Chieftain Mummaki's Totem to Shadow Hunter Denjai.^Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki - leader of the foul and degenerate Lost One tribe of the Daggerfen, for his brutal attacks against Zabra'jin and its inhabitants. The chieftain and his band of assassins are responsible for the deaths of numerous scouts and messengers and should only be approached by seasoned combatants. Travelers are advised to avoid the Daggerfen Village area to the northwest of Zabra'jin. To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to Shadow Hunter Denjai.Message to the Daggerfen^64^All^Zangarmarsh^Shadow Hunter Denjai^Shadow Hunter Denjai^^Impending Attack^^Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers and return to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin.^Of all the Lost One tribes in Zangarmarsh, the Daggerfen are the most cunning and most aggressive. They are highly organized and make no secret of the fact that they desire control over the other Lost Ones in the marsh. Their attacks have already taken quite a toll on my scouts and messengers. I cannot afford to lose any more men. If we don't act soon, they'll have complete control over the roads and Zabra'jin will effectively be surrounded.Through the Dark Portal^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Watch Commander Relthorn Netherwane^Commander Duron^Through the Dark Portal^^^Travel through the Dark Portal and find Commander Duron. He awaits your arrival on the other side - in the Outland.^For 20 years the Dark Portal has remained a silent monument - a eulogy to a time long since forgotten. <Relthorn looks around.> I never thought to see this day, yet here we stand, looking into the abyss. On the other side of this gate we are locked in a savage war - a war that we cannot win without support. You must go through the Dark Portal and help our troops, <class>. Report to Commander Duron at once. He awaits you in Outland...Arrival in Outland^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Lieutenant General Orion^Vlagga Freyfeather^Through the Dark Portal^^^Lieutenant General Orion at the Dark Portal in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring Orion's Report to Vlagga Freyfeather.^Aided by the Alliance, my forces will hold the line here, but I need you to deliver my report to General Krakork in Thrallmar. With his help, we'll be able to drive these demons back into the abyss that spawned them! Speak to Vlagga Freyfeather who stands on the platform behind us. She'll speed you on your way.Eradicate the Burning Legion^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Sergeant Shatterskull^Through the Dark Portal^^^Speak with Sergeant Shatterskull at the Supply Caravan just outside of Thrallmar, to the east.^Though this land is full of strange new enemies, the Burning Legion is still the greatest threat to our Expedition. One of my most trusted warriors, Sergeant Shatterskull, has been studying the Legion's tactics - trying to discern the demons' true purpose in this land. Seek him out at the supply caravan just outside the southern wall. And <name> - be wary of the Legion. Their evil cannot be underestimated.Felspark Ravine^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Sergeant Shatterskull^Sergeant Shatterskull^Through the Dark Portal^^Hellfire Fortifications, Hellfire Fortifications^Sergeant Shatterskull at the Supply Caravan east of Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to kill 4 Flamewaker Imps, 6 Infernal Warbringers and 1 Dreadcaller.^Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground. They have stationed dreadlords in Felspark Ravine, east of here. They are responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion.Forward Base: Reaver's Fall^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Sergeant Shatterskull^Forward Commander To'arch^Through the Dark Portal^^Weaken the Ramparts^Report to Forward Commander To'arch at Reaver's Fall.^Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, <class>. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Maimfist's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in... Head east about 200 paces and veer south at the jutting mass of land. You'll see Reaver's Fall where an old farm used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Foward Commander To'arch. Now move out!Mission: Gateways Murketh and Shaadraz^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Forward Commander To'arch^Forward Commander To'arch^Through the Dark Portal^^^Speak with Wing Commander Brack, bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to Forward Commander To'arch at Reaver's Fall.^We've identified the two main transporters that the Burning Legion are using to bring in reinforcements: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz. If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road. I want you to bomb them both into oblivion! Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52. Now, speak with Wing Commander Brack -- he'll put you on a wyvern.Colossal Menace^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Tola'thion^Tola'thion^^^^Slay 5 Raging Colossi and then return to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^You see that huge red crystal to the north? It fell from the sky not long ago, causing a massive earthquake. When we came out here to investigate the disturbance, we found all of these colossi wandering about that weren't previously here. There's definitely something strange about that crystal and the energies that it's emanating, but I don't have time for that. Those mountain giants are my immediate concern. I want you to head up to Fallen Sky Ridge with some friends and deal with them.Crimson Crystal Clue^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Crimson Crystal Shard^Tola'thion^Crimson Crystal Clue^^^Deliver the Crimson Crystal Shard to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^As the colossus falls under the weight of your attacks, you notice for the first time that it was holding a red crystal fragment. While it was small and unnoticeable in the mountain giant's hand, it's a fairly hefty piece for you to carry around. It also suspiciously looks like it's a piece of the giant crystal in the middle of the ridge. It's most definitely a clue as to the strangeness that is occurring here, and you're sure that the druids at the Cenarion Post to the south will want to see it.Cruel's Intentions^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Nazgrel^Mission: Kill the Messenger^Doorway to the Abyss^^Kill Arazzius the Cruel, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.^Magister Bloodhawk finally deciphered the Legion missive you found earlier. It turned out to be attack plans sent by one of Highlord Kazzak's lieutenants - Arazzius the Cruel. Apparently, Arazzius commands the Legion ground forces in Hellfire. The time has come to terminate his command, <name>. Terminate with extreme prejudice. Head west to the Pools of Aggonar and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the Horde reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned.Journey to Honor Hold^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Amish Wildhammer^Marshal Isildor^Through the Dark Portal^^^Take a flight to Honor Hold and deliver Duron's Report to Marshal Isildor.^When you're ready, I'll arrange a flight straight to Honor Hold. From there, speak with Marshal Isildor and give him Duron's report. He'll be happy to see another recruit from the homelands, and I'm sure the information in that report is important stuff!The Legion Reborn^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Sergeant Altumus^The Legion Reborn^Force Commander Danath^^Speak with Sergeant Altumus at the East Supply Caravan just outside of Honor Hold, to the east.^While the Burning Legion invaded Azeroth, they were also at work here, in Outland. We have tracked their movements over the years, but this latest activity, <class> - well, this is beyond anything we've seen. Seek out Sergeant Altumus near the eastern supply caravan. She has been monitoring the invaders and may have insights into their purpose. Be swift - and take care, <name> - the Burning Legion is not to be underestimated.The Path of Anguish^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Sergeant Altumus^Sergeant Altumus^The Legion Reborn^^A Job for an Intelligent Man, When This Mine's a-Rockin'^Sergeant Altumus at the East Supply Caravan east of Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to kill 4 Flamewaker Imps, 6 Infernal Warbringers and 1 Dreadcaller.^Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground. They have stationed dreadlords at the Path of Anguish, east of here. They are the ones responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion.Expedition Point^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Sergeant Altumus^Forward Commander Kingston^The Legion Reborn^^The Longbeards, Weaken the Ramparts, Unyielding Souls, Hellfire Fortifications, Hellfire Fortifications^Report to Forward Commander Kingston at Expedition Point.^Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, <class>. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Rohamus's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in... Head east about 400 paces, across the Valley of Bones, until you run into a destroyed fel reaver. You'll see Expedition Point where a Legion base used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Forward Commander Kingston. Now move out!Disrupt Their Reinforcements^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Forward Commander Kingston^Forward Commander Kingston^The Legion Reborn^^Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gatewa^Defeat enemies around Portal Grimh and Portal Kaalez to gather Demonic Rune Stones.^You'll find the Legion front to our northeast, and spaced along it are portals used to gather reinforcements from throughout Outland. We, <name>, are going to destroy those portals! Take this primer. Designed in Area 52, it uses the demons' own power as an explosive device! Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals... then watch the fireworks!! Go, <name>, and return to me when your mission is complete.Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Forward Commander Kingston^Forward Commander Kingston^Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways^Disrupt Their Reinforcements^^Speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee, bomb Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz and then return to Forward Commander Kingston at Expedition Point.^Just west of the Dark Portal are two huge transporters: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz. If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road. I want you to bomb them both into rubble! Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52. Now, speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee -- he'll put you on a gryphon and send you on your way.Keep Thornfang Hill Clear!^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Mahuram Stouthoof^Mahuram Stouthoof^^^^Kill 8 Thornfang Ravagers and 8 Thornfang Venomspitters, and then return to Mahuram Stouthoof at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^We've been fighting an ongoing battle to keep the pass through Thornfang Hill to the west clear of ravagers. It would be bad if we were to become completely cut off from the refuge in Zangarmarsh. We don't want to displace the creatures, but there seems to be little choice as their attacks on travelers through the area have become more aggressive. Clear some of the ravagers out of there if you can.Know your Enemy^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Lieutenant Amadi^Know your Enemy^Force Commander Danath^^Speak with Lieutenant Amadi at the old guard tower just west of Honor Hold.^Rumors have surfaced that some new breed of orc is on the rise. Larger, meaner - more cunning than the brutes we're familiar with. If these rumors are true then our forces, already stretched, may be taxed beyond their limit. I have entrusted my lieutenant, Amadi, with investigating this matter. If you would help us in this dark hour, seek her out. She is stationed at the broken tower just west of the Hold. And <name> - be careful out there. You're heading into a dangerous new world.In Case of Emergency...^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^"Screaming" Screed Luckheed^"Screaming" Screed Luckheed^In Case of Emergency...^^Voidwalkers Gone Wild^Collect 30 pieces of Zeppelin Debris and bring them to "Screaming" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash.^In the event of an emergency, it's always the pilot's job to keep a level head, especially when the only orders your co-pilot follows come from his stomach. The good news is that we won't need to wait days for replacement parts to be imported. The bad news is that the "spare" parts got scattered from here to the Valley of Bones to the east. The other bad news? The spare parts aren't so spare. They, uh, fell off during our rapid descent. Could you help me collect enough to get us off the ground again?Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Forward Commander To'arch^Forward Commander To'arch^Through the Dark Portal^^Return to the Abyssal Shelf, Return to Thrallmar^Forward Commander To'arch at Reaver's Fall in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.^Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission? This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a wyvern and destroy the whole damned thing! Here are your bombs - now, talk to Wing Commander Brack when you're ready for takeoff.Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Wing Commander Gryphongar^Wing Commander Gryphongar^^Wing Commander Gryphongar^Return to the Abyssal Shelf, Go to the Front^Wing Commander Gryphongar at Shatter Point in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.^Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission? This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a gryphon and destroy the whole damned thing! Here are your bombs - now, talk to Gryphoneer Windbellow when you're ready for takeoff.Everything Will Be Alright^67^All^Auchenai Crypts^Greatfather Aldrimus^Greatfather Aldrimus^^^^Greatfather Aldrimus standing outside the Auchenai Crypts of Auchindoun has asked that you enter the Auchenai Crypts and destroy Exarch Maladaar.^You've had quite an adventure, <name>. And before you've even set foot inside of the Auchenai Crypts. I am one of the fortunate spirits. I was neither bound to Levixus nor a part of Exarch Maladaar's vile experiments in necromancy. While you have destroyed Levixus, Maladaar lives on, continuing to torment the spirits inside the crypts. What I ask is simple. Enter the Auchenai Crypts and destroy Exarch Maladaar so that the spirits trapped inside can finally rest in peace.Undercutting the Competition^66^All^Mana-Tombs^Nexus-Prince Haramad^Nexus-Prince Haramad^^^^Nexus-Prince Haramad located outside of the Mana-Tombs wants you to kill Nexus-Prince Shaffar and bring Shaffar's Wrappings back to him.^That Shaffar is a shrewd one - I'll give him that... He's managed to keep the Consortium out while he safely pillages this crypt for all it's worth. I have no faith in these imbeciles actually breaking through Shaffar's defenses so I'll make you a deal, <race>. Enter the Mana-Tombs and kill Nexus-Prince Shaffar. Bring me back his body wrap as proof of this deed and I'll reward you handsomely.Whitebark's Memory^10^Horde^Eversong Woods^Larianna Riverwind^Whitebark's Spirit^Old Whitebark's Pendant^^^Larianna Riverwind wants you to place Old Whitebark's Pendant by the runestone at the Scorched Grove.^This pendant brings back memories of a different time. A better time. Unfortunately, memories are the last thing I need right now. I want you to bury this by the runestone in the Scorched Grove. It was there that I first met the treant elder. Put my old friend's memory to rest.Auchindoun...^68^Horde^Auchenai Crypts^A'dal^D'ore^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Travel to the Auchenai Crypts in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest and slay Exarch Maladaar to free the spirit of D'ore.^Deep within the Auchenai Crypts is a tomb: A tomb unlike any that exists on this shattered realm. It was from this tomb, the first tomb, that the vast mausoleum of Auchindoun was born. You must venture to the Auchenai Crypts of Auchindoun and find this tomb. Slay the guardian of the crypt to release the captive spirit within. The spirit holds the key...What the Soul Sees^68^Horde^Nagrand^D'ore^Mother Kashur^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Locate a Soul Mirror somewhere in the Auchenai Crypts and use it to call forth a Darkened Spirit from Ancient Orc Ancestors in Nagrand. Destroy 15 Darkened Spirits so that the ancestors may rest in peace.^For several centuries, the spirits of Auchindoun coalesced into my darkened essence. Many of the catastrophes that befell this crypt were a direct result of my weakened state. Regrettably, there is nothing that can be done to stop this cycle. It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist. Your only recourse is to destroy the ancient spirits of Nagrand before they transform into creatures of the void. Use the soul mirrors found throughout this crypt to free them...Return to the Greatmother^68^Horde^Nagrand^Mother Kashur^Greatmother Geyah^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Return to Garadar and speak to Greatmother Geyah.^Return to Greatmother Geyah at Garadar with news of your victory, <name>. This will surely lift the spirits of the Mag'har. Perhaps even the young Hellscream will be lifted from his malaise.The Inconsolable Chieftain^68^Horde^Nagrand^Greatmother Geyah^Garrosh^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Greatmother Geyah at Garadar has asked that you speak with Garrosh.^You have done so much for the Mag'har, <name>. Your accomplishments are known to all, including Garrosh. Go to him now and tell him of your latest victory. Tell him that you do what you do for him and his people. Surely he will be lifted by your words.There Is No Hope^68^Horde^Nagrand^Garrosh^Greatmother Geyah^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Speak to Greatmother Geyah and tell her what Garrosh told you.^You are an honorable <race>, <name>. You have done much for the Mag'har. No one could ever deny your service to my people. Alas, the time of the Mag'har is at an end. You have shown me, more than anything, that I am unfit to lead these people. My cursed blood runs too deep. I will not... I cannot become the second Hellscream to damn the orcs. Please, <name>, return to the Greatmother and tell her what I have told you. I am too ashamed to see her... to look into her eyes.The Archmage's Staff^68^All^Netherstorm^Ravandwyr^Ravandwyr^The Archmage's Staff^^^Retrieve Archmage Vargoth's Staff from Ekkorash the Inquisitor and bring it to Ravandwyr in Area 52. To bring Ekkorash out of hiding, sprinkle the Conjuring Powder on the brazier in the center of the ruins.^Allow me to introduce myself, <class>. I am Ravandwyr, apprentice to the Archmage Vargoth. My master is... indisposed, shall we say. I am here on a matter of great importance. The Arklon Ruins southeast of the city are a hotbed of Burning Legion activity. Their purpose in the ruins concerns neither me nor my master, but their leader, Ekkorash, possesses the archmage's staff. This conjuring powder will allow you to draw the demon out of hiding. Sprinkle it on the brazier at the center of the ruins.Curse of the Violet Tower^68^All^Netherstorm^Ravandwyr^Image of Archmage Vargoth^The Archmage's Staff^^Malevolent Remnants, A Fate Worse Than Death, The Unending Invasion^Use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to make contact with Archmage Vargoth.^Now, you will be able to use the archmage's staff to contact him. He resides in the Violet Tower, on an 'island' to the southeast. The tower is both sanctuary and prison to him, cursed as it is. Kirin Tor can neither enter nor leave, keeping me apart from my master. The staff's magic can penetrate the tower's defenses, but only if invoked by one outside the Kirin Tor. Take the archmage's staff and use it to conjure his image. Tell him what has happened and that I have not completely failed him.Thrall, Son of Durotan^68^Horde^Nagrand^Greatmother Geyah^Thrall^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Venture to Orgrimmar and deliver Geyah's message to Thrall.^Return to your world, <name>. Go to my grandchild and tell him that his blood is here - on this shattered world. Tell him that his father's legacy lives on. Tell him everything...Ar'kelos the Guardian^68^All^Netherstorm^Image of Archmage Vargoth^Archmage Vargoth^The Archmage's Staff^^Finding the Keymaster^Enter the Violet Tower at the center of Kirin'Var Village and defeat Ar'kelos, then speak with Archmage Vargoth.^Now that you've gathered all the items I'll need to break Kael'thas's curse, one thing remains to be done. When Kael'thas sealed the tower, he placed an arcane golem, known as Ar'kelos, at the bottom of the tower. You must defeat Ar'kelos in order allow me to work magic within the tower again. When you enter the Violet Tower, the curse will begin to affect you. Once you have defeated Ar'kelos, ascend the tower and assist me in making preparations for the ritual.Trouble at Auchindoun^70^All^Terokkar Forest^Spymistress Mehlisah Highcrown^Field Commander Mahfuun^Trouble at Auchindoun^^^Report to Field Commander Mahfuun at the entrance to the Shadow Labyrinth at Auchindoun in Terokkar Forest.^I have spies within Auchindoun and they have been sending me disturbing reports. That place has been nothing but trouble ever since it exploded a couple of years ago. Something in there has gone horribly wrong - again - and the Shadow Council is now on a war footing. Though the reports were lacking on details, their preparations appear to be directed inward. You must make your way to the entrance of the Shadow Labyrinth. My field commander, Mahfuun, will fill you in on what needs to be done.Find Spy To'gun^70^All^Lower City^Spy Grik'tha^Spy To'gun^Find Spy To'gun^^^Locate Spy To'gun in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun.^To'gun, the fool! We're barely holding off the attacks here, and he goes back in to get more information and try to save the other spies! I don't know whether to love him or kill him! The Shadow Council must have used magic to ferret us out, because all of our spies had to get out of there in a hurry. Most of us didn't make it. Please, if you're brave enough to enter the Shadow Labyrinth, will you keep an eye peeled for To'gun? It's been a while, and I fear the worst.Can't Stay Away^69^All^Terokkar Forest^Oloraak^Isfar^^^^Speak with Isfar, who can be found near the entrance to the Sethekk Halls in Auchindoun.^I tried to persuade Isfar to remain here, in the safety of Shattrath, but he would have none of it. Instead, he's decided to venture out to Auchindoun again on his own. He was lucky enough to escape the Sethekk Halls once, but if they discover him, there won't be a second time. I admire his desire to free his sister, but he's not going to be able to do it without help. Find Isfar and have a word with him, <name>. If you can't persuade him to come back, perhaps you could help him rescue Lakka?Battle-Mage Dathric^68^All^Netherstorm^Dathric's Blade^Custodian Dieworth^^^^Locate Battle-Mage Dathric's quarters in Wizard's Row and return the blade to his weapon rack. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.^The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name "Dathric" are engraved into the weapon's pommel. Turning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring Battle-Mage Dathric's spirit to this world? Perhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last.Off To Area 52^68^All^Netherstorm^Netherologist Coppernickels^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Netherologist Coppernickels^^^Deliver the Netherologist's Notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that. This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town. Isn't this bridge great? If I could just keep this junk working. Hey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52! It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road. Why don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage? I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all!Malevolent Remnants^68^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^Malevolent Remnants^Curse of the Violet Tower^^Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to defeat 20 Severed Spirits in Kirin'Var's Town Square.^Most of the spirits in the village are little more than pale remnants of Kirin Tor mages. They retain no knowledge of their former selves and wander the ruins in blind anger. It wasn't always like this, though. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the spirits were restless, but not spiteful. With the passage of time they have only grown more aggressive. I dare not venture into the southern part of the village, for they will not spare even me. Quiet them and let us hope it will purge their anger.A Fate Worse Than Death^68^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^^Curse of the Violet Tower^^Kill 10 Mageslayers and 10 Mana Seekers and return to Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.^After the blood elves leveled Kirin'Var Village, they started the construction of a large building to the northwest. Without the expertise of the archmage, we can't say for certain what's going on there. One thing is clear, though. The blood elf activities have unleashed a tide of ravenous mana elementals on the village. They seem drawn to the ruins of Wizard Row, wreaking further destruction. We cannot permit this to continue.You're Hired!^68^All^Netherstorm^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Netherologist Coppernickels^^Invaluable Asset Zapping, Report to Engineering^Collect 10 Etherlithium Matrix Crystals and return them to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>! We're building my masterpiece out here - the X-52 Nether-Rocket! But first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it. That's where you come in. To start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix. The draenei had crystals coming out of their ears! So head north to the Ruins of Enkaat and get them for me! Nevermind all of the draenei ghosts.The Sigil of Krasus^69^All^Netherstorm^Image of Archmage Vargoth^Image of Archmage Vargoth^The Archmage's Staff^^^Retrieve the Sigil of Krasus from Spellbinder Maryana at Manaforge Coruu, northwest of the Violet Tower.^Before we departed Azeroth all those years ago, the Kirin Tor entrusted our expedition with a powerful artifact, the Sigil of Krasus. It was a great boon to us in our battle against the orcs and it could play a key role in helping me break the enchantment that imprisons me. However, when Kael'thas divested me of my possessions, he gave the sigil to Spellbinder Maryana, who remained behind with the garrison. If he truly realized what he had in his possession, he wouldn't have given it away so easily.Manaforge B'naar^68^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^Bloodgem Crystals^Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to go to the outskirts of Manaforge B'naar and retrieve the B'naar Personnel Roster from Captain Arathyn.^You may have noticed one of Kael's manaforges on your way here. You know, the large purple buildings sucking energy from the sky? We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate them. You can help our information gathering efforts by obtaining a personnel roster. Giving us an idea of who's there and what they do will prove to be invaluable information. We believe Captain Arathyn, leading a ballista team just outside of Manaforge B'naar, is in possession of one such roster. Obtain it for us.Recharging the Batteries^68^All^Netherstorm^Bot-Specialist Alley^Bot-Specialist Alley^^^^Use the Battery Recharging Blaster on enough Phase Hunters to get the Battery Recharge Level to 10. Then return it to Bot-Specialist Alley at the Ruins of Enkaat in the Netherstorm.^I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up. The phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy! You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether. Fill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy.Mark V is Alive!^68^All^Netherstorm^Maxx A. Million Mk. V^Bot-Specialist Alley^^^^Escort the Maxx A. Million Mk. V through the Ruins of Enkaat and back out to safety. Then speak with Bot-Specialist Alley just outside the Ruins of Enkaat in the Netherstorm.^Greetings, <race>. I am charged up and fully functional. There are fragile draenei machines in these ruins, which I must retrieve. I am equipped with delicate servos in my wrist actuators, and the latest in combustion-pneumatic bump soakers. Handling them with care will not be an issue. However, the ghosts that haunt these ruins will likely attack, so I will need you and your friends along for protection.Krasus's Compendium^69^All^Netherstorm^Image of Archmage Vargoth^Image of Archmage Vargoth^The Archmage's Staff^^Torching Sunfury Hold^Reclaim Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 1, Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 2, and Krasus's Compendium - Chapter 3 from Kirin'Var Village's Town Square.^The Kirin Tor sent one other of Krasus's possessions with our expedition. It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war. Before Kael'thas and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town.High Value Targets^68^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to go to Manaforge B'naar and slay 2 Sunfury Warp-Masters, 6 Sunfury Warp-Engineers and 8 Sunfury Geologists.^Based on the roster information, we know that the brains of the manaforge operations are the warp-masters and warp-engineers. It is they who oversee the retrieval of a so called "warp-energy" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes. The only other specialists in the area are geologists. Everyone else is either part of the military or a magister crony; both easily replaced. Get in there and kill Kael's specialists; that's what'll hurt him the most.Stealth Flight^68^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Veronia^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Speak to Veronia outside Area 52 and fly to Manaforge Coruu.^While you were gone, my men uncovered another one of these manaforges. It is east of here and is known as Manaforge Coruu. Two of my best spies have arranged a secret landing spot outside of the manaforge. You are to help them infiltrate Kael's forces and obtain whatever information you can. Speak to Veronia just outside the city walls; she's arranged for a windrider that will take you to Manaforge Coruu. Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn; he will brief you on your mission.A Convincing Disguise^68^All^Netherstorm^Caledis Brightdawn^Caledis Brightdawn^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Obtain a set of Sunfury Arcanist Robes, one pair of Sunfury Researcher Gloves and a Sunfury Guardsman Medallion and bring them to Caledis Brightdawn at Manaforge Coruu in Netherstorm.^Infiltrating the ranks of Kael's army will not be an easy task. With my knowledge of illusionary magic I could pass you off as one of Kael's followers, but there are certain details in their uniforms I could not replicate. Bring me a set of their robes, a pair of their gloves and a Sunfury guardsman medallion. This will make the results of my magic much more convincing.Information Gathering^68^All^Netherstorm^Caledis Brightdawn^Caledis Brightdawn^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Use the Sunfury Disguise, go into Manaforge Coruu and listen to the conversation between Commander Dawnforge and Arcanist Ardonis. Report back to Caledis Brightdawn at Manaforge Coruu after completing this task.^I've prepared a uniform with the pieces you obtained. It is magically enhanced to complete the illusion. We spotted Commander Dawnforge going in to meet Arcanist Ardonis a few minutes ago. He had a full retinue of guards with him, so whatever they're discussing is bound to be incredibly important; see if you can catch any of it. Oh, I almost forgot. You'll want to stay away from the arcane golems patrolling the manaforge. They will see right through the illusion.That Little Extra Kick^68^All^Netherstorm^Boots^Boots^Securing the Shaleskin Shale^^^Obtain 5 Nether Ray Stingers for Boots at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^So, I'm just missing the one ingredient that'll give my concoction that little extra kick that it needs. The sting of the nether rays, roaming around near the shaleskin flayers, delivers quite a punch. Bring me some of their stingers and I'll extract the venom right out of them! I'm certain the results will be explosive!Return to Thalodien^68^All^Netherstorm^Caledis Brightdawn^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Return to Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 in Netherstorm.^It would be best if this information got back to Thalodien as soon as possible. I'll stay here and cover our tracks. It wouldn't do us much good to have Kael'thas find out what we were snooping around here. Secret information is always better if your enemy doesn't know you have it.And Now, the Moment of Truth^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Rakoria^Rakoria^Olemba Seed Oil^^^Find Grek and ask him to try it on his weapon. Once he's tried out the oil, return to Rakoria with the results.^The oil is finally ready for its first test. It seems heavy enough to serve as a high quality weapon oil. The only way to find out is to have a professional try it out. See Grek over there by the wanted posters? Sure, he's no poet, but the orc knows his way around a weapon! Take a sample of the oil to him and ask him to use it on his weapon. After he's had a chance to test it out, let me know what he thinks of it.A Defector^70^All^Netherstorm^Magistrix Larynna^Magister Theledorn^Kick Them While They're Down^^^Go to Manaforge Ara and speak to Magister Theledorn.^We've recently been contacted by a Sunfury magister who wishes to join our ranks and swears he has information we're in need of. We've checked our informants to make sure he's not a double agent and he checks out. He's stationed in Manaforge Ara which makes communication difficult. Talk to him and see what he knows. If he's half as useful as he claims to be, we'll be able to put him to good use.Invaluable Asset Zapping^69^All^Netherstorm^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Lead Sapper Blastfizzle^^You're Hired!^Dr. Boom!^Use the Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to beam the Hyper Rotational Dig-A-Matic, Servo-Pneumatic Dredging Claw, Multi-Spectrum Terrain Analyzer, and the Big Wagon Full of Explosives back to Area 52. Then report to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle at the eastern end of the fissure that runs through Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^See the fissure running through Area 52? We did that! It's yielding up all sorts of goodies for the X-52 Nether-Rocket, but we're running short on equipment. We had an operation at the Arklon Ruins to the southeast until the Burning Legion moved in. I need you to take this Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to the ruins. Use it to beam our gear back to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle down in the fissure. Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>, this is your chance for that promotion. Don't blow it!Bloodgem Crystals^68^All^Netherstorm^Magistrix Larynna^Magistrix Larynna^^Manaforge B'naar^^Magistrix Larynna wants you to go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain a Bloodgem Shard from a Sunfury Magister. Use this shard near the larger Bloodgem crystals and return to her at Area 52.^Kael's magisters have refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds. They do this by attuning smaller bloodgem crystal shards to larger, fully charged ones. Go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain one of these shards from a Sunfury magister and use it to siphon energy from one of the larger crystals. Return to me so that I may study the effects of the aura. Do not worry; any side effects should be temporary.Warp-Raider Nesaad^69^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Warp-Raider Nesaad^A Heap of Ethereals^^Kill Warp-Raider Nesaad and then return to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^Warp-Raider Nesaad must be dealt with! I have no idea how he survived my attack, but he cannot be allowed to continue his operation out there. Go back and take out Nesaad. He keeps a small ethereal camp near the southwestern corner of the Heap. Don't fail like I did, <class>.Pick Your Part^68^All^Netherstorm^Papa Wheeler^Papa Wheeler^^Consortium Crystal Collection^In A Scrap With The Legion, Help Mama Wheeler^Collect 10 pieces of Ethereal Technology and return them to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^Those ethereal clowns are as opportunistic as us, I'll give them that. But no one, and I mean NO ONE, moves in on a B.O.O.M. claim! The Heap to the south is ours! If we're to finish the X-52 Nether-Rocket, we're going to need all of the new tech that we can get our hands on. And since the ethereals are stealing from us, I think it's only fair that we repay them in kind. Why don't you head down there and see if you can acquire some of their technology out from under their noses!Disrupt Their Reinforcements^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Forward Commander To'arch^Forward Commander To'arch^Through the Dark Portal^^^Defeat enemies around Portal Xilus and Portal Kruul to gather Demonic Rune Stones.^Directly east of here is the Legion Front. Spaced across the front are infernal portals and gateways, used to bring reinforcements to Hellfire Peninsula and throughout Outland. We're going to destroy those portals! Take these primers. Designed in Area 52, they use the demons' own power as an explosive! Defeat Legion forces around Portals Xilus and Kruul to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate four stones inside the portals, and watch! Return to me when your mission is complete.Summoner Kanthin's Prize^69^All^Netherstorm^Image of Archmage Vargoth^Image of Archmage Vargoth^The Archmage's Staff^^^Defeat Summoner Kanthin at Manaforge Duro, on the island to the north of Sunfury Hold, and reclaim the Stone of Glacius from him.^The next thing we must do is reclaim my familiar, Glacius, from the blood elf summoner who holds it captive. Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var. It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy. I'm certain that Kanthin, fool that he is, has tried to compel Glacius to serve him. My scrying has revealed that Kanthin is now stationed at 'Manaforge Duro,' if that terminology has any meaning for you.A'dal^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Haggard War Veteran^A'dal^^^City of Light^Speak to A'dal, the leader of the Sha'tar, in the center of the Terrace of Light.^Welcome to Shattrath City, <class>. This might be the one place in all of Outland where you'll find any semblance of safety. A group of naaru known as the Sha'tar drove the demons away from here. If you've never met a naaru, you ought to see A'dal inside the Terrace of Light. The leader of the Sha'tar is an awe-inspiring sight if I ever saw one. Sure is a change of pace from anything else in this bleak land.City of Light^65^All^Shattrath City^Khadgar^Khadgar^^A'dal^Allegiance to the Aldor, Allegiance to the Scryers^Follow Khadgar's servant and listen to its story. Return to Khadgar after completing this task.^Do not burden A'dal with petty inquisitions, <class>. That just might be the most powerful being you ever come face to face with. You do not look familiar. I suppose you want to learn about the city? You'll have to excuse me if I don't give you a tour myself, but I'm a bit busy discussing strategy with A'dal. Perhaps you'll find a summoned servant acceptable in my stead? Excellent!Hero of the Mag'har^68^Horde^Nagrand^Thrall^Greatmother Geyah^A Visit With the Greatmother^^^Return to Greatmother Geyah at Garadar in Nagrand.^I must set things in order before I leave. Return to the Greatmother and tell her that her grandson comes.Investigate the Crash^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Grelag^"Screaming" Screed Luckheed^A Hasty Departure^^^Search for crash survivors.^When I was wounded in the wastes I saw a goblin zeppelin crash. It went down to the northwest, beyond the Expedition Armory. The zeppelin was on fire. Shrieking, burning goblins were falling like bombs from the sky. Of course I was in a lot of pain and I had lost a lot of blood. I may have imagined the whole thing. If you can find any survivors, we can offer them sanctuary here at Spinebreaker Post.Safety Is Job One^66^All^Mana-Tombs^Artificer Morphalius^Ethereal Transporter Control Panel^^^Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off^Artificer Morphalius wants you to kill 10 Ethereal Crypt Raiders, 5 Ethereal Sorcerers, 5 Nexus Stalkers and 5 Ethereal Spellbinders.^Shaffar's ethereals have completely blocked us out of the Mana-Tombs. Thankfully, I've got a plan. While we can't go in through the front door, there are sure to be several transporters inside. I want you to clear the way for my crew first and then I want you to activate one of their transporters to teleport us inside. Activate the teleporter in the chamber right before Shaffar's chambers when the way has been cleared. Don't worry, I'll make it worth your while...Someone Else's Hard Work Pays Off^66^All^Mana-Tombs^Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen^Nexus-Prince Haramad^^Safety Is Job One^^Escort Cryo-Engineer Sha'heen safely through the Mana-Tombs so that he can gather the ether held inside Shaffar's ether collectors.^Who were you expecting!? That idiot Morphalius was 'de-prioritized.' Now I'm here to clean up his mess. All I need from you is to watch my back as I go through Shaffar's ether gatherers and suck them dry of all that they have collected. If I successfully complete my mission, Haramad himself will reward you! What do you say? Escort me through the Mana-Tombs and then collect some incredible treasure? You already did most of the work anyway! Nothing's alive back behind us, right?Make Them Listen^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Emissary Mordiba^Emissary Mordiba^^^^Mordiba wants you to defeat 12 Unyielding Footmen, 8 Unyielding Knights, and 6 Unyielding Sorcerers at the Expedition Armory to the west of Spinebreaker Post.^I was sent here to make contact with the Unyielding spirits. These once proud Alliance soldiers were defeated long ago, and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins to the west. If they would only join us we would gain a powerful ally. Imagine, a legion of undying warriors to use against our enemies. But these undead are mad with hatred and will not listen to me. Perhaps they can be forced to join us.Dr. Boom!^68^All^Netherstorm^Lead Sapper Blastfizzle^Lead Sapper Blastfizzle^^Invaluable Asset Zapping^^Kill Dr. Boom and return with the good news to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^<name>, my former protege, Sparky Uberthruster, wouldn't wear his helmet while down here and one day transformed into the infamous Dr. Boom! And he stole off to the northeast with most of our sapping equipment! He and his Boom Bots have been a menace to Area 52 ever since. I need you to go to his Camp of Boom just outside of town and put an end to him! Use these Boom's Doom bombs to take him out. And make sure not to get too close to him or his Boom Bots!The Sunfury Garrison^69^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^The Sunfury Garrison^^^Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill 10 Sunfury Archers.^After Prince Kael'thas's forces destroyed the village and imprisoned the archmage in the Violet Tower, they withdrew to Sunfury Hold to the northeast. The very men who destroyed our village and slew our fellows toast their 'amazing victory' while we are helpless to avenge the fallen. We must not allow these crimes to go unanswered! Be the instrument of our vengeance, <name>. Go to Sunfury Hold and claim the lives of those responsible for this crime.Down With Daellis^69^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^The Sunfury Garrison^^^Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill Master Daellis Dawnstrike.^I'll never forget the blood elf who led the attack. He wore a tabard with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor. He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf officers would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many Kirin Tor mages that day, but he didn't linger long at Sunfury Hold. Kael'thas has ordered him to Manaforge Duro to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, <name>, and silence his bow for good.Essence for the Engines^68^All^Netherstorm^Chief Engineer Trep^Chief Engineer Trep^Report to Engineering^^^Collect 7 Mana Wraith Essences and return them to Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^As the X-52's chief of engineering, I have to see to it that the nether-rocket's main engines are in tip-top shape. Unfortunately, I haven't built them yet. <class>, I'm in dire straits here! I have almost all of the parts. All that I'm missing is the engine core. Luckily for us, I think we can make use of the essence from the local mana wraiths to jump-start the engines. They can be found near most of the glowing trenches in the northern part of the island. Except for here in Area 52, of course.Report to Engineering^68^All^Netherstorm^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Chief Engineer Trep^Report to Engineering^You're Hired!^^Deliver the Etherlithium Matrix Crystals to Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^<name>! I need you to take all of these etherlithium crystals over to Chief Engineer Trep, my, uh, chief of engineering. He should know what to do with them. And if he doesn't, you see to it that he finds out!Elemental Power Extraction^68^All^Netherstorm^Chief Engineer Trep^Chief Engineer Trep^Report to Engineering^^^Extract 5 Elemental Power for Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^Darn it, that didn't do it! Ok, I've got another idea! I had Xyrol whip up an elemental power extractor. I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it. The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines! The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them.I See Dead Draenei^67^All^Terokkar Forest^Ha'lei^Ramdor the Mad^I See Dead Draenei^^^Speak to Ramdor the Mad, standing on the bone pile outside of the Auchenai Crypts.^I see dead draenei. They're all around us. Bah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me. <Ha'lei points to Ramdor.> He believes me, though... He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it! It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up! You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest.Ezekiel^67^All^Shattrath City^Ramdor the Mad^Ezekiel^I See Dead Draenei^^^Find and speak with Ezekiel of Shattrath in Shattrath City.^I believe that the dead, which we have been caring for these last 500 odd years, should be left alone. Maladaar has other plans. He has retreated to the Crypt of Remembrance to start his experiments... Necromancy. I hope you weren't thinking about going in there... Not before helping me out so that these damned spirits will finally leave me alone. I know where they keep their treasures, <race>. Got your attention, eh? Bring me the book of the dead, held by the Aldor, Ezekiel of Shattrath.Decipher the Tome^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^A Mysterious Tome^Althen the Historian^Decipher the Tome^^^Take the Mysterious Tome to Althen the Historian in Spinebreaker Post.^This tome appears to be some sort of history written in a secret Alliance cipher. Althen, the historian in Spinebreaker Post, has studied the Unyielding for some time; he may be able to crack the Alliance code and decipher the book.The Battle Horn^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Althen the Historian^Althen the Historian^Decipher the Tome^^^Take the Unyielding Battle Horn from Lieutenant Commander Thalvos and bring it to Althen the Historian in Spinebreaker Post.^Perhaps we have taken the wrong approach to the Unyielding? The tome tells me the Expedition Armory was destroyed by orcs and death knights long ago. The Unyielding remain here as vengeful spirits trapped in an eternal battle against the fel orc clans. They think only of revenge. We must arrange for them to defeat their most hated enemies. Enter the Expedition Armory once again and find Lieutenant Commander Thalvos. He carries a battle horn that can summon the Unyielding. Bring it to me.What Book? I Don't See Any Book.^67^All^Shattrath City^Ezekiel^"Dirty" Larry^I See Dead Draenei^^^Ezekiel said the book has been stolen. Your best bet is to find the Ruffians and see if they have any information.^Ramdor? Hrm, let me think... Ramdor... Oh yes, the death priest. What does he want with the book? Well it doesn't matter. Yes I lied to you and no I don't have the book. Not anymore, anyway. It was stolen. Probably by one of those filthy refugees. Besides, Auchindoun is now defunct. We have no use for the book. If you find it, you can keep it. Like I said, I saw some of those ruffians snooping around the terrace last week. Start your search with them. They're probably playing dice in the slums.In A Scrap With The Legion^69^All^Netherstorm^Papa Wheeler^Papa Wheeler^^Pick Your Part^^Kill 5 Mo'arg Doomsmiths and 15 Gan'arg Engineers. Then return to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^The Burning Legion has moved in on our claim at the Scrap Field down the path and across the bridge to the east. This could be a huge problem for us! With the Legion at the Arklon Ruins, and now there, it's starting to look bad for us - and the rocket project - here at Area 52. <name>, I need you to go out there and deal with those demons! I'd do it, but I'm a lover, not a fighter. Yep, this is going to be trouble, I can feel it!Torching Sunfury Hold^69^All^Netherstorm^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^^Krasus's Compendium^^Using a Flaming Torch, destroy 4 Sunfury Ballistas and 4 Sunfury Tents and return to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran at Kirin'Var Village.^Ridding Sunfury Hold of its garrison is not sufficient to keep the blood elves from reoccupying it. Kael'thas's followers are zealous and tenacious. Leaving them anything to use at Sunfury is effectively an invitation to return. No, it must all be destroyed. See to it that their tents and artillery burn to ashes! <The ghost's fists clench.> Steal torches from the Sunfury flamekeepers to accomplish your task, <name>.One Demon's Trash...^69^All^Netherstorm^Mama Wheeler^Mama Wheeler^Help Mama Wheeler^^^Gather 10 Fel Reaver Parts and return them to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.^You look like a capable young <man/woman>! I was wondering if you could lend me a hand? To the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into. It's full of huge fel reaver parts. There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about. I want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts!Declawing Doomclaw^69^All^Netherstorm^Mama Wheeler^Mama Wheeler^Help Mama Wheeler^^^Obtain Doomclaw's Hand and deliver it to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.^You know what might just discourage them? Take out their leader! It seems to work everywhere else from what I've heard. And when they see a <grizzled /tough> <class>, such as yourself take out their leader... why, I bet they'll tuck tail and run for the hills! Get back in there and take out the big one they call Doomclaw. I hear he keeps himself in the eastern part of the Scrap Field underneath the pipe. Bring me his claw, too! Maybe we can make use of it.Outland Sucks!^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Razelcraz^Foreman Razelcraz^Outland Sucks!^^^Find 6 Shredder Parts and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.^I can't believe I left Booty Bay to come to Outland. My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine. How am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time? My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs. They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there.Warn Area 52!^69^All^Netherstorm^Mama Wheeler^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Help Mama Wheeler^^^Deliver the bad news to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^<name>, you have to get word back to Area 52 immediately! Hurry! Tell the rocket-chief that the Burning Legion is after us now!How to Serve Goblins^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Razelcraz^Foreman Razelcraz^Outland Sucks!^^^Rescue Manni, Moh and Jakk from the Fel Orc camps and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.^Why would fel orcs steal my shredder parts? I hate them so much. They just sneak into my camp here and take things all the time. A couple of days ago they stole three of my peons! Now the rest of my peons have run off because they are afraid they are going to be eaten by fel orcs. I can't run a mine without peons. If you could save the peons that I lost maybe the others would come back. The fel orcs have their camps along the wall to the southwest.Potential Energy Source^69^All^Netherstorm^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^The Unending Invasion^^^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran at Kirin'Var Village wants you to capture 10 Energy Isolation Cubes from the blood elf operations at Manaforge Coruu.^We are not the only ones battling the influx of the mana beings. The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why. Whatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping. Instead, I've seen them employ a variety of methods to kill the creatures. The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy. Capture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself.Building a Perimeter^69^All^Netherstorm^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^The Unending Invasion^^^Use the Rune Activation Device near the East Rune, Northeast Rune, and West Rune. The runes can be found around the perimeter of Kirin'Var Village's Wizard Row and Town Square districts. Return to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran once you've completed the task.^We are prepared to try to construct a perimeter around the village using the energy source taken from the blood elves. I can't guarantee that it will work, but we have to attempt it. Otherwise, the mana creatures will surely continue devouring the spirits of the fallen Kirin Tor. Use this device at the small runes around the perimeter of town to release the energy there. If I've woven the field correctly, we should start noticing a difference once you've used the device at each point.Distraction at Manaforge B'naar^68^All^Netherstorm^Exarch Orelis^Exarch Orelis^Assist Exarch Orelis^^^Slay 8 Sunfury Magisters and 8 Sunfury Bloodwarders and return to Exarch Orelis at Area 52.^We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate the manaforges that Kael'thas' army is operating here. Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action. We can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work. Prove your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the Sunfury magisters and bloodwarders that guard Manaforge B'naar.Spinebreaker Post^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Zelana^Apothecary Albreck^^Apothecary Zelana^Boiling Blood^Apothecary Zelana at Reaver's Fall wants you to speak with Wing Commander Brack to take a wyvern to Spinebreaker Post, and then bring the Bleeding Hollow Blood Sample to Apothecary Albreck at Spinebreaker Post.^<name>, my equipment here is, unfortunately, not configured for all the tests I'd like to perform. However, my colleague at Spinebreaker Post, Apothecary Albreck, possesses the required implements. I have acquired a sample of Bleeding Hollow blood -- gained from a past mission of Thrallmar's agents. Take the sample to Albreck and allow him to study it. To reach Spinebreaker Post, speak with Wing Commander Brack, near the wyverns to the south.Naaru Technology^68^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^B'naar Control Console^Naaru Technology^^^Go inside Manaforge B'naar and find the B'naar Control Console.^The Scryers obtained a personnel roster for Manaforge B'naar and are now having a field day picking out assassination targets. They've missed one small bit of information, scribbled on the side of the roster. It appeared to be a password or code like those used to access naaru-made technology like the Exodar or Tempest Keep. Go inside the manaforge and look for a control panel. Copy its readouts on this scroll as well as you can. We must confirm our suspicions about the origin of the technology.B'naar Console Transcription^68^All^Netherstorm^B'naar Control Console^Anchorite Karja^Naaru Technology^^^Deliver the B'naar Console Transcription to Anchorite Karja at Area 52 in Netherstorm.^You try to transcribe the shapes as you see them flash across your eyes. The results are less than exact, but should serve as adequate evidence to prove or disprove the Aldor's suspicions.Attack on Manaforge Coruu^68^All^Netherstorm^Exarch Orelis^Exarch Orelis^^Measuring Warp Energies^^Travel to Manaforge Coruu and slay 8 Sunfury Arcanists and 5 Sunfury Researchers. Return to Exarch Orelis when you've completed this task.^Your success at Manaforge B'naar was quite noteworthy. I'm sure that Anchorite Karja will ask you for a repeat performance at Manaforge Coruu next. We've learned of a particularly important regiment of Sunfury arcanists and researchers being deployed there and I would like you to target them. Succeed and you will deliver a crushing blow against our enemy's forces.Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.^69^All^Netherstorm^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.^Help Mama Wheeler^^^Speak with Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at the Proving Grounds in Netherstorm.^On the outskirts of town to the east are the Proving Grounds. Our top experimentalist, Doctor Vomisa, has been toying with a combination of fel reaver, ethereal, and of course, goblin technologies there. This is in no small part thanks to your gathering efforts Junior Technician 3rd Grade, <name>! Go to him; I know that he'll have a solution for saving Area 52. And since he's likely to use you as a test subject, if I were you, I'd bring some friends along just in case.You, Robot^69^All^Netherstorm^Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.^Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.^Help Mama Wheeler^^^Activate the Scrap Reaver X6000 Controller and test out its capabilities. Then give your feedback to Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T at the Proving Grounds in the Netherstorm. Deal with any problems that arise.^Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at your service. Here, take this controller. I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin. Just stay nearby! The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function. Try out everything... I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run.Back to the Chief!^69^All^Netherstorm^Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T.^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Help Mama Wheeler^^^Report to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm immediately!^I'm certain that the rocket-chief is going to want to have a word or two with you! If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate to get back to Area 52 and speak with him!Bloody Vengeance^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Althen the Historian^Althen the Historian^Decipher the Tome^^^Blow the Unyielding Battle Horn near the Alliance Banner. Kill Urtrak and then return to Althen the Historian at Spinebreaker Post.^East of here is an old destroyed Alliance siege tower. Now scavengers loot it for old nails and bits of scrap. Long ago, many Alliance warriors lost their lives at this tower and their banner was captured by Urtrak, a foul orc commander. Blow the Unyielding battle horn near the Alliance banner. This will get the attention of Urtrak. It may also summon forth warriors who fell in battle long ago.The Master's Grand Design?^67^All^Nagrand^"Dirty" Larry^Nitrin the Learned^I See Dead Draenei^^^Find Nitrin the Learned at the Abandoned Armory in Nagrand.^A couple of draenei paid us a visit last night. They'd somehow learned that we had the book in our possession and made a very generous offer to "take it off our hands." We didn't ask them what they wanted with the book but the young one kept talking about "the master's grand design," whatever that means. Look, I don't ask questions when money is in play. They gave us a lot of gold and we gave them the book. He said that they lived in Nagrand - in the old Abandoned Armory, north of Telaar.Vision of the Dead^67^All^Nagrand^Nitrin the Learned^Nitrin the Learned^I See Dead Draenei^^^Nitrin at the Abandoned Armory in Nagrand wants you to bring him 1 Mountain Gronn Eyeball, 1 Flawless Greater Windroc Beak, and 1 Aged Clefthoof Blubber.^It has already begun. Levixus stands atop the ruins of Auchindoun and reads from the book of the dead. He calls the dead out by name and, through demonic ritual, binds the tortured souls to his will. He will raise all of Auchindoun if given the chance! But... you must first prepare. You cannot do battle with that which you cannot see. <Nitrin hands you a parchment.> Bring me the items I require to brew the tincture. It will open your mind and allow you to see into the spirit world.Levixus the Soul Caller^67^All^Terokkar Forest^Nitrin the Learned^Ramdor the Mad^I See Dead Draenei^^^Destroy Levixus and take the Book of the Dead from his possession.^Go now, <name>. You will find Levixus on the uppermost ruins of Auchindoun. Enter there from the southern reaches of the Bone Wastes. He stands amidst a storm of souls... Destroy him and take the book of the dead. Once you have the cursed book in your possession, destroy it! Destroy it so that such an atrocity can never again be made possible.Force Commander Danath^60^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Marshal Isildor^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Through the Dark Portal^^The Legion Reborn, Know your Enemy^Marshal Isildor wants you to report to Force Commander Danath Trollbane in Honor Hold.^<Marshal Isildor spits in the dust.> Well, time to earn your pay. Report at once to Force Commander Trollbane within the keep. He and his advisors will no doubt be heartened to see you. <Marshal Isildor salutes you stoically.> For the Alliance!Testing the Antidote^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Thiah Redmane^Thiah Redmane^Helping the Cenarion Post^^^Use the Cenarion Antidote on a Hulking Helboar and observe the results. Once you have the results of the experiment, return to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind! It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do. Ridding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species.Testing the Antidote^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Thiah Redmane^Thiah Redmane^Helping the Cenarion Post^^^Use the Cenarion Antidote on a Hulking Helboar and observe the results. Once you have the results of the experiment, return to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind! It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do. Ridding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species.Capturing the Keystone^70^All^Netherstorm^Archmage Vargoth^Archmage Vargoth^Finding the Keymaster^^^Venture into Tempest Keep's Botanica and retrieve the Keystone from Commander Sarannis. Bring it to Archmage Vargoth at the Violet Tower.^It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton. In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone. Only once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom.Honor the Fallen^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Althen the Historian^Commander Hogarth^Decipher the Tome^^^Report to Commander Hogarth in the Expedition Armory.^Hogarth, the commander of the Armory, is in the eastern tower. You must report your victory over Urtrak to him. Perhaps he will be friendly? Of course he may try to consume your soul. One can never tell with spirits such as these. The Unyielding are still against us and will no doubt kill you if they can. Be careful <name>.Wanted: Annihilator Servo!^68^All^Netherstorm^Wanted Poster^Papa Wheeler^^^^Obtain an Annihilator Servo and deliver it to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^WANTED: 1 Annihilator Servo to replace the failing one in my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer. You and your friends might want to check with the blood elves at Manaforge B'naar to the west to see if they have any spares. They seem to have a few arcane annihilators roaming about. Please deliver the servo in pristine condition to Papa Wheeler at Area 52.A Heap of Ethereals^68^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Assisting the Consortium^^Warp-Raider Nesaad, Another Heap of Ethereals^Collect 10 Zaxxis Insignias and return them to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^There is something else that I want your help with. A group of ethereals, known as the Zaxxis, have cut their relationship with the Consortium and gone into business for themselves. They've even cut deals with the Sunfury blood elves. This will not be tolerated! I infiltrated their group at the Heap to the south. But after I took out their leader, I had to escape here to Area 52. <class>, go down there and bring back their insignias. Of course, not all wear them because they're cowards.Assisting the Consortium^68^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Assisting the Consortium^^Consortium Crystal Collection^Speak with Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things. Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured. There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals. As a representative of the Aldor, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can.Assisting the Consortium^68^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Assisting the Consortium^^Consortium Crystal Collection^Speak with Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things. Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured. There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals. As a representative of the Scryers, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can.Consortium Crystal Collection^69^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Assisting the Consortium^^Pick Your Part^Obtain an Arklon Crystal Artifact and return it to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^Our leader, Nexus-Prince Haramad, has tasked me with the acquisition of a crystal artifact from the Arklon Ruins to the southeast. They're old draenei ruins. Unfortunately for both myself and the goblins here, the Burning Legion has decided to move in to perform their own excavation. If you're willing to help me, go to the ruins and take the crystal artifact from the dreadlord named Pentatharon.Request for Assistance^69^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Khay'ji^Gahruj^Warp-Raider Nesaad^^^Seek out and offer your services to Gahruj. He is located at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.^While you were at the Arklon Ruins, I received a request for assistance from one of our representatives out in the field. It would appear that the Consortium is having some 'difficulties' in trying to recover property from the blood elves, which they refuse to pay for. Please head east out of Area 52 and cross the bridge to the next island over. You'll find my associate, Gahruj, at the Midrealm Post, just inside of Eco-Dome Midrealm.Rightful Repossession^69^All^Netherstorm^Gahruj^Gahruj^Warp-Raider Nesaad^^^Collect 10 Boxes of Surveying Equipment and return them to Gahruj at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.^Our business relations with the blood elves appear to be at an end. A few weeks ago a large shipment of surveying equipment was delivered to them at Manaforge Duro. They have refused to pay for it. <name>, I would ask that you pay the blood elves of Manaforge Duro to the east a visit. They appear to be having some trouble with an infestation of mana creatures there, so take advantage of their preoccupation. I care not what happens to them, but I would very much like to see the return of our property.An Audience with the Prince^69^All^Netherstorm^Gahruj^Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad^Warp-Raider Nesaad^^^Deliver the Surveying Equipment to the Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.^Nexus-Prince Haramad has conveyed to me that he is interested in the immediate return of this property to him personally. I would greatly appreciate if you would deliver it in my stead. It is a great honor to gain an audience with the nexus-prince, and I am sure that he would be keenly interested in hearing the tales of your adventures here in the Netherstorm. Seek out his chamber atop the Stormspire to the north. He is often present as a holographic image, which you may address.Triangulation Point One^69^All^Netherstorm^Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad^Dealer Hazzin^Warp-Raider Nesaad^^^Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the first triangulation point. Once you have found it, report the location to Dealer Hazzin at the Protectorate Watchpost on the Manaforge Ultris island in the Netherstorm.^There is another reason for the retrieval of the surveying equipment. There is a crystal from draenei legend of great importance to me. It is said that the crystal bestows god-like powers to its bearer! But it is in danger of being unearthed by others - namely the Burning Legion. <name>, take the equipment and use it to find the first triangulation point. We know it to be somewhere to the east near Manaforge Ultris. Afterward, check-in with my agent, Dealer Hazzin, on the Manaforge Ultris island.A Not-So-Modest Proposal^70^All^Netherstorm^Wind Trader Marid^Image of Wind Trader Marid^A Not-So-Modest Proposal^^^Retrieve the Teleporter Power Pack and bring it to the Ethereal Teleport Pad on the Celestial Ridge to the east of Manaforge Ultris. Activate the pad and give the Teleporter Power Pack to the Image of Wind Trader Marid so he can install it.^From the look on your face, I can tell you're a <race> who appreciates a good profit. I've built a reputation as a dealer in exotic goods, and I'm about to launch a new venture. I need a reliable subcontractor to procure the goods from the Celestial Ridge. First, you'll need to re-energize a teleport pad. There is a spare power pack in Access Shaft Zeon, which is on the south side of Manaforge UItris. The Protectorate is operating in there, so you may be able to follow their tracers to your goal.Getting Down to Business^70^All^Netherstorm^Image of Wind Trader Marid^Shrouded Figure^A Not-So-Modest Proposal^^^Gather 8 Nether Dragon Essence, then return to the Ethereal Teleport Pad area. Nether Dragon Essence may be obtained from Nether Drakes or Nether Dragons.^As you've no doubt seen, the area is teeming with nether dragons in various stages of growth. All nether dragons, young and old, contain an essence that's highly desired by K -- err, by a client of mine. Most people aren't willing to risk their lives to gather it, so we've got the place to ourselves. You can start by gathering the essence from any of the creatures out here, but it's imperative that we start building a supply right away. Return to me once you have the first batch.A Promising Start^70^All^Netherstorm^Tyri^Tyri^A Not-So-Modest Proposal^^^Gather 15 Nether Dragonkin Eggs, then return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.^We've come here to investigate rumors of a strange breed of dragons, perhaps even descendents of Deathwing himself. These are clearly not ordinary black dragons, though. We'll know more once we've had a chance to examine their eggs. Their hatred for my flight runs deep, so I can't get close enough to gather the eggs. Will you agree to help?Troublesome Distractions^70^All^Netherstorm^Tyri^Tyri^A Not-So-Modest Proposal^^^Speak with Wind Trader Marid and lure him away from his trading post. Deal with him and then return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.^Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down. We've been able to evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe. If your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him.Securing the Celestial Ridge^70^All^Netherstorm^Tyri^Tyri^A Not-So-Modest Proposal^^^Use the Challenge of the Blue Flight to provoke Veraku on the southern edge of the Celestial Ridge. Defeat him and return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.^The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor. There is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight. If we can displace the leader of these drakes, Veraku, with a show of dominance, we can cow the rest of them into submission.Triangulation Point Two^70^All^Netherstorm^Dealer Hazzin^Wind Trader Tuluman^Warp-Raider Nesaad^^^Use the Triangulation Device to point your way toward the second triangulation point. Once you have found it, report the location to Wind Trader Tuluman at Tuluman's Landing, just on the other side of the bridge from the Manaforge Ara island in the Netherstorm.^I've recalibrated the triangulation device with the information that you provided from the first point. You'll use it in exactly the same manner to discover the second. All that I can tell you is that the second point is somewhere far to the west. Once you've located it, speak with Wind Trader Tuluman; another of the nexus-prince's agents. He's posing as a weapon merchant at a small trading post next to the bridge, which leads to the island that Manaforge Ara is on.Full Triangle^70^All^Netherstorm^Wind Trader Tuluman^Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad^Warp-Raider Nesaad^^Special Delivery to Shattrath City^Recover the Ata'mal Crystal and deliver it to the Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.^With the data from both the first and second points, I'm now certain that the crystal is at the top of the Ruins of Farahlon to the northeast. Unfortunately, the data indicates that the crystal is moving, which means that it has already been discovered, probably by the Burning Legion! Just in case, I recommend that you take some friends along. Slay the demon that has the crystal and return it to Nexus-Prince Haramad.The Caverns of Time^68^All^Caverns of Time^Andormu^Andormu^To The Master's Lair^^Old Hillsbrad^Andormu at the Caverns of Time has asked that you follow the Custodian of Time around the cavern.^Greetings, <name>. Please follow the custodian. She will make things a bit more... clear.The Warp Rifts^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ogath the Mad^Ogath the Mad^The Warp Rifts^^^Use the Unstable Warp Rift Generator in the Warp Fields. Gather 3 Warp Nethers from Unstable Voidwalkers and return them to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.^Long have I wandered through Outland, searching for the truth of the void. Now I am old and weak. Perhaps you will help me? I must learn the secrets of the voidwalkers. You must find the Warp Fields to the west. West of the Expedition Armory there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak. Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift. You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through.To The Master's Lair^66^ ^Caverns of Time^Steward of Time^Andormu^To The Master's Lair^^^Speak to Andormu at the Caverns of Time.^Ah, <name>. We have been expecting you. Please, allow one of my brothers to fly you down to the master. He awaits you below...Special Delivery to Shattrath City^70^All^Shattrath City^Image of Nexus-Prince Haramad^A'dal^Special Delivery to Shattrath City^Full Triangle^^Deliver the Ata'mal Crystal to A'dal on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.^I am an ethereal of my word, <name>. You have truly inspired me. I am now going to give you the ata'mal crystal to hand over to the naaru. As it was your heroics that made this possible, I wish for you to deliver it. You may use my personal teleporter to go directly to Shattrath City. Simply step through it and you will be transported there. Give the crystal to the naaru known as A'dal on the Terrace of Light. May the trade winds be at your back.Formal Introductions^70^All^Netherstorm^Shrouded Figure^Tyri^A Not-So-Modest Proposal^^^Find Tyri at the north end of the Celestial Ridge and speak with her.^Greetings, <name>. Do not be alarmed. This is merely a projection of my current form. It's the only way my companion and I could keep watch without revealing ourselves. The ethereal who approached you, Marid, is little better than a swindler in the guise of a legitimate merchant. I'd like you to consider working with me instead. My purpose out here is to find out more about the unusual dragonkin on this ridge. Meet me at the north end of the ridge and we will discuss this further.Old Hillsbrad^68^All^Caverns of Time^Andormu^Erozion^Old Hillsbrad^The Caverns of Time^^Andormu at the Caverns of Time has asked that you venture to Old Hillsbrad and speak with Erozion.^To the west is the timeway to Hillsbrad of the past - 7 years to be exact. Forces are working against the Horde warchief, Thrall, attempting to prevent him from ever escaping Durnholde Keep. If Thrall never escapes, this world - as you know it - will cease to exist. Gather a group of adventurers and take the timeway to old Hillsbrad. Two of our agents await you inside. Speak with Erozion on the other side.Taretha's Diversion^68^All^Caverns of Time^Erozion^Thrall^Old Hillsbrad^^^Travel to Durnholde Keep and set 5 incendiary charges at the barrels located inside each of the internment lodges using the Pack of Incendiary Bombs given to you by Erozion.^Taretha was integral in Thrall's survival and upbringing and instrumental in shaping Thrall's life. It was Taretha who created the original diversion at Durnholde, allowing Thrall to escape. Now the Infinite have captured Taretha and hold her at Tarren Mill. The diversion will not happen without our involvement. You must use the incendiary devices that I give you and burn down the internment lodges in Durnholde. When you have done this, speak with young Thrall in the basement prison of Durnholde.Escape from Durnholde^68^All^Caverns of Time^Thrall^Erozion^Old Hillsbrad^^^When you are ready to proceed, let Thrall know. Follow Thrall out of Durnholde Keep and help him free Taretha and fulfill his destiny.^You look upon me now and see only a boy, but in my heart and soul I hide my dreams. I have plans for my people, stranger. One day, they shall overthrow their oppressors and rise as one. They will break free from the bonds that hold them and from that uprising shall be born the orcish Horde. I promise you, stranger, should we make it out of here alive, when I have the means to reward this selfless deed, I will seek you out... I will find you. <Thrall nods.> We will leave when you are ready.Return to Andormu^68^All^Caverns of Time^Erozion^Andormu^Old Hillsbrad^^The Black Morass^Return to the child Andormu at the Caverns of Time in the Tanaris desert.^This timeline has been restored and the assault of the Infinite Dragonflight upon Hillsbrad has been quashed. Return to Andormu at once. He awaits your arrival in the master's lair.Arelion's Secret^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Magistrix Carinda^Magister Aledis^Arelion's Journal^^^Magistrix Carinda wants you to interrogate Magister Aledis, last seen traveling from Falcon Watch to Zangarmarsh.^Arelion's journal does not deal with any sort of scholarly studies. It details his escapades with a young female blood elf! How could I've been such a fool? Unfortunately, the floozy's identity is not revealed in this journal. Aledis, a colleague of Arelion's, was his best friend and confidant. Go question him and find out who he was having this affair with. I saw Aledis leave Falcon Watch for Zangarmarsh. Follow the road headed north from town; it'll eventually lead west, toward Zangarmarsh.The Mistress Revealed^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Magister Aledis^Magistrix Carinda^Arelion's Journal^^^Return to Magistrix Carinda at Falcon Watch in Hellfire Peninsula.^I'm Arelion's friend, but I'm not going to take the beating of my life for him. His mistress is Viera Sunwhisper. Go tell that harpy of a wife of his. What's she going to do anyway?Arrival in Outland^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Commander Duron^Amish Wildhammer^Through the Dark Portal^^^Commander Duron at the Dark Portal in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring Duron's Report to Amish Wildhammer.^I want you to speak with Amish Wildhammer, standing about 30 paces south of us, and catch the first flight to Honor Hold. When you arrive at Honor Hold, you'll be greeted by Marshal Isildor. I have prepared a report detailing our situation here. Give him the report, and tell him you're ready for duty. You have your orders, soldier, now move out! And though your blood must be burning to help us against the fiends below, waste no time here. Honor Hold needs you even more.Journey to Thrallmar^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Vlagga Freyfeather^General Krakork^Through the Dark Portal^^^Take Vlagga Freyfeather's Wind Rider to Thrallmar. Bring Orion's Report to General Krakork.^When you're ready, I'll summon a wyvern to fly you to Thrallmar. Once you arrive, deliver Orion's report to General Krakork. Lok'tar ogar, <name> - good luck.In Search of Farahlite^70^All^Netherstorm^Zuben Elgenubi^Zuben Elgenubi^In Search of Farahlite^^^Gather 4 pieces of Raw Farahlite and return to Zuben Elgenubi at the Stormspire.^To the northeast is an area called the Netherstone, a landmark not seen when this was a lush, green land. Newly-exposed crystal formations have shown us a mineral we've called farahlite in honor of this land's former identity. The tiny amount of farahlite we've mined has already proven popular with our clients. The highest grade of the mineral comes not from static deposits, but from the giants around the Netherstone. I can offer you a cut of the profits if you'll help supply the higher grade farahlite.Report to Nazgrel^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^General Krakork^Nazgrel^Through the Dark Portal^^^General Krakork in Thrallmar wants you to speak with Nazgrel.^Though our warriors are without peer, our hold on this wasteland is still tenuous. Report to Nazgrel inside the barracks - he has need of agents... such as you. If we can't protect our holdings here, we'll be of no use to anyone. Now go!Hitting the Motherlode^69^All^Netherstorm^Zuben Elgenubi^Zuben Elgenubi^In Search of Farahlite^^^Zuben Elgenubi at the Stormspire wants you to obtain a Farahlite Core.^Now that we've got a good baseline product, we're going to need something of higher quality. Certainly the farahlite we've gathered so far is nice, but I know there's better out there. We'll have to get a sample directly from Cragskaar, the patriarch of the Farahlon giants! You should be able to find it among the other giants in the Netherstone area. It's got huge pieces of farahlite jutting from its back and that's exactly what we need. Fell the giant and collect a farahlite core from it.Void Ridge^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ogath the Mad^Ogath the Mad^The Warp Rifts^^^Go to Void Ridge and kill the creatures you find. Collect 40 Void Ridge Soul Shards and return them to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.^We have to improve my warp rift generator. You must take it to Void Ridge. Head east of here. You must avoid the foul fort of Zeth'Gor. To the east beyond Zeth'Gor is a small pass through the mountains. Through this pass you will find Void Ridge, a terrible place on the edge of the abyss. You must kill the walkers that you find there, and bring me shards of their souls. With their power we will improve upon the warp rift generator and open a portal to the beyond that cannot be closed.From the Abyss^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Ogath the Mad^Ogath the Mad^The Warp Rifts^^^Kill Void Baron Galaxis and collect his soul shard. Take the shard to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.^My warp rift generator is complete. You can now use it to summon a true prince of the void, a creature whose soul shard will tell us much of what lies beyond. Go south in Void Ridge and use my warp rift generator near the void stones. Look for a cluster of crystals near the edge of the abyss. A huge warp rift will form and Void Baron Galaxis will surely appear. Destroy this creature and bring me his soul shard.The Black Morass^70^All^Caverns of Time^Andormu^Sa'at^The Black Morass^Return to Andormu^^Travel through the Caverns of Time to the Black Morass during the opening of the Dark Portal and speak with Sa'at.^The Infinite Dragonflight have abandoned all pretense of subtlety. They plot to destroy the Guardian, Medivh, and prevent the Dark Portal from ever opening. While outwardly, this may appear a boon to the forces of the Alliance, it is in actuality catastrophic and will result in your world ending. You must venture through the timeway leading to the Black Morass. Go west and then south, past my future self, until you reach the tunnel that houses the swamp specimens. Cross over and speak with Sa'at.The Opening of the Dark Portal^70^All^Caverns of Time^Sa'at^Sa'at^The Black Morass^^^Sa'at inside the Black Morass of the Caverns of Time has tasked you with defending Medivh until he succeeds in opening the Dark Portal.^Beyond this timeway, in the heart of the Black Morass, the Guardian, Medivh, feverishly works to open the Dark Portal, heralding in the age of orcs upon Azeroth. The Infinite have sent their rift lords to stop this from happening. Scattered across the morass, rifts will materialize. Infinite will pour out of the rifts and attempt to destroy Medivh's shields and, ultimately, Medivh. Kill their rift lords and leaders! Do this until Medivh succeeds. Use this chrono-beacon should you require aid.Hero of the Brood^70^All^Caverns of Time^Sa'at^Andormu^The Black Morass^^^Return to the child, Andormu, at the Caverns of Time in the Tanaris desert.^Return to the child, Andormu, <name>. He awaits you outside this pocket of time, in the master's lair. I hear flutterings. The Scale of Sands has shown interest in your abilities. Perhaps they too would like to speak with you.Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar^68^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Anchorite Karja^Naaru Technology^^^Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis. Use it at the Manaforge B'naar console to shut it down and report back to Anchorite Karja.^We cannot shut down the manaforges by force as we'd risk causing an explosion that would shake Outland to the core. According to your transcription, there is an emergency shutdown that permanently disables the technology - a safety mechanism common in naaru constructs. To perform this procedure you will have to obtain a crystal that will allow you to communicate with the console. This access crystal is in the possession of an overseer called Theredis according to our information.Rebuilding the Staff^69^All^Netherstorm^Ravandwyr^Ravandwyr^The Archmage's Staff^^^Obtain 4 Flawless Crystal Shards from the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins and return them to Ravandwyr at Area 52.^<Ravandwyr inspects the staff, noting that part of the headpiece seems to be missing.> Simply barbaric! Ekkorash must've taken the staff's crystalline headpiece for use in some other trinket, not realizing that it works in concert with the rest of the staff. As long as it remains broken, the staff's power is greatly diminished. With a suitable draenei crystal, I should be able to repair it. I've heard the goblins remarking about the crystals carried by the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins to the north.Unlocking the Compendium^69^All^Netherstorm^Image of Archmage Vargoth^Image of Archmage Vargoth^The Archmage's Staff^^^Obtain the Heliotrope Oculus from Spellreaver Marathelle at Sunfury Hold.^While I'm glad to have most of Krasus's Compendium back, it's useless without the heliotrope oculus. You see, Krasus was well aware of the sheer power of the spells recorded in the book and took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes. Only a knowledgeable mage can use the oculus to unlock the compendium's secrets. During Kael'thas's attack, one of his lieutenants, Spellreaver Marathelle, looted it and took it to Sunfury Hold northeast of the tower. No doubt she thought it a pretty little bauble.Volatile Mutations^2^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^Botanist Taerix^^Botanical Legwork^Kill 8 Volatile Mutations, then return to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^The irradiated power cores from the Exodar have been wreaking havoc on the environment here. The most obvious effect has been the appearance of the strange creatures that seem to have sprung up near them. There may be something we can do to help them, but now, their sheer numbers are becoming too much for us to handle. I'd like you to go out and cull their numbers somewhat, and perhaps I'll have another idea after giving it some thought.The Blood Elves^4^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Tolaan^Tolaan^The Missing Scout^^^Kill 10 Blood Elf Scouts then return to Tolaan in the Shadow Ridge of Ammen Vale.^You must eliminate... the blood elf... threat. Find out... what they're... up to! They're on the... ridge behind me.Vindicator Aldar^4^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Botanist Taerix^Vindicator Aldar^Vindicator Aldar^Healing the Lake^^Speak with Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.^With your help, we were able to find a solution to our problems faster than I could have hoped. I don't have any other work for you to do. My apprentices and I can handle the rest. You should go speak with Vindicator Aldar on the other side of the ship.Abjurist Belmara^69^All^Netherstorm^Belmara's Tome^Custodian Dieworth^^^^Locate Abjurist Belmara's quarters in Wizard Row and return the book to its Bookshelf. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.^This worn, sturdy tome is no spellbook, as you might expect a Kirin Tor mage to carry. The pages of the volume are covered with hand-copied stories, accompanied by colorful illustrations. The tome seems to be far older than its former owner and may have even been a family heirloom. A powerful tie to the book may have been the last thread tying Belmara's spirit to the ruins of Kirin'Var. Returning it to its proper place on the bookshelf in her quarters might help appease her restless spirit.Conjurer Luminrath^69^All^Netherstorm^Luminrath's Mantle^Custodian Dieworth^^^^Locate Conjurer Luminrath's quarters in Wizard Row and return the mantle to his Dresser. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.^The cloak, undoubtedly of high elven craftsmanship, is richly tailored, even by the standards of the Kirin Tor. The symbols and characters sewn into the cloak's fabric hold no meaning for you, but clearly imbue the garment with magical properties. Perhaps this object binds the spirit of its former owner to this plane of existence. If so, returning it to the dresser in Conjurer Luminrath's quarters might break the spirit's link to this world, allowing it to rest.Cohlien Frostweaver^69^All^Netherstorm^Cohlien's Cap^Custodian Dieworth^^^^Locate Cohlien Frostweaver's quarters in Wizard Row and return the hat to his Footlocker. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.^Looking at the hat, you find yourself asking if any Kirin Tor mage would own such headgear. Judging from the hat's wear, it seems the gnome wouldn't go anywhere without it. You try on the hat momentarily, discovering no magical properties beyond a faint urge to dance. The treasured possession might be the source of the dead mage's bond to the village. Placing the hat in the footlocker in Cohlien's quarters might free his spirit.It's a Fel Reaver, But with Heart^68^All^Netherstorm^N. D. Meancamp^N. D. Meancamp^^^^Recover the Heart of the Fel Reaver and deliver it to N. D. Meancamp at The Heap in the Netherstorm.^You see that scrapped fel reaver over there to the south? Isn't it a thing of beauty? I want its heart! What? Yes, of course it has a heart... what doesn't? <N. D. looks indignant for a moment.> Go on over there, pry it open, bring back what I want and I'll give you a nice finder's fee in return. Oh, and I'd take a friend or two along if I were you. These Zaxxis ethereals are a pretty mean bunch! Take this fel zapper to jumpstart its heart when you're ready to begin.Sabotage the Warp-Gate!^70^All^Netherstorm^Drijya^Gahruj^Drijya Needs Your Help^^^Escort Drijya to the warp-gate at Invasion Point: Destroyer, and see to it that he is kept safe while he attempts to sabotage it. Then speak to Gahruj at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.^With the Burning Legion nearby at the fel reaver scrap field, we must do what we can to stop the flow of demons into the area. They have a warp-gate to the south in an area that they've cleverly named Invasion Point: Destroyer. I need you to go with me to the site and keep me safe while I sabotage it. Afterward, go to the Midrealm Post to the north inside Eco-Dome Midrealm and apprise Gahruj of our success. We're going to need a friend or two of yours along to help with this.Drijya Needs Your Help^70^All^Netherstorm^Gahruj^Drijya^Drijya Needs Your Help^^^Speak with Drijya near Invasion Point: Destroyer in the Netherstorm.^<class>, it is good to see a helpful face around here. The Burning Legion at the nearby fel reaver heap has become more bold, and I am beginning to fear for our safety here. The demons are constantly receiving reinforcements from Invasion Point: Destroyer to the south. My compatriot, Drijya, has gone down there to scout and see if he can do something about the Burning Legion's warp-gate. Please find and assist him in any way that you can.The Annals of Kirin'Var^69^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^Malevolent Remnants^^^Retrieve the Annals of Kirin'Var from the town hall of Kirin'Var Village and return it to Custodian Dieworth.^Silencing the spirits has not bled them of their aggression as we had hoped it would. The malevolent spirits you subdued have reemerged in the streets of the town. We must uncover what is causing this to happen. The destruction of Kirin'Var was just the beginning, or else the spirits would have been quieted by now. The town hall in the southern section of Kirin'Var maintained a logbook of all the residents. Last I heard, it was in the keeping of Battle-Mage Dathric. Perhaps his spirit still has it.Measuring Warp Energies^68^All^Netherstorm^Exarch Orelis^Exarch Orelis^Assist Exarch Orelis^^Attack on Manaforge Coruu, Sunfury Briefings^Exarch Orelis in Area 52 wants you to take the Warp-Attuned Orb to Manaforge B'naar and use it at the end of its four pipelines.^If our instincts are right and these manaforges have been made using technology from Tempest Keep, then all of Outland could be in grave danger. Tempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land. The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within Kael's pipelines. Take this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies. Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth.A Lingering Suspicion^69^All^Netherstorm^Necromantic Focus^Custodian Dieworth^Malevolent Remnants^^^Collect 10 Loathsome Remnants from the twisted spirits in Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard and bring them to Custodian Dieworth.^The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture. As you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts. How it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations.Neutralizing the Nethermancers^70^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Oazul^Nether-Stalker Oazul^^^^Kill 15 Sunfury Nethermancers and return to Nether-Stalker Oazul at Tuluman's Landing in the Netherstorm.^The blood elves are fools! I'm glad that our trade relations with them have fallen apart. In all of my travels throughout the cosmos, I have never encountered beings so selfish. They continue to destroy the land around us with their manaforges, so let's see if we can put a dent in their operations across the bridge at Manaforge Ara. Their nethermancers channel energy to and from the blood gems to stabilize the flow of power. Go over there and wipe them out!Searching for Evidence^69^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Necromantic Focus^Malevolent Remnants^^^Search Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard for clues about who is behind the manipulation of the spirits.^Whoever is behind the transformation of the spirits has been very deliberate in their actions, taking care to target the most powerful mages first, but why? The kind of magic required to influence the spirits of slain Kirin Tor mages must be very powerful. Why would a powerful mage go to all this trouble? I'm inclined to say this is another plot of Kael'thas's, designed to cause more misery here. If there are blood elves here, they're likely to be hiding in the houses across the covered bridge.Dealing with the Foreman^70^All^Netherstorm^Wind Trader Tuluman^Foreman Sundown^Dealing with the Foreman^^^Deal with Foreman Sundown inside the Trelleum Mine, which is underneath Manaforge Ara in the Netherstorm.^The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine. Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from. Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation. Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves? Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown. The mine is around the back of the island to the left.Dealing with the Overmaster^70^All^Netherstorm^Foreman Sundown^Wind Trader Tuluman^Dealing with the Foreman^^^Slay Overmaster Grindgarr. Then return to Wind Trader Tuluman at Tuluman's Landing in the Netherstorm.^I used to be the foreman here. But now that I've been demoted, I've come to realize our pilgrimage from Quel'Thalas to Outland was all a lie. A lie perpetrated by Kael'thas to strengthen his forces here in the Netherstorm. I've tried to convince my brethren that we should leave, especially with the Burning Legion here, but they are all too stubborn. Do me a favor? Kill Overmaster Grindgarr. Then return to your ethereal and tell him that I am no longer his enemy.Capturing the Phylactery^69^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^Malevolent Remnants^^^Recover Naberius's Phylactery from Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard district and bring it to Custodian Dieworth.^I suppose an explanation is in order. You've met one of the archmage's apprentices, Ravandwyr, but there was also another named Naberius. He was an ardent student, but was drawn to necromancy. When Kael'thas appeared with his forces, Naberius seized the opportunity to betray the archmage, handing over the secrets to the tower's defense. Now, it seems, he has become a lich. If we are to stop him, we must capture his phylactery. Knowing him, he would've buried it somewhere out of sight in his domain.Destroy Naberius!^69^All^Netherstorm^Custodian Dieworth^Custodian Dieworth^Malevolent Remnants^^^Custodian Dieworth in Kirin'Var Village wants you to confront and defeat Naberius in the village's Chapel Yard.^Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor. You must defeat him, <name>, or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var. With his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes?Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu^69^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Anchorite Karja^Naaru Technology^^Sunfury Briefings^Travel to Manaforge Coruu, east of Area 52, and obtain the Coruu Access Crystal from Overseer Seylanna. Use it at the Manaforge Coruu Console to shut it down and return to Anchorite Karja.^Your success at B'naar has given us a great deal of hope, <name>. We've shared our discoveries with the Scryers and in return they've given us more information on the remaining manaforges. Three other manaforges still stand, in full control of the Sunfury army. You will find Manaforge Coruu to the east. Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal there. Obtain it and use it on the manaforge's control console to begin the emergency shutdown. We're all counting on you, <name>.Shutting Down Manaforge Duro^70^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Anchorite Karja^Naaru Technology^^^Anchorite Karja wants you to go Manaforge Duro and obtain the Duro Access Crystal from Overseer Athanel. Use it at the Manaforge Duro Console to shut it down.^We've received news from one of the two manaforges that remain operational. The Sunfury army is losing control of Manaforge Duro. Droves of errant mana creatures have been attracted to it by its increased energy production - the manaforge is in chaos. An explosion at Duro has the potential to cause a chain reaction that would endanger all of Outland. Overseer Athanel is in possesion of the access crystal you need to safely disable the manaforge.Shutting Down Manaforge Ara^70^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Anchorite Karja^Naaru Technology^^^Travel to Manaforge Ara and obtain the Ara Access Crystal from Overseer Azarad. Use it at the Manaforge Ara console to shut it down.^One manaforge is all that keeps Tempest Keep functional. After we bring Manaforge Ara down, Kael will have to resort to depleting whatever energy he's got stored up. Travel to Manaforge Ara, in the northwest, and deliver the final blow that we need by shutting it down. The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad. Be warned that we expect heavy opposition in the last of Kael's functional manaforges. You're likely to need the assistance of reliable friends.The Great Moongraze Hunt^8^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Acteon^Acteon^The Great Moongraze Hunt^^^Bring 6 Moongraze Buck Hides to Acteon at Azure Watch.^Well done, <name>! Well done! Now that you've cut your teeth with the moongraze stag, it's time you graduated to more formidable prey. Do not allow the casual disinterest of the moongraze bucks to fool you: when provoked, they are a fearsome foe. You'll find the bucks north of here. Good hunting.Marks of Kil'jaeden^65^All^Shattrath City^Adyen the Lightwarden^Adyen the Lightwarden^^^More Marks of Kil'jaeden, Single Mark of Kil'jaeden^Bring 10 Marks of Kil'jaeden to Adyen the Lightwarden in Shattrath City.^As you probably know, <name>, the Aldor are keepers of the Light and servants of the naaru. Diametrically opposed to us are the agents of the Burning Legion - demons bent on the destruction of worlds and the corruption of the innocent. If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of low-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. We know of a Shadow Council hideout in the Bone Wastes and there are many Legion outposts in Nagrand and the Blade's Edge Mountains.Sunfury Briefings^70^All^Netherstorm^Exarch Orelis^Exarch Orelis^Sunfury Briefings^Measuring Warp Energies, Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu^^Go to Manaforge Duro and retrieve the Sunfury Military Briefing and the Sunfury Arcane Briefing from the Sunfury units stationed there. Return to Exarch Orellis when you've completed this task.^Something about these manaforges has been bothering me, <name>. Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it. Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication. We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures. It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings. Obtain them and bring them to me.Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar^68^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis. Use it at the B'naar Control Console to shut it down, then report back to Spymaster Thalodien.^I was having a friendly discussion with the Aldor while you were gone. Manaforges sure look like modified naaru technology from Tempest Keep. Apparently, most naaru constructs have certain safeguards that allow them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency. The procedure is usually initiated at a control console via an access crystal. Lo and behold, according to the roster you secured, such a crystal is in the possession of a fellow called Overseer Theredis. Obtain it and see what you can do.Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu^69^All^Netherstorm^Caledis Brightdawn^Caledis Brightdawn^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^Kick Them While They're Down^Obtain the Coruu Access Crystal from Overseer Seylanna. Use it at the Coruu Control Console to shut down the manaforge and return to Caledis Brightdawn.^Thalodien told us of your success in disabling Manaforge B'naar. He expects a repeat performance here and asked us to keep an eye out for anyone using a crystal to access the console inside. Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal, we're sure of it. Go back in there and finish the operation. No need to be stealthy anymore; get the crystal, begin the shutdown, kill the technicians trying to stop you and get out. Hurry, it won't be long before Kael's lapdogs sniff us out.Indispensable Tools^69^All^Netherstorm^Apprentice Andrethan^Apprentice Andrethan^Indispensable Tools^^^Retrieve the Smithing Hammer from the Kirin'Var Apprentices and bring it back to Apprentice Andrethan in Kirin'Var Village.^You haven't seen a heavy smithing hammer lying around by chance, have you? I brought it out here with me to finish the shoes for some of old man Amorlin's horses, but I can't find it. I've searched the barn no less than a half dozen times and I just can't seem to find it. Maybe one of the other apprentices retrieved it and took it back to the smithy? Would you be willing to go down there and take a look? The workshop is to the southeast of the tower in the Town Square.Master Smith Rhonsus^69^All^Netherstorm^Apprentice Andrethan^Apprentice Andrethan^Indispensable Tools^^^Apprentice Andrethan in Kirin'Var Village wants you to kill the ghost of Rhonsus, the town's master blacksmith.^At last, my journeyman project is complete! I can't wait to formally present it to Master Rhonsus. <The apprentice looks at you as you describe your experiences retrieving the hammer.> They attacked you? All of them? By the Light, they've gone mad! What are we to do, <name>? It grieves me to say so, but it may be necessary to kill Master Rhonsus. It would leave me as the only smith in Kirin'Var, but I believe my training is sufficient to serve the town's needs.Help Mama Wheeler^69^All^Netherstorm^Papa Wheeler^Mama Wheeler^Help Mama Wheeler^Pick Your Part^^Speak with Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.^Say, <name>, I was wondering if you could do me another favor. My partner out in the field could probably use a hand. I was wondering if you could go check in on her. I'm sure that Mama Wheeler will appreciate the help. Just don't mind her sharp tongue. She's trying to look out for our interests to the east. You'll find her just inside Eco-Dome Midrealm at the Midrealm Post.Needs More Cowbell^69^All^Netherstorm^Thadell^Bessy^^^When the Cows Come Home^Find Bessy in the fields near Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Hill in Netherstorm.^Where, oh where has my Bessy gone? After the attack, I searched the fields and the Chapel Yard for her, but she was nowhere to be seen! All I have left of her is this old cowbell. She usually comes running when she hears it, but these feeble old bones probably couldn't shake it hard enough. I'll loan you Bessy's bell if you're willing to go out to the fields and ring it as hard as you can. Perhaps all Bessy's waiting for is a little more cowbell.Surveying the Ruins^70^All^Netherstorm^Zephyrion^Zephyrion^^^^Place the three Surveying Markers and then return to Zephyrion at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.^I have to get over to the Ruins of Farahlon to start my excavations! The problem is that the place has been infested by demons! Maybe you could do some preliminary work for me? There are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers. Each is near a draenei banner. Return to me when you've managed to place all three markers.The Minions of Culuthas^70^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^^^^Slay 10 Hounds of Culuthas and 5 Eyes of Culuthas. Then return to Nether-Stalker Nauthis at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.^A few weeks ago, the Burning Legion moved into the Ruins of Farahlon, thwarting our plans to excavate the site for its artifacts. Then earlier today, I learned that one of their dreadlords, Culuthas, somehow killed off all of the other Burning Legion. He has since summoned in demons that serve him. <class>, I want you to go up to those ruins to the northeast and rid them of their demon infestation.When the Cows Come Home^69^All^Netherstorm^Bessy^Thadell^^Needs More Cowbell^^Escort Bessy safely back to her owner, Thadell.^Realizing that Bessy is still staring at you, you gesture toward Thadell's location. You find yourself promising to protect the cow on her way home. Upon finishing your sentence, you realize there's no possible way the cow could understand anything you've said. Shrugging your shoulders, you prepare to guard the bovine on her way back to Thadell.Shutting Down Manaforge Duro^70^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Return to Manaforge Duro and obtain the Duro Access Crystal from Overseer Athanel. Use it at the Duro Control Console to shut it down and report back to Spymaster Thalodien.^So Manaforge Duro is under attack and Sunfury forces have lost control? What a dilemma! If Duro goes down, then Tempest Keep goes down. Only drawback is... if Tempest Keep is destroyed, the explosion will probably take what little remains of this forsaken land with it. Dead Kael'thas is good. Dead everyone else is... not that great, I suppose. It pains me to ask this of you, but go to Manaforge Duro and shut it down before it goes up in flames. The access crystal is held by Overseer Athanel.The Ethereum^70^All^Netherstorm^Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Ethereum^^^Commander Ameer wants you to kill 5 Ethereum Assassins, 5 Ethereum Shocktroopers, 2 Ethereum Researchers and Captain Zovax then activate Ethereum Transponder Zeta.^Directly south of here you will find the Ethereum Staging Grounds. The Ethereum are there, preparing for something... Perhaps an assault on Ultris. We can't take any chances, though, <class>. Break through their perimeter defenses and take out their training facility. Once you've destroyed their soldiers and Captain Zovax, locate Ethereum transponder Zeta and use it to establish contact with me to get your next set of orders.Shatter Point^60^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Forward Commander Kingston^Runetog Wildhammer^Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gatewa^^^Forward Commander Kingston wants you to speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee, ride a gryphon to Shatter Point, and then report to Runetog Wildhammer.^<name>, you've done a great job here at the front, and you showed a lot of talent with that armored gryphon... I think I have another mission in mind for you. This new mission launches from Shatter Point -- an attack base the Wildhammers set up on a floating piece of land near the Portal. It's a little unnerving there, but you have tough guts. You'll be fine. Talk to Wing Commander Dabir'ee and have him send you to Shatter Point. From there, report to the gryphon master Runetog Wildhammer.Kick Them While They're Down^70^All^Netherstorm^Magistrix Larynna^Magistrix Larynna^Kick Them While They're Down^Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu^^Slay 8 Sunfury Conjurers, 6 Sunfury Bowmen and 4 Sunfury Centurions. Return to Magistrix Larynna at Area 52 after completing this task.^The news you've discovered is fortunate, <name>. Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army. Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into. I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up.Securing the Shaleskin Shale^68^All^Netherstorm^Boots^Boots^Securing the Shaleskin Shale^^^Collect 5 Shaleskin Shale and give them to Boots at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^I make a good living selling drinks to the boozehounds around here. But I want something more! The rocket-chief is always telling me how he can't perfect the rocket fuel needed to get the X-52 off of the ground. We can solve that little problem for him. For starters I need to extract the oil from the shale of the local shaleskin flayers! It'll form a concentrated, if explosive, base for the mix that I have in mind. Find the flayers, and their shale, all over the place near the purple rocks.The Unending Invasion^69^All^Netherstorm^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran^The Unending Invasion^Curse of the Violet Tower^^Search the mana creature infested area of Kirin'Var Village for a Mana Bomb Fragment and bring it to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran.^Kael'thas's assault on Kirin'Var began with thundering noise and a bright flash of light in the officer quarters to the northwest. The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the blood elves, a strange thing began to happen. Beings of pure mana began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely.Wing Commander Gryphongar^60^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Runetog Wildhammer^Wing Commander Gryphongar^Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gatewa^^Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^Speak with Wing Commander Gryphongar in Shatter Point.^Wing Commander Gryphongar runs this outfit of Wildhammers. If this is your first time to Shatter Point, then you should report to him. You'll find him inside what's left of that tower over yonder.The Flesh Lies...^70^All^Netherstorm^Agent Araxes^Agent Araxes^^^^Use the Protectorate Igniter on 12 Withered Corpses. Return the Protectorate Igniter to Agent Araxes outside of Access Shaft Zeon when the task is complete.^You see these corpses, <race>? Arconus is responsible for this slaughter. He's sucked them dry, leaving nothing more than a fleshy husk. But don't let the bodies fool you! Inside those corpses lie flesh beasts, waiting to pounce on the unsuspecting fool that gets too close. I've got my orders. I must remain here until backup arrives. That doesn't mean that you can't take my igniter and destroy the withered corpses that litter the mines. One way or another, the mission must be completed.Return to the Abyssal Shelf^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Gryphoneer Windbellow^Gryphoneer Windbellow^^Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^^Gryphoneer Windbellow at Shatter Point in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.^<name>, you've proven yourself as a capable gryphon rider, and we could use you on more sorties over the Abyssal Shelf. What say you, <class>? Do you want some more flight time?Return to the Abyssal Shelf^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Wing Commander Brack^Wing Commander Brack^^Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^^Wing Commander Brack at Reaver's Fall in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.^<name>, are you ready for another sortie over the Abyssal Shelf? I fear that, if we do not maintain pressure on the Legion forces there and allow them to strengthen their hold, then we may suffer a large demon attack from the north. What say you, <class>? Do you want to take another windrider and hammer the Abyssal Shelf one more time?New Opportunities^69^All^Netherstorm^Mehrdad^Mehrdad^^^^Gather 15 Ivory Bells and return to Mehrdad at Midrealm Post.^I hear that a group of 'druids' from Azeroth has taken quite an interest in the effects of our eco-dome technology. The Cenarion Expedition's representatives are eager to get access to the plants growing within the domes, particularly one called the ivory bell, known for its healing properties. They're found in clumps of brush around larger plants in Eco-Dome Midrealm. I'll share the profits with you if you're willing to gather the herbs for my first delivery.The Earthbinder^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Tola'thion^Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze^Crimson Crystal Clue^^Natural Remedies^Take the Crimson Crystal Shard to Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^You should take the crystal lump over to the earthbinder. She's just like you... always needing to get to the bottom of a mystery and thinking all of the time. If you ask me, she thinks a little too much. Just give it to her and I'm sure that she'll get you into a heap of trouble figuring out what is going on up there on the ridge.Behomat^10^Alliance^Warrior^Ruada^Behomat^Strength of One^^^Speak with Behomat at the Traders Tier of the Exodar.^While you have learned many hard lessons from me during our time together, it is time that I entrusted you to wiser hands. Behomat, who trained me when I was as green as grass, will be your new teacher. I have told him that you will be seeking him out, and he is expecting you. You will find him at the center of the Warriors' Terrace, at the highest point of the Traders Tier of the Exodar.Natural Remedies^63^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze^Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze^^The Earthbinder^^Use the Seed of Revitalization at the Earthbinder's Circle to heal the land around the crystal. Then, return to Earthbinder Galandria Nightbreeze at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula with any information that you gain.^It must be that the evil emanations from that giant crystal are summoning the mountain giants and driving them insane. It's too big to move, and beyond our ability to destroy, but I know a way to quell its power. I've summoned a circle at the northwest corner of the crystal on the ridge. Take this seed to the circle and channel its powers to heal the land through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation. Beware, <name>, I sense an external force at play here... this is not natural!Arconus the Insatiable^70^All^Netherstorm^Agent Ya-six^Commander Ameer^^^^Agent Ya-six at Access Shaft Zeon in Netherstorm has asked you to slay Arconus the Insatiable and return to Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.^Araxes and I were deployed to Ultris 2 days ago. Our mission: Find and terminate the void lord Arconus. We tracked him to this mine and discovered that he'd been feeding off the energies of the creatures in the area. A fire-fight broke out which resulted in Araxes and I separating. Now I'm stuck here, badly injured. The mission is in shambles! If you can take out Arconus, high command would be grateful. Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian.Withered Flesh^62^Alliance^Zangarmarsh^Ruam^Ruam^Withered Basidium^^^Gather 5 Parched Hydra Samples and 5 Withered Bog Lord Samples and bring them to Ruam at Telredor.^We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants. It would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too. Return to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area.Shutting Down Manaforge Ara^70^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Travel to Manaforge Ara and obtain the Ara Access Crystal from Overseer Azarad. Use it at the Manaforge Ara console to shut it down.^You've done much better than any of us anticipated. Manaforge Ara is the last of Kael's working manaforges. You'll find it northwest of here, though you're likely to have to do some circumnavigating to get to it. We want you to shut it down. The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad. This is Kael's very last source of energy as far as we know, so expect heavy opposition. I'd bring a couple of friends along if I were you. Hmm... Azarad. What an odd name for a sin'dorei.Jol^12^Alliance^Paladin^Tullas^Jol^Jol^^^Speak with Jol in the Vindicators' Sanctum of the Exodar.^The path of the Light and purity is not an easy one to walk, <name>. Even I, at times, struggle with following its course. You should seek out my master, Jol, at the Exodar. She trained me when I was beginning my journey, and I believe she will find in you a new star pupil. You will find Jol in the Vault of Lights of the Exodar at the Vindicators' Sanctum, a room surrounded by a vibrant glow of light.A Traitor Among Us^62^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Naladu^Naladu^Naladu^^^Naladu at the Ruins of Sha'naar wants you to obtain the Sha'naar Key from a nearby hut.^Anywhere you see a tribe of enslaved Broken you will also find a traitor. A despicable being who sold his brothers for promises of power. There is a hut at the top of the stairs in the center of the ruins. That's the turncoat's hut. He's not there right now, so you will be able to sneak in if you're patient. Inside you will find a coffer with a key inside of it. That key unlocks the chains that keep the Dreghood elders prisoner. Bring it to me. Beware, Arzeth the Merciless wanders nearby.The Dreghood Elders^62^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Naladu^Naladu^Naladu^^^Free Morod the Windstirrer, Akoru the Firecaller and Aylaan the Waterwaker at the Ruins of Sha'naar. Return to Naladu after completing this task.^The Dreghood spirit is broken because our elders are imprisoned. Take this key and go downstairs to free them. They are Morod the Windstirrer, Akoru the Firecaller and Aylaan the Waterwaker. Once they are free, the spirits will return to the Dreghood tribe.Arzeth's Demise^62^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Naladu^Naladu^Naladu^^^Use the Staff of Dreghood Elders on Arzeth the Merciless and slay him after he's lost his powers. Return to Naladu at the Ruins of Sha'naar after completing this task.^Yes, the elemental spirits have returned to us! We are not as strong as we once were, but a little magic can go a long way in the right hands. Arzeth has great powers bestowed upon him by his dark lord. Take this staff. It was once a great symbol of our tribe. Use it against Arzeth and his powers will be temporarily removed from him. Defeat him then, so that my people may finally be free!Yorus Barleybrew^20^All^Warrior^Ahonan^Yorus Barleybrew^Yorus Barleybrew^^The Rethban Gauntlet^Speak with Yorus Barleybrew at the Lakeshire Inn in Redridge Mountains.^A dwarven warrior known as Yorus Barleybrew has issued a challenge to all skilled Alliance warriors. He waits at the Lakeshire Inn, in a place known as the Redridge Mountains in the Eastern Kingdoms. The journey will be long, but it'll be worth it for you to test yourself, <name>.A Discreet Inquiry^16^Horde^Rogue^Zelanis^Eralan^A Discreet Inquiry^^Wrenix of Ratchet^Speak with Eralan in Tranquillien.^Eralan, an associate of mine in Tranquillien, has made an inquiry about securing some help for an urgent job. Now, I don't know what she has in mind because I don't ask questions, but you've proven yourself more than capable. I want you to travel to Tranquillien in the Ghostlands and have a word with Eralan. She may be a bit gruff, but she's trustworthy.A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^50^Alliance^The Exodar^Herald Bran'daan^Commander Ashlam Valorfist^A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^^^Seek out Commander Ashlam Valorfist. His base camp is located at Chillwind Camp, north of the Alterac Mountains.^Hear ye, hear ye! All heroes are called upon to heed these words! A call to arms has been issued by the Kingdom of Stormwind! All able bodied individuals are entreated to take up arms against the dark threat of the Scourge in the northern lands of the Eastern Kingdoms! Rumors fly of new threats rising from the ruins of the Plaguelands! Heroes of the realm - seek out Commander Ashlam Valorfist who has set up his base camp in Chillwind Camp, north of the Alterac Mountains!A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^50^Horde^Western Plaguelands^Herald Amorlin^High Executor Derrington^A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!^^^Seek out High Executor Derrington. His base camp is located at the Bulwark, east of Tirisfal Glade and the Undercity.^Heroes of the realm, hear me - the Horde calls upon you for swift action! A call to arms has been issued for all able bodied individuals to take up arms against the Scourge! Rumors fly of new threats rising from the ruins of the Eastern Kingdoms. They loom to the east of the Undercity, in the northern reaches of the lands now known as the Plaguelands! Heroes of the realm - seek out High Executor Derrington, who has set up his base camp at the Bulwark, east of Tirisfal Glade!A Dark Pact^70^All^Netherstorm^Kaylaan^Kaylaan^Sunfury Briefings^^^Kaylaan at Tuluman's Landing in Netherstorm wants you to slay 6 Gan'arg Warp-Tinkers, 3 Daughters of Destiny and 3 Mo'arg Warp-Masters.^We've been so blind, <name>, that the alliance of two of our most dangerous enemies went completely unnoticed. I wouldn't be surprised if the Scryers had something to do with hiding this information from us, but we must now face the reality. The Burning Legion and Kael'thas' Sunfury army serve under the same banner. These demons are the only reason Kael'thas was ever able to utilize the technology in Tempest Keep. Under Orelis's orders I must command you to destroy them.Aldor No More^70^All^Netherstorm^Kaylaan^Exarch Orelis^Sunfury Briefings^^Against the Legion, Socrethar's Shadow^Report back to Exarch Orelis at Area 52.^My mission here is finished. I did what Orelis ordered me to - I've never failed to. No more. I foresee a great carnage - a crusade, they'll call it - following the news of this alliance between Kael'thas and the Burning Legion. First they give our holiest city away to our enemies and then they ask us to die fighting their enemies. Go back to Orelis; tell him the naaru can fight their own fights from now on.Go to the Front^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Wing Commander Gryphongar^Field Marshal Brock^Go to the Front^Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^^Take a gryphon to Honor Point and speak with Field Marshal Brock.^Well, <name>, I hope you're prepared for the next phase of our operation. The Legion never rests - and neither shall we! Take a gryphon and fly over to Honor Point - it's a small post near the Legion Front. Speak with Field Marshal Brock. He'll have instructions for you when you arrive. Oh, and tell that pasty-faced shield-kisser I said 'hello'.Ethereum Data^70^All^Netherstorm^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Ethereum^^^The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover the Ethereum Data Cell.^Look around you, fleshling. Very close to this transponder should be an Ethereum data cell. Locate that data cell, open it, and retrieve the contents. Bring it back to this transponder at once!Potential for Brain Damage = High^70^All^Netherstorm^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Ethereum^^^The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover 15 pieces of Ethereum Relay Data.^They're using relays to transfer information around the staging grounds. There is only one way for you to see these relays and extract the information they hold. Unfortunately, doing so may cause you irreparable brain damage. If you're still interested, you'll need to slay Ethereum here at the staging grounds and take their essences. Once you have an essence, drink it down. It will temporarily allow you to see an Ethereum relay - giving you enough time to destroy a relay and extract its information.Return to Thrallmar^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Overlord Hun Maimfist^Nazgrel^Return to Thrallmar^Mission: The Abyssal Shelf^The Assassin^Return to Thrallmar and speak with Nazgrel.^Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the Legion's just getting warmed up.The Agony and the Darkness^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Magister Bloodhawk^Magister Bloodhawk^^Doorway to the Abyss, Vile Plans^^Magister Bloodhawk wants you to kill 10 Terrorfiends in the Pools of Aggonar.^Greetings, <name>. I've deciphered the Legion missive and uncovered the demons' strategic plans for this Peninsula. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers.Forge Camp: Mageddon^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Nazgrel^Return to Thrallmar^^^Nazgrel in Thrallmar wants you to attack Forge Camp: Mageddon and kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and return with the head of Razorsaw.^<name>, we have reason to believe that the easternmost forge camp is not yet complete. The Legion's gan'arg servants are working 'round the clock to get the facility up and running. We can't allow that to happen. Head east to Forge Camp: Mageddon and slay 10 gan'arg. Bring me the head of their master - Razorsaw - and the Legion's fel reaver production will grind to a halt! Cannons of Rage^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Nazgrel^Return to Thrallmar^^^Destroy 3 Fel Cannon MKIs in Forge Camp: Rage and return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.^There is a second production facility, Forge Camp: Rage, that lies to the immediate northeast of Thrallmar. The demons have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us! You must enter the camp and destroy these fel cannons. <name>, you must be sure to detonate them all - or nothing will stop the Legion from raining fiery hell down upon our heads!Doorway to the Abyss^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Nazgrel^Return to Thrallmar^^Cruel's Intentions, The Agony and the Darkness^Slay Arix'Amal to get the Burning Legion Gate Key. Use the Burning Legion Gate Key on the Rune of Spite, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.^You are an honor to us, <name>. But now we must strike before the Legion recovers! To the north of Thrallmar lies Invasion Point: Annihilator. It houses a warp-portal through which the Legion draws its reinforcements. You must overload that portal - and blast it back to the abyss it came from. The portal's activation key will be held by the Point's commander - Warbringer Arix'Amal. Slay him. Take the key. Use it on the portal and do what must be done. May the warchief's blessings be with you.Vile Plans^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Burning Legion Missive^Magister Bloodhawk^^^The Agony and the Darkness^Take the Burning Legion Missive to Magister Bloodhawk in Thrallmar.^The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one in Thrallmar that can transcribe such vile script - the blood elf Magister Bloodhawk. Disruption - Forge Camp: Mageddon^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Field Marshal Brock^Field Marshal Brock^Go to the Front^^^Kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and Razorsaw at Forge Camp Mageddon and return to Forward Commander Brock at Honor Point.^Pay close attention, <name>. We've been surveying the Legion camps that lie along the ridge ahead. We have reason to believe that these so-called 'Forge Camps' are where the demons are constructing those blasted Fel Reavers. You can see the closest target, Forge Camp: Mageddon, to the west. Our intelligence suggests that it's still under construction. If you can slay the Gan'arg Servants and their master - Razorsaw - we can bring the Legion's Fel Reaver production to a grinding halt! The Dark Missive^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Burning Legion Missive^Warp-Scryer Kryv^The Dark Missive^^Overlord^Take the Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv in the main keep of Honor Hold.^The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one at Honor Hold who can decipher such archaic script - the draenei mystic, Kryv. Take the Burning Legion Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv who resides within the War-Room at Honor Hold.Enemy of my Enemy...^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Field Marshal Brock^Field Marshal Brock^Go to the Front^^^Destroy 3 Fel Cannon MKIs in Forge Camp: Rage and return to Field Marshal Brock at Honor Point.^Now we focus on the second target - Forge Camp: Rage. It lies just west of Mageddon. Trouble is, the demons have a number of fel cannons aimed straight at the Horde's outpost of Thrallmar! Though I can scarcely believe it, we actually need the Horde to help us hold the line at the Dark Portal. We can't afford to let Thrallmar fall. You've got to destroy these cannons before the Legion pulverizes our allies!Invasion Point: Annihilator^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Field Marshal Brock^Field Marshal Brock^Go to the Front^^^Slay Arix'Amal. Take the Burning Legion Gate Key. Use the Burning Legion Gate Key on the Rune of Spite.^Well, we've located the Legion's final base on the ridge - Invasion Point: Annihilator. It lies northwest of Forge Camp: Rage - and it houses a warp-portal through which the Legion has been drawing its reinforcements! You've got to close that portal to prevent any more demons from coming through. The Point's overlord, Warbringer Arix'Amal, holds the portal's activation key. Take it from him and shut that blasted gateway down!The Heart of Darkness^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Warp-Scryer Kryv^Warp-Scryer Kryv^The Dark Missive^^^Kill 10 Terrorfiends in the Pools of Aggonar and return to Warp-Scryer Kryv in the main keep of Honor Hold.^It is just as I feared. Arix'Amal - the demon you killed earlier, was working for a secret Legionlord - Arazzius the Cruel. It appears this new villain has amassed a force of hellish terrorfiends near the Pools of Aggonar. You must journey there and slay the terrorfiends before they strike against us. But be wary, friend - the Pools of Aggonar lie within a tortured, poisonous valley. You can find the cursed pools to the northwest of here, beyond Hellfire Citadel. Light be with you, <name>.Overlord^63^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Return to Honor Hold^The Dark Missive^^Slay Arazzius the Cruel in the Pools of Aggonar and return to Force Commander Danath Trollbane in the keep of Honor Hold.^The honorable Warp-Scryer has told me of your perils, <name> - and of the new foe you've discovered. If Kryv is to be believed, this 'Arazzius the Cruel' is as powerful and evil as any foe the Sons of Lothar have ever faced. Will you stand for us now, <name>? Will you face this Legionlord and deliver the Light's justice upon him? If so, you will find him at the Pools of Aggonar. If not, his evil will most certainly find you.Naladu^62^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Morod the Windstirrer^Naladu^Naladu^^^Seek out Naladu inside the Ruins of Sha'naar.^Perhaps not all hope is lost for the Dreghood. I am one of four elders that guided this tribe before we were enslaved by the Illidari. I thought the others were dead, but I've slowly learned that at least two others are alive - chained down and powerless just as I am. I've not yet been able to find Naladu and fear for the worst. There are more huts in the ruins upstairs; perhaps you could look for him. It would be a great boon for our tribe if all our elders were alive.S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E^70^All^Netherstorm^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Ethereum^^^The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to recover 1 Prepared Ethereum Wrapping.^We must destroy the machinery that is making these nexus-stalker aberrations possible. To strike at their proto-accelerator would be futile as it is an ethereal creation. We must instead destroy the manaforge energy tube that they are using as a conduit. I have all that I need to create a device to overload the conduit save for one item. I need a wrapping from an archon or overlord that might be transforming soon in order to calibrate the device.Delivering the Message^70^All^Netherstorm^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Ethereum^^^The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to escort the Protectorate Demolitionist to the Manaforge Ultris conduit and keep him protected while he works to sabotage the pipeline.^I'm sending one of my demolitionists out to place the disruption device. Just make sure no harm comes to him as he's placing the disruptor. Keep him protected! He will not fight back if enemies attack him as he is only a holographic image but the image can be destroyed! Return to me once the job is done.Socrethar's Shadow^70^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Anchorite Karja^Socrethar's Shadow^Aldor No More^^Anchorite Karja at Area 52 wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.^The infamous eredar, Socrethar, leads the Burning Legion in Netherstorm. Mentioning his name is enough to make most draenei shudder. He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access. To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task. The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion. The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.Nexus-King Salhadaar^70^All^Netherstorm^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Ethereum^^^The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to use the Protectorate Disruptor to bring down Salhadaar's force fields and then destroy Nexus-King Salhadaar.^I have in my possession another disruptor, one capable of destroying the three conduits that surround Salhadaar. Once the conduits are destroyed, Salhadaar's protective force fields will be down. For this act, he will strike at you with a ferocity you have never before witnessed, <name>. If you are willing to rid the world of Salhadaar, I will give you the disruptor.Deathblow to the Legion^70^All^Netherstorm^Ishanah^Ishanah^Socrethar's Shadow^^^High Priestess Ishanah wants you to go to the Legion Teleporter at the northwestern corner of Netherstorm and use it to teleport to Socrethar's Seat. Once there, defeat Socrethar.^When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part. Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them. Take this stone to the Invasion Point: Overlord, between Forge Base: Oblivion and Gehenna and bring your closest, strongest friends with you. Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them. May the Light prevail today, <name>. May Socrethar meet his end.Ishanah's Help^70^All^Netherstorm^Anchorite Karja^Ishanah^Socrethar's Shadow^^^Take Socrethar's Teleportation Stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light on the Aldor Rise in Shattrath City.^The time has come to face Socrethar, <name>. Confronting an eredar leader isn't something that's taken lightly among us. A single mistake is likely to cost us our lives if we're ill-prepared. Take Socrethar's teleportation stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light in Shattrath City. She will determine how we need to handle the situation.Electro-Shock Goodness!^70^All^Netherstorm^Researcher Navuud^Researcher Navuud^^^^Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm has asked that you destroy 30 Void Waste Globules and 30 Seeping Sludge Globules.^Around the ruined manaforge you will find the run-off of Dimensius's handy work. Seeping sludge occupies the pools that surround Ultris. Directly below those pools, where the Ethereum Staging Grounds now stand, you will find even more run-off in the form of void waste. The best method of disposal is to use electro-shock to break slimes down to globules. Use this elixir to augment your attacks with electricity. The resultant discharge will break the slimes up into their raw form. Destroy the globules!Firewing Signets^65^All^Shattrath City^Magistrix Fyalenn^Magistrix Fyalenn^^^Single Firewing Signet, More Firewing Signets^Magistrix Fyalenn in Shattrath City wants you to bring her 10 Firewing Signets.^It is no secret that Kael'thas Sunstrider perceives us as a great threat. Let's face it - not many sin'dorei, fresh from Silvermoon, are willing to join the sort of company that Kael keeps. It's also no secret that this is not just a war of words. Scryers and the armies that serve Kael'thas attack each other on sight. The only way to prove you're with us, <name>, is to do your share of fighting. Kael's lower ranking followers wear Firewing signets to indicate their rank. Bring them to me.The Horrors of Pollution^70^All^Netherstorm^Vial of Void Horror Ooze^Researcher Navuud^^^^Take the Vial of Void Horror Ooze to Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.^You carefully fill a vial with the fallen void horror's ooze. Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post would be quite interested in such a find! Take it to him at once!Synthesis of Power^70^All^Shattrath City^Voren'thal the Seer^Voren'thal the Seer^^^Arcane Tomes^Voren'thal the Seer in Shattrath City wants you to obtain an Arcane Tome.^Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters. There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune. Should you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune. Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need. In Outland this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up.Run a Diagnostic!^68^All^Netherstorm^Mehrdad^Mehrdad^Run a Diagnostic!^^^Retrieve the Diagnostic Results and return them to Mehrdad at Midrealm Post.^Wherever the Consortium establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments. Netherstorm's volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me?Deal With the Saboteurs^68^All^Netherstorm^Mehrdad^Mehrdad^Run a Diagnostic!^^^Mehrdad at Midrealm Post wants you to kill 8 Barbscale Crocolisks.^In searching the area for clues about the damage to our equipment, I've seen pieces of the shield generators at the bottom of the small lake to the north. I'm not sure why the crocolisks have taken an interest in the equipment, but we have to put a stop to this problem. The Consortium is quite clear on this matter. If it comes down to a choice between the equipment and crocolisks, the animals will have to go. I'll make it worth your while to deal with them.A Cleansing Light^70^All^Shattrath City^Ishanah^Ishanah^^^Fel Armaments^Bring a Fel Armament to Ishanah in Shattrath City.^This temple is one of the holiest places in all of Outland. The power of the Light here is so strong, that even items with the strongest fel taint can be cleansed of a worldly item. Should you run into any fel armaments in your confrontations with demonic enemies, bring them to me and I will demonstrate the cleansing power of the Light.Captain Tyralius^70^All^Netherstorm^Flesh Handler Viridius^Flesh Handler Viridius^^^^Flesh Handler Viridius at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm has asked that you find and free Captain Tyralius.^Captain Tyralius took a platoon of soldiers south towards the Ethereum Staging Grounds 10 days ago. We haven't heard from him or his crew since. Chances are good that they were ambushed and killed but I'm getting a curious reading from my instruments. I think it's a distress signal but these things have been wrong before. If Tyralius is still alive, they're keeping him in one of their prisons. You'll have to locate the prison and open it with a key, probably found on the warden.To the Stormspire^69^All^Netherstorm^Mehrdad^Ghabar^Run a Diagnostic!^^^Speak with Ghabar at the Stormspire in Netherstorm.^Master Engineer Ghabar will want to know about the results of the diagnostics. If anything, they caution us to keep a close eye on the workings of our dome generators. As the fields become more and more unstable, their effects will become harder to control. It could spell disaster for our expedition and anything else housed within the domes. You'll find Ghabar at the Stormspire. Just follow the road north from this eco-dome and across the bridge. It'll lead you to the elevator at the base of the spire.Diagnosis: Critical^69^All^Netherstorm^Ghabar^Ghabar^Run a Diagnostic!^^^Use the Diagnostic Device while standing near the Eco-Dome Sutheron Generator and bring the Diagnostic Results back to Ghabar at the Stormspire.^If Mehrdad's results are correct -- and I have no reason to believe they're faulty -- then the rest of the domes could be in trouble. I do think Mehrdad has failed to identify the underlying cause of the failures. From time to time, creatures damage the generators, but never this severely. To be on the safe side, I'd like for you to run a set of diagnostics at the Stormspire's main dome generator, located in Eco-Dome Sutheron at the very eastern edge of the dome.Escape from the Staging Grounds^70^All^Netherstorm^Captured Protectorate Vanguard^Commander Ameer^^^^Escort the Captured Protectorate Vanguard back to Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.^Thank K'aresh! He would have torn me apart! I'm a Protectorate soldier, fleshling. My platoon was sent on a recon mission about 10 days ago. As we were moving across the upper ledges of this island, a group of Ethereum jumped us. At least I think it was Ethereum. They had the same energy color but their wrappings looked void. Only Tyralius was spared. I think they put him in a prison cell. I've got to get back to the Protectorate Watch Post! Can you escort me back?Flora of the Eco-Domes^69^All^Netherstorm^Aurine Moonblaze^Aurine Moonblaze^Flora of the Eco-Domes^^^Use the Energy Field Modulator on Farahlon Lashers. Observe the results and report back to Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire when you have conducted 10 tests.^Just look around you, <class>! Isn't it amazing? Of course, this incredible resurgence of life is a byproduct of the ethereal domes, but imagine what it could do in the hands of the expedition. I'm preparing to negotiate with the ethereals for access to their technology, but I'd like to get a better idea of its effects on plant-based life. I've built a device to concentrate the dome's energies on the lashers in this area. Would you be so kind as to test it for me and share the results?Creatures of the Eco-Domes^69^All^Netherstorm^Aurine Moonblaze^Aurine Moonblaze^Flora of the Eco-Domes^^^Tag 12 Talbuks for Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire. You may tag either Talbuk Sires or Talbuk Does using the Talbuk Tagger.^Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well. Gathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid. Using this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy.The Missing Fisherman^10^Alliance^Azuremyst Isle^Dulvi^Cowlen^The Missing Fisherman^^^Find Cowlen at the southeast docks of Silvermyst Isle off the coast of Azuremyst.^In the fevered dreams of our injured guest, she spoke of a fisherman, Cowlen, who was in some distress at Silvermyst Isle, to the southwest, off the coast of Azuremyst. With all that has been happening, no one has had the opportunity to look into it, but I do feel a bit of worry. Perhaps there's something you can do, <name>?When Nature Goes Too Far^69^All^Netherstorm^Aurine Moonblaze^Aurine Moonblaze^Flora of the Eco-Domes^^^Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire wants you to bring her a Hulking Hydra Heart.^The dome technology possesses such power! Certainly, there are bounds beyond which we dare not go, <name>. Creatures allowed to grow too large or too fast could be just as bad as a barren landscape. I have heard rumors of just such a creature in the pool to the east. I've heard the ethereal merchants conspiring to catch the overgrown hydra for sport, but I have another purpose in mind for the giant. Bring me the creature's heart so I may study it.Testing the Prototype^69^All^Netherstorm^Ghabar^Tashar^Run a Diagnostic!^^^Bring the Repair Apparatus to Tashar at Eco-Dome Farfield in Netherstorm.^I've been working on a portable generator repair kit for use in some of the harsher climates that the Consortium operates in. Granted, it wasn't designed for Netherstorm, but we shouldn't have any problems with it. I had already scheduled a test with one of my best techs up at Eco-Dome Farfield beyond the Netherstone to the northeast. Take this prototype to Tashar. He'll know what to do with it. If it works, we can use it to reinforce the shield generators at the larger domes.Outside Assistance^70^All^Netherstorm^Exarch Orelis^Kaylaan^Sunfury Briefings^^^Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of Area 52, and speak to Kaylaan.^The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges. Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara. I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area. Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to Kaylaan. See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara. Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them.Damning Evidence^70^All^Netherstorm^Magister Theledorn^Spymaster Thalodien^Kick Them While They're Down^^^Obtain 8 Orders from Kael'thas from demons at Manaforge Ara and bring them to Spymaster Thalodien in Area 52.^As you may have noticed, there are servants of the Burning Legion all over Manaforge Ara. Kael'thas has entered an alliance with the Burning Legion. He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly. If the Scryers get definite proof of this, it will give them a considerable political advantage. I know for a fact that the Legion forces at this manaforge have orders that bear Kael's seal. Get these orders and bring them to Thalodien.Keeping Up Appearances^69^All^Netherstorm^Shauly Pore^Shauly Pore^Keeping Up Appearances^^^Bring 10 Ripfang Lynx Pelts to Shauly Pore at Midrealm Post.^The ethereals are clever and very observant, so it's no accident that I'm here posing as a simple furrier. In fact, I've been sent from Area 52 to appraise the technology the ethereals use to generate their eco-domes. I'd like to enlist your help, <class>. We've been asked to use non-goblin agents whenever possible. What I want you to do is bring me a number of ripfang lynx pelts in the guise of a hunter. You can find the lynxes all over Eco-Dome Midrealm.The Dynamic Duo^69^All^Netherstorm^Shauly Pore^Audi the Needle^Keeping Up Appearances^^^Speak with Audi the Needle at the Stormspire in Netherstorm.^Excellent job. <Shauly winks at you.> I think they're buying it. Now, when I send you up to speak with my associates at the Stormspire, there won't be any suspicion at all. You'll want to look for Action Jaxon and Audi the Needle up there. They'll tell you everything you need to know. Tell 'em Shauly sent you.Retrieving the Goods^69^All^Netherstorm^Audi the Needle^Audi the Needle^Keeping Up Appearances^^^Audi the Needle at the Stormspire wants you to bring her 10 Dome Generator Segments.^<Audi looks around and then lowers her voice.> I'm sure Shauly told you a bit about our work here. When Jaxon and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the ethereal eco-dome generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the raptors in Eco-Dome Farfield. It's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the Netherstone. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces?All Clear!^69^All^Netherstorm^Tashar^Tashar^Run a Diagnostic!^^Success!^Tashar, stationed at Eco-Dome Farfield, wants you to kill 12 Scythetooth Raptors.^Before we can begin the test, we have to make certain the area is clear of anything that might interfere. In our case, that means these overgrown lizards. <Tashar gestures toward the scythetooth raptors.> There's no telling what might happen if one those decides to take a nice bite out of the generator while it's charging. I've seen a lot of strange things in all my years as a technician, including more than a few abominations that had their beginnings as humble animals.Recipe for Destruction^70^All^Netherstorm^Professor Dabiri^Professor Dabiri^Recipe for Destruction^^^Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to recover 8 Fragments of Dimensius.^Atop Manaforge Ultris lies the tear in the nether that the void lord, Dimensius, came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the void, rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this plane of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius. To do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work.On Nethery Wings^70^All^Netherstorm^Professor Dabiri^Professor Dabiri^Recipe for Destruction^^^Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to use your Phase Disruptor when you get in range of the Void Conduit that rests atop Ultris. Drop as many charges of the Phase Disruptor as you can to ensure total annihilation. The Phase Disruptor charges will automatically home in on the Void Conduit so long as you are close enough to use it.^Here it is, <name>. Take this phase disruptor and mount up! The Protecotrate nether drake will fly you close enough to Ultris so that you can drop the disruptor on top of the void conduit. Drop as many disruptor charges as possible to ensure complete annihilation! When you are ready, speak with the nether drake and he'll take you up. If you miss the mark you will have to get more bombs from me before you can go up again.Dimensius the All-Devouring^70^All^Netherstorm^Professor Dabiri^Professor Dabiri^Recipe for Destruction^^^Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to speak with Captain Saeed and then follow his army to Manaforge Ultris and kill Dimensius the All-Devouring!^Your brave actions have forced Ameer to react! He has deployed Captain Saeed and the Avengers! Now all that is left to do is destroy Dimensius. When you are ready, I will call for Saeed. If he is not currently fighting another battle, he will be awaiting orders from you - directly east of here. Let him know when you are ready to fight and he will put his troops in motion! I wish you luck, fleshling! We have hunted Dimensius for a thousand years!Success!^69^All^Netherstorm^Tashar^Ghabar^^All Clear!^^Return to Ghabar at the Stormspire in Netherstorm.^The test was a resounding success! We can certainly use this device to start repairing the domes. Carry word of the test results to the Stormspire and let Ghabar know that I've also found a pattern in the damage to the shield generators. Key pieces of generator units have gone missing from a number of sites. This is no accident, <name>, no technological failure. We're being stolen from.Helping the Cenarion Post^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Falconer Drenna Riverwind^Thiah Redmane^Helping the Cenarion Post^^^Falconer Drenna Riverwind wants you to offer your services to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^<class>, there's some tauren by the name of Thiah Redmane that keeps pestering us for assistance. She's with the Cenarion Expedition, and they've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the the road leading to Zangarmarsh. If you hit Thornfang Hill, you've gone too far. Do you think you might head over there and see what she needs? I don't want to have to bother Ranger Captain Venn'ren with such trivialities.Helping the Cenarion Post^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Amaan the Wise^Thiah Redmane^Helping the Cenarion Post^^^Amaan the Wise would like for you to offer your services to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.^The Cenarion Circle has sent an expedition to Outland and, as I understand it, they are here to study what has happened and to help reverse any damage that they can. They've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the road leading to Zangarmarsh. If you hit Thornfang Hill, you've gone too far. Would you please go and see how you might help them? Speak with Thiah Redmane as she is the one that sent the request to us for assistance.Report to the Allerian Post^64^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Jenai Starwhisper^Lieutenant Meridian^What Are These Things?^^^Jenai Starwhisper wants you to report to Lieutenant Meridian at the Allerian Post in Terokkar Forest.^This calls for immediate action! We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with. He'll have a better idea of what our next step should be. Report to Lieutenant Meridian out at the Allerian Post and apprise him of the situation. You'll find the post to the northeast on the southern bank of the river just south of Firewing Point. Godspeed, <name>.The Final Code^65^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Lieutenant Meridian^Jenai Starwhisper^What Are These Things?^^Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know^Lieutenant Meridian wants you to use The Final Code to set off the Mana Bomb. Then report back to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.^They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard. My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by Sharth Voldoun, the overseer of the project at Firewing Point. <name>, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him. He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire. Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off. Only then will we be certain that the Allerian Stronghold is safe.The Final Code^65^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Sergeant Chawni^Tooki^What Are These Things?^^Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know^Sergeant Chawni wants you to use the Final Code Sheet to set off the Mana Bomb. Then report back to Tooki at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.^They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard. My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by Sharth Voldoun, the overseer of the project at Firewing Point. <name>, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him. He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire. Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off. Only then will we be certain that Stonebreaker Hold is safe.Report to Stonebreaker Camp^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Tooki^Sergeant Chawni^What Are These Things?^^^Tooki wants you to report to Sergeant Chawni at Stonebreaker Camp in Terokkar Forest.^This calls for immediate action! We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with. She'll have a better idea of what our next step should be. Report to Sergeant Chawni out at Stonebreaker Camp and apprise her of the situation. Take the road north out of the hold. From the middle of Tuurem, follow the road to the east. You'll find the camp on the bank of the river that lies just southwest of Firewing Point. Good luck, <name>.Apothecary Zelana^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Vurtok Axebreaker^Apothecary Zelana^Bonechewer Blood^^Spinebreaker Post^Vertok Axebreaker in Thrallmar wants you to bring Bonechewer Blood Samples to Apothecary Zelana at Reaver's Fall.^Apethecary Zelana has been studying the beasts of Hellfire Peninsula in the field. She wants a sample of the blood you gathered; with luck, she might discover what turned those Bonechewer freaks' skins red! Zelana is at Reaver's Fall, southeast of Thrallmar. Follow the road east and when you see a destroyed, green-glowing hunk of metal, you're there. She has a camp set up behind the wyverns.Bonechewer Blood^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Vurtok Axebreaker^Vurtok Axebreaker^Bonechewer Blood^^^Bring 12 Bonechewer Blood Vials to Vurtok Axebreaker in Thrallmar.^Bonechewers! They should all die! The sight of their red skin and depravity makes my blood boil! I have a mission for you, <name>. Kill Bonechewer orcs and collect their vile blood. There is an apothecary who needs the blood for her tests, so we can discover how these orcs fell to the demon taint, a taint from which we so recently freed ourselves. Bonechewers scavenge near the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory, to the south. Return to me when your mission is complete.Escape from Coilskar Cistern^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Wilda^Earthmender Torlok^^^^Escort Earthmender Wilda out of Coilskar Cistern and then seek out Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation, found at the western outskirts of the Hand of Gul'dan.^Thank the Earthmother! I parted ways with the others several days ago. I was intent on discovering the source of the disturbance that the spirits of water were feeling. My search led me to Coilskar where I discovered that the naga were befouling the water supply of Shadowmoon Valley. Unfortunately, I was discovered and taken prisoner. There's no telling what ghastly things they had in store for me. We must leave this place! Help me escape and then seek out Torlok at the Altar of Damnation.The Encroaching Wilderness^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rina Moonspring^Rina Moonspring^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Slay 12 Grovestalker Lynxes.^We've been growing the Living Grove at an accelerated rate, but somehow the lynxes there have become lost to our control. Where once their population was stable, the grovestalker lynxes are now beginning to encroach upon Sylvanaar, and there have been a number of unpleasant incidents of late. I suspect that the arakkoa of Veil Lashh are somehow behind it, but the immediate issue is with the lynxes themselves. I would be most grateful if you would help us to deal with this situation.Marauding Wolves^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rina Moonspring^Rina Moonspring^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Collect 4 Thunderlord Dire Wolf Tails.^The filthy races of the Horde have taken over a settlement to the east. They've brought with them a large pack of the dire wolves that they prefer to use as mounts and sentries. These sentries have been marauding across the bridge that separates us. They've been stalking our fey drakes, which are critical to the pollination of the Living Grove. Use the east exit to traverse the bridge over Bloodmaul Ravine that leads to the Jagged Ridge to the east, and bring me their tails as proof!Protecting Our Own^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rina Moonspring^Rina Moonspring^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Use Rina's Bough on 5 of the Grove Seedlings to summon forth defenses for the Living Grove.^Though you've done a great deal of good work in defense of our new home here, I still feel that the Living Grove needs more protection. Please, take this small tree bough that I have imbued with the force of nature. When used upon the seedlings that I have planted out in the grove, it will call down a storm to accelerate the growth of a treant defender. These treants are critical to the defense of the grove, especially if you choose not to make Sylvanaar your home for long.Enraged Spirits of Fire and Earth^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Torlok^Earthmender Torlok^The Hand of Gul'dan^^^Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 8 Earthen Souls and 8 Fiery Souls.^We must try and make amends. We must commune with the elements of this region and see if anything can be done! I grant you the totem of spirits, <race>. If you slay an enraged elemental spirit in close proximity of the totem, it will consume the elemental's soul. You must use the totem to consume many souls before you may return to me. Do this for the spirits of fire and earth first. Return to me when the totem is full.Sage's Vow^70^All^Caverns of Time^Soridormi^Soridormi^Sage's Vow^Sage's Pledge^^Bring your Band of Eternity to Soridormi at the Caverns of Time after obtaining Honored reputation with the Scale of the Sands.^You've made your pledge, <class>.

Of these, none match the ogres in sheer brute power. If you seek to prove your prowess to us, bring me the warbeads they wear around their necks. I will tell others of your accomplishments.Enraged Spirits of Water^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Torlok^Earthmender Torlok^The Hand of Gul'dan^^^Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 5 Watery Souls.^The Illidari naga of the region have taken control of the only clean water supply that exists in Shadowmoon Valley. Directly north of here you will find the lair of the naga: Coilskar. Around Coilskar are pockets of agitated water that howl to the land in anguish. It is at those pockets that the enraged spirits of water now wander. Travel to Coilskar and use the totem of spirits to capture watery souls. You will find the largest concentration of these spirits near Coilskar Cistern.Enraged Spirits of Air^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Torlok^Earthmender Torlok^The Hand of Gul'dan^^Oronok Torn-heart^Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use the Totem of Spirits to capture 10 Airy Souls.^Venture southeast, hero. When you see fields of gigantic blue crystals jutting out from the land, you will have reached your destination. It is there, at the Netherwing Fields, that you will find the enraged spirits of air. They roam the cliffs and mountain bases that surround the fields. Destroy their tortured forms and capture their souls with the totem of spirits. Return to me when this is done.Fel Orc Scavengers^58^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Lieutenant Amadi^Lieutenant Amadi^Know your Enemy^^^Kill 20 Bonechewer Orcs and return to Amadi in Honor Hold.^Scavengers, orcs of the Bonechewer clan, skulk about the ruined battlements overlooking the Path of Glory. We must assume that these fel orcs are gathering war machine parts for their masters within Hellfire Citadel -- they must be stopped! Find Bonechewer orcs to the north, <name>. Find them and slay them! But use caution, for although these orcs are the lesser of the fel orc clans, their strength is the match of any green-skinned orc we've faced thus far...Ill Omens^58^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Lieutenant Amadi^Corporal Ironridge^Know your Enemy^^Cursed Talismans^Lieutenant Amadi in Honor Hold wants you to bring 1 Cursed Talisman to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point.^<name>, in our battles with the Bleeding Hollow clan of fel orcs, we have found upon them foreboding trinkets. These orcs have collected the insignias of fallen Honor Hold soldiers and created cursed talismans from them. We fear the dark magic of the Bleeding Hollow orcs have transformed our insignias into evil charms with powers against us! Find such a talisman from the Bleeding Hollow orcs of Zeth'Gor, to the east, and bring it to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point, northeast of Zeth'Gor.Cursed Talismans^58^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Corporal Ironridge^Corporal Ironridge^Cursed Talismans^Ill Omens^^Bring 12 Cursed Talismans to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point.^<name>, we cannot allow the Bleeding Hollow orcs to possess their cursed talismans! You must acquire them for us so they may be disposed of, and so the soldiers who owned them may be honored for their sacrifices. Go to Zeth'Gor, the cursed abode of the Bleeding Hollow, and perform your grim task... return to me when you have collected the talismans.Warlord of the Bleeding Hollow^60^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Corporal Ironridge^Corporal Ironridge^Cursed Talismans^^^Bring Warlord Morkh's Shattered Armor to Corporal Ironridge in Expedition Point.^You have shown great strength and fortune, for you have delved into Zeth'Gor and lived! Now, let us hope your fortune holds, for I have a dire task to ask of you... Warlord Morkh sits within the barracks of Zeth'Gor, commanding his fel troops against us. His tactics are as clever as they are cruel, and I must admit that his successes against us have cut deep. And so, <name>, I ask you to remove Morkh from his seat. Bring me his armor so that we might display it for our soldiers and bolster them.The Encroaching Wilderness^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Gor'drek^Gor'drek^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Slay 12 Bladewing Bloodletters.^The Thunderlord were once a proud orc clan before they were transformed into fel orcs through the blood of Mannoroth. Recently we recovered this orc stronghold from the ogres that infest the ravine below. They had moved in when the Thunderlord clan abandoned it. We will keep this place and I will have your help doing so. In the Jagged Ridge to the south and the west, there are bloodletters that have become like a plague upon us. They eat and breed incessantly. Kill them and then return to me.Dust from the Drakes^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Gor'drek^Gor'drek^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Collect 4 Dusts of the Fey Drake.^The Alliance has recently moved in to the west, using their elven magics to grow a town and grove in a short matter of time. We must keep their defenses weak so that they do not also grow a spine. I have a plan that will do that and more. I want you to traverse the bridge to the southwest, which crosses over Bloodmaul Ravine and leads into the Living Grove. Attack their fey drake defenses in the Living Grove and bring back the magical dust that sometimes can be found upon their wings.Protecting Our Own^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Gor'drek^Gor'drek^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Use Gor'drek's Ointment on 5 of the Thunderlord Dire Wolves.^With the magical dust you recovered, I have fashioned a magic ointment that will aid in our own defenses. Our dire wolves are the perfect combination of mount, sentry and friend, but the Alliance scum have been poaching them in the Jagged Ridge. <name>, I want you to take this ointment and apply it to our dire wolf friends. The Alliance will get a rude surprise the next time that they send one of their hunting parties. Be aware though that some of the wolves may not like this, and will turn on you.Felling an Ancient Tree^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Wanted Poster^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^^^^Collect Stronglimb Deeproot's Trunk.^WANTED! Stronglimb Deeproot, ancient of war and chief defender of the Living Grove south of Sylvanaar. Find him by heading west across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine. Return his hewn trunk to Tor'chunk Twoclaws.Call of Water^20^Draenei^Shaman^Farseer Umbrua^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Water^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^I'm sensing that it's been a while since last you were tested. This is because Farseer Nobundo has been asking for you. You must have grown greatly in wisdom because you are being called to learn the mysteries of the element of water. I trust that you remember how to take the boat from Auberdine in Darkshore on Kalimdor back to the Exodar? And that you remember where to find the farseer at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar, yes?Call of Air^30^Draenei^Shaman^Farseer Umbrua^Farseer Nobundo^Call of Air^^^Speak with Farseer Nobundo at the Crystal Hall inside the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.^<name>, once again Farseer Nobundo has been asking for you. It must be time for you to learn the secrets of air, the last of the elements! I want you to know that I'm very proud of all that you have accomplished thus far. I know that you have great things ahead of you. Take the boat from Auberdine in Darkshore on Kalimdor. Cross the Veiled Sea and seek out the farseer inside the Crystal Hall of the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.An Earnest Proposition^60^Alliance^Shaman^Deliana^Deliana^^^A Supernatural Device^Acquire 15 Winterspring Blood Samples and 20 gold and bring them along with a set of Bindings of Elements to Deliana in Ironforge.^Well met, <class>. I've something that might interest you. I have in my possession a set of armor much like the one worn by those of your profession, but of much higher quality.

Bring me a sizeable sample of it along with the bracers and a small amount of gold.

I can tell by your demeanor that you've seen and done much in this world. Yet I'm willing to wager you haven't seen a piece of armor like this. Perform a small favor for me and I'll be willing to trade it to you for an ordinary set of bracers. I'm in need of a sizeable sample of venom drawn from the spiders and scorpions that inhabit Silithus. Bring this to me along with a few gold coins and I'll perform the exchange.Just Compensation^60^Alliance^Shaman^Deliana^Deliana^Just Compensation^Return to Deliana^In Search of Anthion^Bring a Cord of Elements and a set of Gauntlets of Elements to Deliana in Ironforge.^You kept your word and brought the device built by Mux.

If we both see this through I shall make the rest of the pieces available to you.Anthion's Parting Words^60^Alliance^Shaman^Anthion Harmon^Deliana^Anthion's Parting Words^The Challenge^Bodley's Unfortunate Fate^Return to Deliana in Ironforge with a set of Boots of Elements, a Kilt of Elements and Pauldrons of Elements.^Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet. In our greed we foolishly split it into three parts, not knowing the curse that would await us. The only way to stop Valthalak's spell is to put the medallion back together. Return to Deliana and tell her that Bodley is her only hope for finding the remaining pieces. Speak to her about any rewards you've arranged for. I, for once, shall rest in peace. I wish you the best of luck; you shall need every bit of it!Anthion's Parting Words^60^Horde^Paladin^Anthion Harmon^Mokvar^Anthion's Parting Words^The Challenge^Bodley's Unfortunate Fate^Return to Mokvar in Orgimmar with a set of Lightforge Boots, Lightforge Legplates and Lightforge Spaulders.^Valthalak's soul was stored in this amulet.

As to your reward, I believe I have a few things that you have definitely earned and will truly enjoy.The Horde Needs Your Help!^60^Horde^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Senior Sergeant Eveningshade^Warlord Gorchuk^^^^Speak with Warlord Gorchuk in Orgrimmar's Valley of Spirits.^Hello, I'm glad that you've decided to hear me out. The Horde needs all of the help that it can get to prepare for the Ahn'Qiraj War, and that means that we need you! Even now as we speak, official collectors are gathering the necessary material needed for the upcoming war, but we won't be able to meet our goals without your assistance, <name>! You should go speak with the guy in charge, Warlord Gorchuk. What do you say, <class>? Will you help out with the vital preparations?The Alliance Needs Your Help!^60^Alliance^Ahn'Qiraj War Effort^Master Sergeant Thelaana^ ^^^^Speak with Field Marshal Snowfall in Ironforge's Military Ward.^Hello, I'm glad that you've decided to hear me out. The Alliance needs all of the help that it can get to prepare for the Ahn'Qiraj War, and that means that we need you! Even now as we speak, official collectors are gathering the necessary material needed for the upcoming war, but we won't be able to meet our goals without your assistance, <name>! You should go speak with the guy in charge, Field Marshal Snowfall. What do you say, <class>? Will you help out with the vital preparations?The Bloodmaul Ogres^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Skyshadow^Commander Skyshadow^The Bloodmaul Ogres^^^Slay any 30 Bloodmaul Ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost.^There is a threat to Sylvanaar far deadlier than the Horde at Thunderlord Stronghold. I'm speaking of the native ogres of these mountains. Just to the south and east, down in the ravine, lives the Bloodmaul clan. While they aren't the only group of ogres that threaten us here, they are the closest. I would have you head south through the Living Grove, and then go down the path to the east, which leads to their outpost. Slay as many of the Bloodmaul ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost as you can.The Bladespire Threat^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^The Bladespire Threat^^^Slay any 30 Bladespire Ogres and 10 Bladespire Raptors at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.^There is a threat to Thunderlord Stronghold worse than the Alliance at Sylvanaar. I speak of the ogres of these mountains. Just to the west, down in the ravine, lies the Bladespire clan. While they aren't the only ogres, they are the closest and they're the ones that we defeated to take this place. Head north through the Jagged Ridge, and then down the path, which leads to their hold. Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres and their raptors as you can at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.The Bladespire Ogres^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Skyshadow^Commander Skyshadow^The Bloodmaul Ogres^^^Slayl any 30 Bladespire Ogres in Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.^To the north of the Bloodmaul clan lies a threat more grave: Bladespire Hold. The Bladespire ogres are the strongest clan in the mountains, having the favor of the gronn known as Gruul the Dragonkiller, and his seven sons. Now that we've dealt with winnowing the Bloodmaul, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals. From Bloodmaul Hold head north through the ravine until you come to Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds. Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres therein as you can.The Bloodmaul Ogres^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^The Bladespire Threat^^^Slay any 30 Bloodmaul Ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost.^To the south of the Bladespire clan lies yet another threat: Bloodmaul Outpost. While the Bloodmaul ogres are not the strongest clan in the mountains, not having the favor of the gronn known as Gruul the Dragonkiller, they run a close second. Now that we've dealt with winnowing the Bladespire, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals. From Bladespire Hold head south through the ravine until you come to Bloodmaul Outpost. Slay as many of the Bloodmaul ogres in the vicinity as you can.A Dire Situation^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rina Moonspring^Rina Moonspring^The Encroaching Wilderness^^^Apply Rina's Diminution Powder to 5 of the Bloodmaul Dire Wolves at Bloodmaul Outpost and in Bloodmaul Ravine.^With their wolf pack reduced, the Horde is looking for replacements. Unfortunately there's another source nearby. The Bloodmaul ogres in the ravine below to the east keep a strong pack as their own sentries. I hated sending you to kill the Thunderlord wolves, so why don't we do something different this time? I've derived a magic powder from the dust that naturally falls off the wings of our fey drakes. Sprinkle it on the Bloodmaul dire wolves to make them undesirable to the Horde.Turning Point^70^All^Netherstorm^Voren'thal the Seer^Voren'thal the Seer^Kick Them While They're Down^^^Use Socrethar's Teleportation's Stone at Invasion Point: Overlord, north of Forge Base: Oblivion to transport your party to Socrethar's Landing. Once there, use Voren'thal's Presence to defeat Socrethar.^This is the chance we've been waiting for, <name>. Not only have we uncovered the evidence we need to show our people who Kael'thas is really working for, but we can prove our strength by defeating his new masters. My frail health prevents me from aiding you in person with this endeavor, but I will offer you an object that will allow me to project my powers across the continent.A Gift for Voren'thal^70^All^Netherstorm^Spymaster Thalodien^Spymaster Thalodien^Kick Them While They're Down^^^Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to obtain the First Half of Socrethar's Stone from Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion and the Second Half of Socrethar's Stone from Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.^I don't want to send you to Voren'thal empty-handed. It's not in my style to be underwhelming. To gain access to Socrethar's Seat in the north, we'll need to use his own teleporters - locked by Socrethar's teleportation stone. The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base Oblivion. The second half is held by the demon Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna. Obtain these and Voren'thal will be impressed beyond words.Bound for Glory^70^All^Shattrath City^Spymaster Thalodien^Voren'thal the Seer^Kick Them While They're Down^^^Bring Socrethar's Teleportation Stone to Voren'thal the Seer at the Scryer's Tier in Shattrath City.^Now I can properly send you back to Shattrath City. You've uncovered evidence of Kael'thas making pacts with the Burning Legion and you've got the key to the overlord's back door. Make sure Voren'thal doesn't topple over with excitement from the news - the old man's getting a bit fragile, if you know what I mean. You'll find him inside the Seer's Library at the Scryer's Tier.Into the Draenethyst Mine^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Bronwyn Stouthammer^Bronwyn Stouthammer^^^^Collect 5 Draenethyst Mine Crystals.^Well it's good to see someone who's willing to help out around here! Borgrim and I are part of the Explorers' League, and we're here to learn what we can of these mountains. We've heard all sorts of tales, and I can't wait to get settled in and started. One thing in particular has caught my attention. The night elves speak of a place down in the ravine to the east known as the Draenethyst Mine. It's at the south end of Bloodmaul Outpost. I'd like some of the crystals that grow naturally therein.Strange Brew^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Borgrim Stouthammer^Borgrim Stouthammer^^^Getting the Bladespire Tanked^Collect 11 Bloodmaul Brutebane Brew.^If I'm going to start this vacation out right, then I'm going to need more brew. Unfortunately, the elves know nothing of the fine art of fermentation. I overheard that the Bloodmaul ogres down in the ravine have plenty. I'm willing to give it a try. Do me a favor? Head south through the Living Grove and then down the ramp to the east into Bloodmaul Outpost and procure me some? I hear they have big barrels of it laying around and that their brewmasters carry it around to all the other ogres.Getting the Bladespire Tanked^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Borgrim Stouthammer^Borgrim Stouthammer^^Strange Brew^^Use the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg in an attempt to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk.^I'll not take another sip of that ill-smelling muck! But it does give me an idea. <Borgrim gets a twinkle in his eye.> So here's the plan. We know that the Bloodmaul practically live off of this swill. But I wonder what their enemies, the Bladespire ogres, think of it? <name>, I want you to take the rest of this rubbish and see if you can get the Bladespire ogres tanked. You can find them by heading north from Bloodmaul Outpost through the ravine.Oronok Torn-heart^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Torlok^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^Enraged Spirits of Air^^Seek out Oronok Torn-heart on the Shattered Shelf - north of Coilskar Cistern.^I do not know how we can acquire the spell that the spirits mentioned, <name>. Truth be told, I don't even know where we would start such a search. <Torlok stares off in the distance, lost in thought.> Hrm... It is a long shot but it might be our only chance. There is an orc that I have seen visit this area before. I spoke to him briefly once. He is a hermit that claims to live above Coilskar Cistern to the northeast. Seek out this orc, Oronok Torn-heart. As I said, it is a long shot.I Was A Lot Of Things...^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^^^Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 10 Shadowmoon Tubers from the Shattered Plains.^I've been a lot of things, stranger, but what I once was isn't what's important. What I am now is what matters and what I am now is a farmer. I use trained felboars to dig up tubers from the hardened earth of the Shattered Plains. Recently, though, flayers from a nest to the northeast have been attacking my animals, preventing me from gathering tubers. Would you go to the area north of here and gather tubers for me? Use this whistle while standing on a tuber mound and a boar will come dig one up!A Lesson Learned^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^^^Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to destroy 10 Ravenous Flayer Eggs on the Shattered Plains.^We need to show those flayers what happens when you mess with Oronok's business! I want you to go back to the Shattered Plains and destroy every flayer egg that you see. They'll be deep in flayer territory so keep your guard up.The Trappings of a Vindicator^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Vindicator Vuuleen^Vindicator Vuuleen^The Trappings of a Vindicator^^^Collect Vindicator Vuuleen's Blade and Vindicator Vuuleen's Shield.^I know it's strange, but I do want to stay in this cage. It gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here for; to gather information on the Bladespire. I can leave at any time, but I would like to have my sword and shield back. Two of their leaders have my trappings. Droggam has my sword and Mugdorg has my shield. If you have need, obtain and use the brew from Bloodmaul Outpost to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink!Gorr'Dim, Your Time Has Come...^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Vindicator Vuuleen^Vindicator Vuuleen^The Trappings of a Vindicator^^^Slay Gorr'Dim, leader of the Bladespire Hold ogres.^The leader of Bladespire Hold is known as Gorr'Dim. Trust me... the name is appropriate. Still, I wouldn't underestimate him. He's crafty enough to have elevated his clan to be the favorite of Gruul the Dragonkiller and they now dominate these mountains. And Gorr'Dim keeps an entourage about him at all times, including defenders who are sworn not to drink the Bloodmaul brew. For the safety of Sylvanaar, I'm asking that you go back in there and deal with him.Planting the Banner^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Vindicator Vuuleen^Commander Skyshadow^The Trappings of a Vindicator^^Where Did Those Darn Gnomes Go?^Use the Bladespire Banner atop the Northmaul Tower to lure Gurn Grubnosh. Collect the Bladespire Clan Banner and the Helm of Gurn Grubnosh.^I want you to steal the Bladespire banner from one of their champions and take it south to Bloodmaul Outpost. Plant it atop their Northmaul Tower. This will infuriate the Bloodmaul and they will attack you relentlessly. But it will also keep their hatred focused on Bladespire Hold, and away from Sylvanaar. You will know you have accomplished the deed when you have defeated Gurn Grubnosh and taken his helm. Return it to Sylvanaar. <name>, this isn't going to be easy. Take a friend or two with you.The Cipher of Damnation - Truth and History^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^Oronok Torn-heart^^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok, Ar'tor, Son of Oronok, Borak, Son of Oronok^Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to listen to his story. Speak to Oronok to begin hearing his story.^<Oronok adjusts his posture and stands to his full height.> I had to be sure, <name>. And to be sure, I had to test you. Please excuse the little masquerade. I am as much a farmer as you are <female/male>. Which is to say, not at all. If you are to recover the Cipher of Damnation, you will need to listen to what I have to tell you. When you are ready, let me know and I will tell you the story.Assisting Arch Druid Staghelm^50^Alliance^The Exodar^Caregiver Breel^Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm^Assisting Arch Druid Staghelm^^^Speak with Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.^Excuse me <class>, but I'd like just a moment of your time if possible. The Cenarion Circle in Darnassus is looking for seasoned adventurers such as yourself to lend them aid in a vital research project. While I do not know the specifics, I can inform you that none other than Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm is spearheading this research. Please - if you are interested, speak with him directly in the Cenarion Enclave within Darnassus proper.Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^The Cipher of Damnation - Truth and Hist^^Find Grom'tor, Son of Oronok at Coilskar Point in Shadowmoon Valley.^My first born, Grom'tor, left to search Coilskar Point - directly southwest of here. He's the warrior in the family - ill-tempered and blood-thirsty... Traits he inherited from his mother. Search along the outskirts of Coilskar Point. If you see naga corpses, Grom'tor is sure to be close. When you find him, tell him this: "We spill blood for just cause." It will let him know that you are a friend to Torn-heart and prevent your premature death.The Cipher of Damnation - Grom'tor's Charge^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^^^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok at Coilskar Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the First Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation.^This naga filth is the sixth one I've interrogated today. He's got the fancy armor so I figured he knew something. Those other ones were useless. <Grom'tor points to the corpses of the naga around him.> I only had to beat him once and he told me everything. The first part of the cipher is hidden in a naga chest at Coilskar Point or Coilskar Cistern, east of here. He says naga carry the keys. Kill 'em, take their keys and use them to open the Coilskar chests. Return to me when you find the cipher.The Cipher of Damnation - The First Fragment Recovered^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^Oronok Torn-heart^Grom'tor, Son of Oronok^^The Cipher of Damnation^Take Grom'tor's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley.^<Grom'tor wraps the documents up and places them in a lockbox.> Take this box to father. He awaits your return at the farm, northeast of here. Tell him that I will be home soon. As soon as I am done having my fun...Thunderlord Clan Artifacts^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Thunderlord Clan Artifact^Rokgah Bloodgrip^Thunderlord Clan Artifacts^^^Collect the Thunderlord Clan Drum, Thunderlord Clan Arrow and the Thunderlord Clan Tablet.^The artifact bears markings that indicate its origins as being created by the Thunderlord clan orcs. These orcs used to live at Thunderlord Stronghold before they were changed into fel orcs. For a time the Bladespire ogres inhabited the stronghold until recently when the Horde pushed them out. You've heard of other artifacts that were lost. A drum, an arrow and a tablet come to mind as objects that you know are being sought after. Find them in Bladespire Hold and return them to Rokgar Bloodgrip.Vision Guide^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rokgah Bloodgrip^Rokgah Bloodgrip^Thunderlord Clan Artifacts^^^Use the Fiery Soul Fragment to transform your spirit into a vision guide, which will reveal the location of the final Thunderlord artifact.^<race> fool. You almost destroyed the drum! I've worked too hard to get here, and my hands have been empty up until now. At least you were able to succeed where the others only met with failure, or worse. It is time to evoke a vision that will lead you to the last relic that I have been seeking. Take this fiery fragment of my soul. Use it to transform your body into flame and denature your spirit into a vision guide that will shoot forth to reveal the location of the final Thunderlord relic.The Thunderspike^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rokgah Bloodgrip^Rokgah Bloodgrip^Thunderlord Clan Artifacts^^The Spirits Have Voices^Collect the Thunderspike.^If the vision that I granted you is true, then you must travel down into the ravine and to the south end of Bloodmaul Ravine. There you will find the Draenethyst Mine. Journey to the back of the mine, and retrieve the Thunderspike. Ignore everything else! I have no interest in the crystals of the mine, nor the ogres therein. As soon as you have the spear return it to me here! And, <name>, be very careful with it... I would hate to think what would happen to you should you break it.Ar'tor, Son of Oronok^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Ar'tor, Son of Oronok^Ar'tor, Son of Oronok^The Cipher of Damnation - Truth and Hist^^Find Ar'tor, Son of Oronok at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.^My youngest son, Ar'tor, left to search Illidari Point - far to the southwest, nestled between Legion Hold and Wildhammer Stronghold. While Ar'tor is a hunter of remarkable skill and an expert tracker, I fear that he may be in over his head this time. Illidari Point is the proving grounds for Illidan's demons. These are demons that left the Burning Legion to join the Betrayer! Travel to Illidari Point and find Ar'tor, <name>.Demonic Crystal Prisons^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Ar'tor, Son of Oronok^Ar'tor, Son of Oronok^Ar'tor, Son of Oronok^^Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart^Seek out and slay Painmistress Gabrissa at Illidari Point and return to the corpse of Ar'tor, Son of Oronok with the Crystalline Key.^From assessing the scene, you note that Ar'tor is being held in place by energy beams emanating from the crystals hovering around the rune. Try as you might, Ar'tor is unmovable. You note that the crystals have an empty slot at their base - perhaps for a key. It also seems as if succubi periodically perform some sort of ritual at the site. Search Illidari Point for their leader. Perhaps she holds the key to releasing Ar'tor.Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Spirit of Ar'tor^Spirit of Ar'tor^Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart^Demonic Crystal Prisons^^The Spirit of Ar'tor at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart from the demons of the area.^It is a sign, <name>. Even in death, I cannot be stopped. Recovering a part of the Cipher of Damnation is my destiny. With your help, that destiny will be fulfilled. Before we embark on that journey, I must have my longbow, Lohn'goron. It is a family heirloom that has been handed down from Torn-heart to Torn-heart for generations. My instinct tells me that a demon stole it from my corpse. Kill the demons here until you find my bow.Boiling Blood^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Albreck^Apothecary Albreck^Boiling Blood^Spinebreaker Post^^Use Bleeding Hollow Blood at the Cursed Cauldron to make Boiled Blood. Bring 12 Boiled Blood to Apothecary Albreck at Spinebreaker Post.^That last experiment was not a complete loss -- I did save a small bit of the blood you brought me. Now boiled down, it should be free of whatever curses the Bleeding Hollow witches placed on their people's blood. I need more for study. Go gather Bleeding Hollow blood from the orcs in Zeth'Gor. When you've gathered the blood, bring it to their cursed cauldron and boil it. Bring me the boiled blood.The Cipher of Damnation - Ar'tor's Charge^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Spirit of Ar'tor^Spirit of Ar'tor^Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart^^^The Spirit of Ar'tor at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Second Fragment of the Cipher of Damnation from Veneratus the Many.^At last, we are ready. I will bestow a piece of my spirit upon you, hero. It will guard you and help you in your battle against evil. You must then travel south of here towards the back of Illidari Point. Hidden in the ether is a vile creature known as Veneratus the Many. My spirit hunter will call him out when he is near. Destroy Veneratus and take from his corpse the second part of the Cipher of Damnation.The Cipher of Damnation - The Second Fragment Recovered^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Spirit of Ar'tor^Oronok Torn-heart^Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart^^The Cipher of Damnation^Take Ar'tor's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley.^I thank you, hero. For without you, my spirit would forever remain in this cursed place. <Ar'tor hands you a spectral lockbox.> Take it and deliver it to my father at the farm, far to the northeast, above Coilskar Cistern... Inside are Lohn'goron and the second part of the cipher. He will be sad to hear news of my death. Promise me that you will assure him that I died a free soul. Tell him that I see the hunting grounds and they are glorious. Tell him that I wait for him there...They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews!^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^T'chali the Witch Doctor^T'chali the Witch Doctor^They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews!^^^Collect T'chali's Hookah and 10 Bloodmaul Brutebane Brews.^T'chali used to be a pretty friendly troll. Me come down here to teach the Bloodmaul how to brew their beer. But once me do that, the Bloodmaul bury T'chali and leave him here to rot! The worst part of it was that they stole me hookah! So, you want to help T'chali? You bring me hookah back. T'chali think the ogres that stole it headed southwest over by the mine. And while you're in there, pick up some brews, too!Grimnok and Korgaah, I Am For You!^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^T'chali the Witch Doctor^T'chali the Witch Doctor^They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews!^^^Slay Grimnok Battleborn and Korgaah.^T'chali has been waiting for his revenge! The day they bury T'chali and leave him to die, it was Grimnok Battleborn that led them. And the next day it was Korgaah that come south to raid and kick T'chali in the head. I want them dead! You will find Grimnok atop the Southmaul Tower in Bloodmaul Outpost. You will find Korgaah in the top of a building at the north end of Bladespire Hold. Korgaah has sober defenders, so use the brew to distract him away from them, because they won't drink.A Curse Upon Both of Your Clans!^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^T'chali the Witch Doctor^T'chali the Witch Doctor^They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews!^^^Use the Wicked Strong Fetish to curse 5 buildings or towers in Bladespire Hold and 2 in Bloodmaul Outpost.^T'chali wants revenge on all of the ogres! T'chali was a powerful witch doctor in life. If you reach into me grave you will find a wicked strong fetish. Invoke the fetish's magic at the entrances to the buildings and towers of both Bladespire Hold and Bloodmaul Outpost. The voodoo you work will summon an evil spirit that you must defeat. This in turn will curse that building. Beware, if you attempt to curse a building that is already cursed, you will call down another cursed spirit!Bladespire Kegger^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^T'chali the Witch Doctor^T'chali the Witch Doctor^They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews!^^^Use the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk.^As T'chali was saying, he helped out his Bloodmaul friends to make their brew. But what T'chali did not say was why. The Bloodmaul are in dire straits. The Bladespire clan be crushing them, and they needed a new weapon to help out with their fight. That's when T'chali came up with a great idea. Why not make the perfect brew, one that strengthens you and weakens your enemy? Only thing is, T'chali does not know if it works. So, you gonna take this brew up to Bladespire Hold and see if it works!Borak, Son of Oronok^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Borak, Son of Oronok^Borak, Son of Oronok^The Cipher of Damnation - Truth and Hist^^Find Borak, Son of Oronok near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley.^While Ar'tor was off hunting and Grom'tor was off fighting, Borak studied. Eventually he took up a vocation as a scholar and left for the wilds of Draenor. He returned home a few years ago a changed orc. His heightened sense of awareness and mental acuity had forged a silent assassin. Now a confident and powerful orc, he has taken to recovering the most guarded piece of the cipher. Find Borak hiding near Eclipse Point, far to the south. He watches from the shadows of the bridge.Of Thistleheads and Eggs...^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Borak, Son of Oronok^Tobias the Filth Gorger^Borak, Son of Oronok^^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge north of Eclipse Point wants you to find a Rotten Arakkoa Egg and deliver it to Tobias the Filth Gorger in Shattrath City, located in northwest Terokkar Forest.^I'd have given up had I not noticed... He's a Thistlehead. I couldn't place it at first but the signs are all there... Now if we could get our hands on some bloodthistle, we'd be in business. In my travels, I met a shady Broken in Shattrath named Tobias. Tobias made a business of trading bloodthistle to blood elves for rotten arakkoa eggs. Directly west of here are arakkoa ruins. Search them for an egg and head to the lower city of Shattrath. That's where you'll find Tobias.The Sad Truth^18^Horde^Rogue^Eralan^Eralan^A Discreet Inquiry^^^Eralan in Tranquillien wants you to retrieve the Archeologist's Shrunken Head from one of the chests in Zeb'Tela or Zeb'Nowa.^Remember how I told you about the fat merchant who was looking for that ring? As it turns out, he had his archeologist son looking for the thing and it didn't turn out so well. By not so well I mean they killed him and shrunk his head. Now this might seem cold, calculating, and exceptionally callous, but he'd pay a lot to get his son's head back. Sounds like the perfect job for you! Go east until you find the troll ruins of Zeb'Tela and Zeb'Nowa. You're bound to find it one of the chests there.The Bundle of Bloodthistle^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Tobias the Filth Gorger^Borak, Son of Oronok^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^Of Thistleheads and Eggs...^^Take the Bundle of Bloodthistle back to Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley.^I wasn't lying. That egg was incredible. Where did you get it from? Well, if you ever need more bloodthistle, you know where I am and what I need. Here's a bundle of the stuff. Take it back to your benefactor.Voren'thal the Seer^65^All^Shattrath City^Khadgar^Voren'thal the Seer^^Allegiance to the Scryers^^Speak to Voren'thal the Seer inside the Seer's Library at the Scryer's Tier in Shattrath City.^Now that you've chosen a side, <name>, you should meet the Scryers' leader. You will find Voren'thal the Seer inside the Seer's Library at the Scryer's Tier. See if you can be of assistance to him. He will be glad to hear you've decided to lend them a hand.Ishanah^65^All^Shattrath City^Khadgar^Ishanah^^^^Speak to Ishanah inside the Shrine of Unending Light at the Aldor Rise in Shattrath City.^Now that you've decided to side with the Aldor, you'd do well to introduce yourself to their leader. You will find High Priestess Ishanah inside the Shrine of Unending Light.Malaise^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Daranelle^Lashh'an Tome^Malaise^^^Collect 18 Plucked Lashh'an Feathers.^The magic practiced by the Lashh'an arakkoa is unnatural. They rip out handfuls-clawfuls?-of their own feathers as reagents! That doesn't sound like good magic to me. I've come here to learn more about their spells. Unfortunately getting close is too much for me. You could succeed: cast one of their spells on yourself, then return to me. You'll have to find one of their spellbooks, high up in the trees of Veil Lashh. And unless you've grown feathers I can't see, you'll need to get some of those.Scratches^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Lashh'an Tome^Daranelle^Malaise^^^Use the Fistful of Feathers on the Lashh'an Spell Circle.^The pictograms indicate using feathers to cast the spell at one of the circles of power in Veil Lashh. Confusing iconography seems to show an arakkoa being suffused with the spirit of a kaliri.Test Flight: The Zephyrium Capacitorium^64^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tally Zapnabber^Tally Zapnabber^Test Flight: The Zephyrium Capacitorium^^Test Flight: The Singing Ridge^Speak with Rally Zapnabber and use the Zephyrium Capacitorium.^I built an amazing device, the Zephyrium Capacitorium, and I'm sure it'll work perfectly, but... do you want to help me test it? There's plenty of hazard pay! Speak with my twin over there, Rally. Good luck, <name>. Come back after your experiment. Or... if that's not possible due to sustained injuries, your next of kin can report to collect your pay.Revered Among the Sha'tar^70^All^The Eye^A'dal^A'dal^^^^A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to become revered with the Sha'tar by defeating the forces of Kael'thas inside Tempest Keep.^<The calming melodic tones projected by A'dal become more hushed and somber.> <You are shown the large naaru structure known as Tempest Keep. It is now inhabited by the forces of Kael'thas and its power used for nefarious ends. A'dal promises you greater tasks once you've done your part to take back Tempest Keep.>Besieged!^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Wing Commander Nuainn^Visions of Destruction^^^Wing Commander Nuainn, outside of Wildhammer Stronghold, wants you to kill 10 Infernal Attackers.^Don't let your guard down, <race>. We're under constant assault from the Burning Legion. From their base of Legion Hold to the northwest, the demons rain down a ceaseless stream of infernals. As quickly as we can kill them, the new meteors impact and begin a new wave of attacks. My men are ragged and exhausted. I don't know how much longer they'll hold out. Please, <name>, lend your help to our defenses. Take your place on the line and halt the advance of the infernals!To Legion Hold^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Wing Commander Nuainn^Visions of Destruction^^^Make your way to Legion Hold and locate the Legion Communication Device. While standing near the communication device, use your disguise and learn about the Legion's plans. Return to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold when you've completed your mission.^The fortress of Legion Hold is nigh impregnable, and to be completely honest, I can't spare the forces for an assault. Our hopes are riding on you, <name>. What little information we've been able to gather indicates that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and learn about their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. Good luck, <name>.Blast the Infernals!^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Wing Commander Nuainn^Visions of Destruction^^^Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold, then report to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold.^The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power. If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.The Stones of Vekh'nir^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Dertrok^Dertrok^^^Trial and Error, Understanding the Mok'Nathal^Collect and use a Vekh'nir Crystal at the Vekh'nir Spell Circle to create a Charged Vekh'nir Crystal.^The arakkoa of Vekh'nir have been a thorn in our sides for many years. Some strange religion guides them, a religion which has the arakkoa in a frenzy of activity. They carry these crystals with them now, which they have turned to some dark purpose. I know something of their rituals. They take the crystals to their spell circles to infuse them. We at the village would like to know more. Waylay a few of the arakkoa until you find a crystal, charge it, then return it to me.Trial and Error^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Dertrok^Dertrok^Trial and Error^The Stones of Vekh'nir^^Try out each of Dertrok's wands on an Arakkoa Ogre Slave. Each wand will require an Infused Vekh'nir Crystal to use.^I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to Trogma's Claim, and try them on the ogre slaves. You'll need to find an infused crystal off of the arakkoa in the area. When you figure out which is best, come back to me.Creating the Pendant^66^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Timeon^Timeon^Creating the Pendant^^^Collect 6 Ruuan'ok Claws and use them at the Ruaan'ok Oracle Circle to summon a Harbinger of the Raven. Kill it to collect its Harbinger's Pendant.^The arakkoa of Ruaan Weald elevate from their flock the Harbingers of the Raven, the heralds of their god. They believe that the Harbingers watch over them from the sky, where they receive the teachings of the Raven, and descend to pass this message along. The Harbingers hold a powerful sway over the souls of the arakkoa. They use magical pendants, which we need. Attract one of the Harbingers by slaying its flock and taking their claws. Place the claws upon the altar to get his attention.Tablets of Baa'ri^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Anchorite Ceyla^Anchorite Ceyla^Tablets of Baa'ri^^Oronu the Elder^Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar wants you to collect 12 Baa'ri Tablets from the ground and from Ashtongue Workers at the Ruins of Baa'ri.^Years ago, the dreaded warlock known as Gul'dan raised the volcano in the middle of Shadowmoon. The draenei village of Baa'ri, to the southwest, was buried under the lava along with its inhabitants and artifacts of religious importance. The treacherous tribe of Broken known as the Ashtongue has been ordered by Illidan to excavate the area. We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor, now known as the Black Temple.The Sketh'lon Wreckage^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Gryphonrider Kieran^Gryphonrider Kieran^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Recover the Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 1, Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 2, and Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 3 from the Dark Conclave arakkoa at the Sketh'lon Wreckage to Gryphonrider Kieran.^Our scouts have brought back disturbing reports from the ruined arakkoa encampments in the area. The ghosts of powerful arakkoa magicians wield powers we never thought they possessed. They seem to be organizing, as though preparing for something, but our knowledge is limited. We cannot afford to remain ignorant! Travel north to the Sketh'lon Wreckage, to the northwest of the Deathforge and search for signs of their motives.To Catch A Thistlehead^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Borak, Son of Oronok^Borak, Son of Oronok^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^^^Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Stormrage Missive.^<Borak takes the bundle of bloodthistle from you and places it to his nose.> Pungent... Now, take this bundle and place it at the other end of this bridge. When the envoy makes his daily rounds, he will be compelled to pick it up - without his bodyguard. You see, blood elves look down upon bloodthistle addicts. If any of his compatriots ever found out... All you need to do is lie in wait for him to dismiss his bodyguard. When he is alone, make your strike! Kill him and take the missive.Oronu the Elder^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Anchorite Ceyla^Anchorite Ceyla^Tablets of Baa'ri^^^Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar wants you to obtain the Orders from Akama from Oronu the Elder at the Ruins of Baa'ri.^According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri. Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor. We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet. Its power would provide great aid in our fight against Illidan. Akama's lieutenant at Baa'ri, Oronu the Elder, receives written orders from him daily. Obtain them and bring them to me.Setting Up the Bomb^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Wing Commander Nuainn^Visions of Destruction^^^Obtain a Fel Reaver Power Core and a Fel Reaver Armor Plate and bring them to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold.^We cannot permit the Legion to carry out its plan to destroy Wildhammer Stronghold on their march to the Black Temple. There's only one way to stop them, <name>. You must create an explosive large enough to destroy the Legion's entire stockpile of infernals at the hold. The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the base of your device. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for armor plating we might be able to make a casing from.The Deathforge^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^Visions of Destruction^^^Report to Stormer Ewan Wildwing at the Deathforge Tower.^From your findings at Legion Hold, we know that the Legion's Shadow Council allies are producing infernals in the Deathforge. I've dispatched a small scouting party to keep watch over the area, but they're not able to accomplish everything we need. If the Deathforge is left alone to operate, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold. I want you to meet up with Stormer Ewan Wildwing, at the Deathforge Tower, to the northwest, overlooking the Deathforge itself.The Ashtongue Corruptors^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Anchorite Ceyla^Anchorite Ceyla^Tablets of Baa'ri^^^Obtain the four medallion fragments from Haalum, Eykenen, Lakaan and Uylaru and return to Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley.^According to Akama's letter, four fragments of the medallion were unearthed and given to the Ashtongue Corruptors. These dreaded Broken were once powerful shaman who now defile the very elements they revered. Haalum, Corruptor of Air, can be found at Netherwing Pass. Eykenen and Uylaru, Corruptors of Earth and Fire, were last seen at the Fel Pits near the Hand of Gul'dan. Lakaan, Corruptor of Water, is rumored to be near Coilskar Point. Find them and obtain the medallion fragments.The Warden's Cage^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Anchorite Ceyla^Sanoru^Tablets of Baa'ri^^Proof of Allegiance^Anchorite Ceyla wants you to enter the Warden's Cage, south of the Ruins of Baa'ri and interrogate Sanoru on Akama's whereabouts.^The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion. The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half. I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning. He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage. I want you to find that dreaded prison, and find the whereabouts of Akama. His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to.The Shadowmoon Shuffle^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Borak, Son of Oronok^Borak, Son of Oronok^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^^^Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 6 pieces of Eclipsion Armor.^<Borak looks you up and down.> This is going to be tricky, but I think I can make it work. I can disguise you as one of these Illidari blood elves, <name>. What I need first, though, are several pieces of their armor. It is imperative that the armor be clean. No blood stains! We want to avoid suspicion. Bring me the gear and I'll take care of the rest of the disguise. Once the disguise is assembled, you're going to deliver the message to the Grand Commander - in person.What Illidan Wants, Illidan Gets...^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Borak, Son of Oronok^Borak, Son of Oronok^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^^^Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to Deliver Illidan's Message to Grand Commander Ruusk at Eclipse Point.^Take this disguise and enter Eclipse Point. Once inside, use the disguise to cloak yourself. The Eclipsion blood elves will be unable to see through the disguise, thereby granting you safe passage to Grand Commander Ruusk. Once you find Ruusk, tell him where next to move the cipher. You're going to have to act your heart out, <name>. Play it off as if you are his superior, delivering a message from his lord. That should do it! Oh - watch out for the dragonhawks as they see through the disguise.The Cipher of Damnation - Borak's Charge^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Borak, Son of Oronok^Borak, Son of Oronok^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^^^Borak, Son of Oronok at the bridge near Eclipse Point in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover the Third Part of the Cipher of Damnation from Ruul the Darkener.^That Cipher fragment will never reach Zuluhed. You're going to ambush Ruul the Darkener and his transport before it has a chance to make the delivery. The Dragonmaw Fortress is directly east of here, across the Netherwing Fields. Somewhere between Dragonmaw Fortress and the Sanctum of the Stars is where you'll find Ruul. Strike hard and strike fast! And <name>, from the sound of it, this Ruul is going to be tough. Keep your guard up. Return the Cipher to me should you succeed.The Cipher of Damnation - The Third Fragment Recovered^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Borak, Son of Oronok^Oronok Torn-heart^The Bundle of Bloodthistle^^The Cipher of Damnation^Take Borak's Lockbox to Oronok Torn-heart at Oronok's Farm in Shadowmoon Valley.^Take this box to my father. He still resides at Oronok's Farm, far to the north, above Coilskar Cistern. When all three fragments are pieced together, the ancient words will be known once more. Good luck, <name>. Tell my father that I will be home soon.Where Did Those Darn Gnomes Go?^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Skyshadow^R-3D0^Where Did Those Darn Gnomes Go?^Planting the Banner^^Search the southern area of the Jagged Ridge of the Blade's Edge Mountains for a clue as to the whereabouts of Toshley and the other gnomes.^Despite the good that we've done here, I feel bad about one thing: driving Toshley and his gnome friends away. We had no choice; they were making a mess of our efforts in the grove with all of their technology and experimentation. I would appreciate it if you would find out what became of them. Last we heard, they headed east across the bridge. I'm certain that they must have turned south, away from Thunderlord Stronghold. Look for a clue as to their whereabouts in the southern Jagged Ridge.Follow the Breadcrumbs^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^R-3D0^Toshley^Where Did Those Darn Gnomes Go?^^Picking Up Some Power Converters^Follow the trail of spare parts up the ramp to the Razor Ridge. Speak with Toshley at Toshley's Station in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^VERY WELL, I AM HEREBY WARNING YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND NOTHING UP ON THE RIDGE. DO NOT FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF SPARE PARTS THAT LEAD TO TOSHLEY'S STATION! YOU WILL NOT FIND TOSHLEY, NOR ANY OTHER GNOME THERE.Minions of the Shadow Council^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^Visions of Destruction^^The Fate of Flanis, The Summoning Chamber^Stormer Ewan Wildwing at the Deathforge Tower wants you to kill 10 Deathforge Guardians and 5 Deathforge Summoners.^<Ewan listens to you recount the events at Legion Hold, nodding.> That puts our observations into perspective. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that. The Shadow Council has the Deathforge sealed tighter than a new keg o' thunderbrew. The first thing you'll need to do is crack some skulls so you can get in there and poke around. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!The Fate of Flanis^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^^Minions of the Shadow Council^Bring Down the Warbringer!^Stormer Ewan Wildwing at Deathforge Tower wants you to search the Deathforge for Flanis Swiftwing and recover Flanis's Pack.^Wing Commander Nuainn originally sent three of us out here to keep watch over the Deathforge and to gather information. Flanis Swiftwing volunteered to try to infiltrate the Deathforge, but we haven't heard anything from him in days. I fear the worst, <name>. Flanis is a skilled scout, but if he's gotten in over his head, we have no way of knowing. Search the Deathforge for him and recover any information or items he might have collected.Picking Up Some Power Converters^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Toshley^Toshley^Picking Up Some Power Converters^Follow the Breadcrumbs^Ridgespine Menace, Cutting Your Teeth, Test Flight: The Singing Ridge^Use the Protovoltaic Magneto Collector to collect 5 Electromentals.^Those dumb ogres at the Bladespire Outpost to the north have been raiding our power converters! And you're going to get them back for me, sort of. No doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters. So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it. It'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere.The Summoning Chamber^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^^Minions of the Shadow Council^Bring Down the Warbringer!^Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. Report to Stormer Ewan Wildwing at the Deathforge Tower when you've completed your task.^In order for the Shadow Council to construct infernals as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures. The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.Bring Down the Warbringer!^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Stormer Ewan Wildwing^Wing Commander Nuainn^Bring Down the Warbringer!^The Fate of Flanis, The Summoning Chamber^^Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold.^We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council's operations at the Deathforge, but if we're to truly be triumphant, we'll need to defeat the Legion's overseer there. I found a key among the items in Flanis's pack. I'm certain it will prove useful in tracking down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold. After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Wing Commander Nuainn. He'll want to know immediately!Karabor Training Grounds^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Exarch Onaala^Exarch Onaala^Karabor Training Grounds^^^Exarch Onaala at the Altar of Sha'tar wants you to obtain 8 Sunfury Glaives from Demon Hunter Supplicants and Demon Hunter Initiates at the Ruins of Karabor, southeast of the Altar of Sha'tar.^Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor. Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss. Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself. I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons. We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not.The Cipher of Damnation^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Oronok Torn-heart^Earthmender Torlok^^The Cipher of Damnation - The First Frag, The Cipher of Damnation - The Second Fra, The Cipher of Damnation - The Third Frag^The Tempest Key^Use the Cipher of Damnation at the Altar of Damnation to summon Cyrukh the Firelord.^How many times has this spell been used in the history of our worlds? Undoubtedly, its power for destruction is unparalleled. What you must do now is take the cipher, now made whole, and read from it at the Altar of Damnation - where the memory of Gul'dan stands. What you will see once the words are uttered are the memories left imprinted upon the land. Stand your ground and await the coming of Cyrukh. You must be victorious, <name>. This land cannot withstand another shattering.Gaining Access^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Wing Commander Nuainn^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Bring a Legion Teleporter Control to Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold. The Mo'arg Weaponsmiths at Legion Hold are known to carry the devices.^According to Razuun's orders, the massive infernal staging area is called Invasion Point: Cataclysm and it's nestled in the northern mountains. The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter located at Legion Hold. Certain members of the Legion host carry devices allowing them to activate the teleporters. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the demons if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed.Prove Your Hatred^52^Horde^Paladin^Mehlar Dawnblade^Mehlar Dawnblade^To The Bulwark^^^Mehlar Dawnblade at the Bulwark wants you to bring him 20 Minion's Scourgestones.^It is time you remembered history that should not be forgotten... the slaughter of our people by Arthas and his Scourge army. Vengeance on the Scourge is the only way to ease your pain. It is unfortunate they are not susceptible to fear and pain. Only their utter destruction will bring you even a shred of satisfaction. Speak with Argent Officer Garush for knowledge of scourgestones and how to obtain them -- I will need to see many of them as proof of your commitment before we speak again.Wisdom of the Banshee Queen^52^Horde^Paladin^Mehlar Dawnblade^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^To The Bulwark^^^Bring the Scourgestone Fragments to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in Undercity.^The scourgestones are weak when separated from the skeletal grasp that once held them. Simply holding them in my hands has caused them to fracture and break. <Mehlar crushes the scourgestones into a pile of rubble.> Take these fragments to the Banshee Queen, Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, at her throne in Undercity. With her lies the knowledge to turn these remains into a weapon against the Scourge.Ancient Evil^52^Horde^Paladin^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Mehlar Dawnblade^To The Bulwark^^^Unlock the secrets of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar to release Atal'alarion and recover the Putrid Vine from his flesh. Return to Mehlar at the Bulwark when you have done this.^If you wish to turn these stones into a weapon to fight the Scourge, you must acquire something equally vile to fortify them. An ancient evil lies hidden at the bottom of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows. Release the creature there and destroy him, taking only a small part of his body back to Mehlar Dawnblade. My guards will deliver the scourgestone fragments to Mehlar.Gauging the Resonant Frequency^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome^Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome^Crystal Clear^^^Place the Oscillating Frequency Scanners in such a way that when you stand amongst them, you are hit by 5 overlapping Oscillation fields.^Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge. By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals. Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need! Your scanners will even work with those that others drop. Oh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed! I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst.Besieged!^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Blood Guard Gulmok^Kroghan's Report^^^Blood Guard Gulmok outside of Shadowmoon Village, wants you to kill 10 Infernal Attackers.^<Gulmok looks to the sky.> Our scouts are putting up a good fight, but the infernals keep coming! From their base of Legion Hold to the southwest, the demons bombard us with impunity! Even the elite Kor'kron guard cannot hold them off forever. I'm drafting every able-bodied <race> to do their part in defense of Shadowmoon Village. This is no game, <class>. The survival of the village is at stake. Do your duty to the Horde, and join the fray!To Legion Hold^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Blood Guard Gulmok^Kroghan's Report^^^Make your way to Legion Hold, locate the Legion Communication Device, and learn about the Legion's plans while in disguise. Return to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village when you've completed your mission.^The fortress of Legion Hold is your target. You'll have no reinforcements, so a frontal attack is out of the question. What little information we have shows that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and discover their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders.Setting Up the Bomb^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Blood Guard Gulmok^Kroghan's Report^^^Obtain a Fel Reaver Power Core and a Fel Reaver Armor Plate, then bring them to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.^We can't allow the Legion to trample us on their march to Black Temple. Find a way to destroy the infernals they intend to use against us. That's not a request, <name>; it's an order. The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the basis for a kind of fel bomb. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for a section of armor plating. You should be able to make a bomb powerful enough to take out those infernals and give the hold a nice shake!Blast the Infernals!^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Blood Guard Gulmok^Kroghan's Report^^^Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold to destroy the infernals, then report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.^The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power. If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.The Deathforge^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Scout Zagran^Kroghan's Report^^^Report to Scout Zagran at Slag Watch.^While you were taking care of the infernals at Legion Hold, I've been going over your reports. We've got no reason to believe the Legion lied about what's going on at the Deathforge. They're really cranking out infernals down there, so I've dispatched a scouting party to keep watch over it. If we don't shut down the Deathforge, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold. Report to Scout Zagran atop Slag Watch, to the southeast of here and overlooking the Deathforge.Minions of the Shadow Council^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Scout Zagran^Scout Zagran^Kroghan's Report^^The Fate of Kagrosh, The Summoning Chamber^Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to kill 10 Deathforge Guardians and 5 Deathforge Summoners.^<Zagran listens to you recount the events at Legion Hold, nodding.> That fills in the gaps we've seen. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that. The Shadow Council has the forge pretty much locked down. Looks like you're going to need to fight your way in. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!The Fate of Kagrosh^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Scout Zagran^Scout Zagran^^Minions of the Shadow Council^Bring Down the Warbringer!^Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to search the Deathforge for Kagrosh and recover Kagrosh's Pack.^The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, Kagrosh decided he wanted to be a hero. He descended into the Deathforge and we haven't heard from him since. In all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. The Shadow Council members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected.The Summoning Chamber^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Scout Zagran^Scout Zagran^^Minions of the Shadow Council^Bring Down the Warbringer!^Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. Report to Scout Zagran at Slag Watch when you've completed your task.^In order to churn out infernals as quickly as the Deathforge seems to, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the elementals that form the core of the infernals. The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.Bring Down the Warbringer!^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Scout Zagran^Blood Guard Gulmok^Bring Down the Warbringer!^The Fate of Kagrosh, The Summoning Chamber^^Defeat Warbringer Razuun, recover Razuun's Orders, and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.^We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job. I found a key among the items in Kagrosh's pack. At least he accomplished something before they got to him. The key should help you to track down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold. After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Blood Guard Gulmok. We must not keep him waiting.Gaining Access^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Blood Guard Gulmok^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Bring a Legion Teleporter Control to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. The Mo'arg Weaponsmiths at Legion Hold are known to carry the devices.^According to Razuun's orders, the massive infernal staging area is called Invasion Point: Cataclysm and it's located in the mountains behind our village! The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter at Legion Hold. Certain Legion minions carry a device allowing them to use the teleporter. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the demons if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed. Do not delay; the enemy is perilously close.Carendin Summons^20^All^Warlock^Alamma^Carendin Halgar^Carendin Summons^^^Speak with Carendin Halgar in Undercity.^You have a hungry look about you, <name>. Perhaps it is time you advanced your training. Travel to Undercity and speak with Carendin Halgar, the old bag of bones knows a trick or two you might find useful.The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Plexi^Plexi^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Kill Doctor Gutrick and obtain the Doctor's Key. Use the key to open the Doctor's Strongbox to retrieve The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance and deliver the book to Plexi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.^The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those Fel Reaver Sentinels below. There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Gutrick keeps locked in a chest at the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest!Whispers of the Raven God^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Timeon^Timeon^Creating the Pendant^^^Kill Grishna arakkoa to gain Understanding Ravenspeech for 2 minutes. While under the effects of the spell, you can find and receive the prophecy from the four shrines.^At Grishnath, totems left by the Oracles of the Raven enable the arakkoa to hear the Word of the Raven. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us. Using the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language. While you are suffused with the arakkoa's spirit, you can visit the totems and understand their message. Discover this for us, <name>.Crystal Clear^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome^Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome^Crystal Clear^^^Slay 10 Crystal Flayers.^The damned rock flayers are keeping me from my research down in the Singing Ridge! By digging at the crystals there, with every scratch they are ruining my chances of studying the harmonics of the singing crystals. You look like someone who can help me deal with this problem. Head south and clear those crystal flayers out.What Came First, the Drake or the Egg?^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Fizit "Doc" Clocktock^Fizit "Doc" Clocktock^^^^Collect 3 Proto-Nether Drake Essences, 3 Adolescent Drake Essences and 3 Mature Drake Essences.^I'm researching the applications of drake essences to my work as a physician. I think they could be a panacea for a host of maladies! I need someone to go south to the Singing Ridge and get me some. Willing to take my temporal phase modulator and use it on the nether whelps that hatch from the nether drake eggs? Retrieve the essences from whatever they turn into. Which, I might add, I'm not certain of what that will be as we're using some pretty dicey, time and space modifying tech here.The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Nakansi^Nakansi^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Kill Doctor Maleficus and obtain the Doctor's Key. Use the key to open the Doctor's Strongbox to retrieve The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance and deliver the book to Nakansi at Invasion Point Cataclysm.^The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those Fel Reaver Sentinels below. There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Maleficus keeps locked in a chest near the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest.The Fel and the Furious^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Plexi^Plexi^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Use a Fel Reaver Control Console to take control of a Fel Reaver Sentinel. Destroy 60 Deathforged Infernals before your fel reaver fails. When your mission is complete, report to Plexi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.^<Plexi leafs through the manual.> Well, this has everything we need, but there's just one problem. Fel Reavers aren't really built to respond to remote control. We can modify one for you to use for a short time, but you'll have to work fast, or there's no telling what might happen! I wouldn't be surprised if your little stunt with the fel reaver catches the attention of the Legion's lackeys, either. Keep an eye out, and whatever you do, don't forget to destroy as much as you can!The Fel and the Furious^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Nakansi^Nakansi^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Use a Fel Reaver Control Console to take control of a Fel Reaver Sentinel. Destroy 60 Deathforged Infernals before your fel reaver fails. When your mission is complete, report to Nakansi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.^<Nakansi leafs through the manual.> All the information is here, but be warned. These things weren't built to be controlled remotely. We can modify one for you to use for a short time, but you'll have to work fast, or there's no telling what might happen! I wouldn't be surprised if your little stunt with the fel reaver catches the attention of the Legion scum, either. Try to keep yourself safe, but remember, the mission and the safety of Shadowmoon Village come first!Whispers on the Wind^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Leoroxx^The Spirits Have Voices^^^Speak with Leoroxx at the Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^I have chased rumors of the Mok'Nathal across Outland with nothing to show for it. Finally, we may have found their home. But now that the moment is here, I am filled with unease. Unease that has kept me awake deep into the nights during my search. Will they accept me? I... know their leader's name: Leoroxx. Seek him out. You must be my eyes in this.Ruuan Weald^64^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Dertrok^Timeon^Trial and Error^^^Speak with Timeon at Evergrove, which is in the Ruuan Weald in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^The information you have helped me reveal about the nature of the arakkoa here will be of great interest to another. We were visited by members of the Cenarion Expedition, who have also become concerned with the arakkoa's intentions here in the Blade's Edge Mountains. You should seek him out. His name is Timeon, and you will find him at Evergrove in Ruuan Weald. Follow the road west from here, then north when it forks in Razor Ridge. Finally, follow the road west when it splits in the Bladed Gulch.Silkwing Cocoons^66^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Taerek^Taerek^^^^Collect 8 Silkwing Cocoons from Silkwing Larva.^The silk from the cocoons of the silkwings are used for all manner of things in the village. We can never get enough, and we never have enough. It is difficult to harvest the cocoons from the larva once they begin the process of metamorphosis. Our warriors are occupied with the assault on our village. If you could gather these for us, that would be helpful.The Softest Wings^65^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Silmara^Silmara^^^^Collect 12 Iridescent Wings.^Hunting silkwing larva is a difficult challenge for our young warriors, but luckily, even if they fail to harvest the cocoon from the larva, we can still use the wings of hatched silkwings. In fact, we use the wings for much more than the cocoons, and we can never have too many. If you'll be out there, it would be a great help if you could bring me some.The Ashtongue Tribe^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Vindicator Aluumen^Vindicator Aluumen^The Ashtongue Tribe^^Reclaiming Holy Grounds^Vindicator Aluumen wants you to go to the Ruins of Baa'ri and slay 3 Ashtongue Handlers, 4 Ashtongue Warriors and 6 Ashtongue Shaman.^The Ashtongue tribe is feared among all Broken. It consists of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by Akama himself. They are as fierce and ruthless as any naga, demon or blood elf in Illidan's army and they have been deployed in large numbers at the Ruins of Baa'ri, southwest of here. Go there and put a dent in their numbers before they get a chance to mount an attack on us.Ridgespine Menace^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Dizzy Dina^Dizzy Dina^^Picking Up Some Power Converters^More than a Pound of Flesh^Slay 10 Ridgespine Stalkers.^We hired on to help Toshley when he decided to move to Outland, and we've been on the move ever since. Now it looks like we've finally put down some roots. All of the crazy scientists have their projects going, and us Roughriders are here to protect them. What we need right now is for you to go north into Razor Ridge, or east to the Scalewing Shelf, and keep them clear by killing the stalkers. They're stealthy spiders that live amongst the rock outcroppings, and jump unsuspecting passersby.Illidari-Bane Shard^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Illidari-Bane Shard^Ordinn Thunderfist^Illidari-Bane Shard^^^Bring the Illidari-Bane Shard to Ordinn Thunderfist at Wildhammer Stronghold.^The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light. The weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Wildhammer Stronghold might be able to tell you more about it.Proof of Allegiance^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Sanoru^Sanoru^Tablets of Baa'ri^^^Slay Zandras at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley and return to Sanoru.^Akama has been tracking your progress quite closely, <name>. The Ashtongue you've slain at the Ruins of Baa'ri are amongst the most evil Broken known among us... carefully hand-picked by Akama himself to maintain the facade we need to present to Illidan. The Deathsworn, however, know of Akama's true intentions. First things first. We need to know that you are not with Illidan. A Satyr known as Zandras watches over us from above the prison walls on his behalf. Slay him as proof of your allegiance.Illidari-Bane Shard^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Illidari-Bane Shard^Grokom Deatheye^Illidari-Bane Shard^^^Bring the Illidari-Bane Shard to Grokom Deatheye at Shadowmoon Village.^The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light. The weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Shadowmoon Village might be able to tell you more about it.A Haunted History^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^^^Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring her 15 Ever-burning Ash samples.^Have you felt the cold chill? Perhaps what you thought was a hand on your shoulder? That was not your mind playing tricks on you, <race>. The land is haunted. Ghosts litter the landscape, stuck here for all eternity. Would you like to see them? Are you sure about that? These types of things tend to change a person - and not for the better. Very well, I will need you to collect for me the ever-burning ash that is found near any of the fel lava pools of western Shadowmoon. Anywhere near green lava...Spectrecles^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^^^Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to slay 12 Shadowmoon Zealots.^I call them "Spectrecles." Clever, no? When you equip these goggles, you will be able to see the spirits of Shadowmoon Valley. Before I let you have them, though, you must promise me that you will help us clear out the ghosts at the village. Take the goggles and destroy any and all spirits that you see wandering about Shadowmoon Village. Hopefully, destroying these spirits will force any that remain to move elsewhere.Capture the Weapons^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Ordinn Thunderfist^Ordinn Thunderfist^Illidari-Bane Shard^^The Hermit Smith^Ordinn Thunderfist at Wildhammer Stronghold wants you to bring him Mazakradon's Glaive and Morgroron's Glaive.^With a larger supply of this material, we might be able to forge a weapon for you to use. The two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. We have no way of knowing how many more the Legion intends to produce, but if we can capture these prototypes, there should be enough for our project. <Ordinn grins.> There's a certain amount of satisfaction in using the Legion's own 'secret weapons' against them, don't you think?Capture the Weapons^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Grokom Deatheye^Grokom Deatheye^Illidari-Bane Shard^^The Hermit Smith^Grokom Deatheye at Shadowmoon Village wants you to bring him Mazakradon's Glaive and Morgroron's Glaive.^With a larger supply of this material, I can forge a weapon suitable for you. The two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. Capturing those two weapons should provide us with enough material to make your weapon, and then some. I can't wait to bring the battle to the enemy using these weapons. That'll teach the Legion to trifle with anti-demon magics.Akama^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Sanoru^Akama^Tablets of Baa'ri^^Seer Udalo^Speak to Akama inside the hidden chamber in the Warden's Cage.^You've proven what side you're on. I will reveal to you our leader's hideout. Follow the halls beyond; there will be an underground passage hidden by stagnant water on your right. I must warn you, <name>. You are not to speak to anyone of what you see there.Shizz Work^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Razelcraz^Foreman Razelcraz^Outland Sucks!^^^Use the Felhound Whistle to summon a Fel Guard Hound. Take the Fel Guard Hound for a walk and kill some Deranged Helboars. Search for the Shredder Keys in the Fel Guard Hound's "leavings." Return the Shredder Keys to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.^I finally got my shredder working but I seem to have lost the keys. I keep a pack of felhounds to protect my camp. They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot. They also like shiny things. I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys. I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk. Kill some helboars and let him eat. He'll do his business. When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his "leavings."Beneath Thrallmar^61^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Foreman Razelcraz^Foreman Razelcraz^Outland Sucks!^^^Kill Urga'zz and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.^I'm almost back in business. Problem is all these gan'arg are in my mine. I can't send my peons in and even once I fix this shredder I wouldn't want to risk it in combat. Deep down in the mine the gan'arg have a leader. If you kill him maybe the gan'arg will leave. Then I could make some money and buy my way out of here.Cutting Your Teeth^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Razak Ironsides^Razak Ironsides^^Picking Up Some Power Converters^^Collect 5 Extra Sharp Daggermaw Teeth.^It's nice that you've been helping out Toshley and his scientists. I, however, do not have the luxury of indulging in my 'personal' interests. If you want to make a difference around here, you'll do what I ask of you, and right now, I need weapons. Our guns are effective at range, but when the bugs get in close, we need to have powerful melee weapons as a backup. The teeth of the daggermaw lashtails in the northern part of the Razor Ridge make for great vibro-weapon blades. Scare me up some.Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^^Divination: Gorefiend's Armor, Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak^Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to find the Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit.^Stories abound about the life of Teron Gorefiend, but most are just that - stories. We do not know what happened to Gorefiend after he returned to Draenor. The only thing we are certain of is that he has already died once. I have heard the scouts here speaking of an ancient orc spirit that resides at the Altar of Shadows, far to the southeast, across the Netherwing Fields and through Netherwing Pass. Take the Spectrecles and track this orc down. He will surely have more information on Gorefiend.Divination: Gorefiend's Armor^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^^Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend^Teron Gorefiend, I am..., Teron Gorefiend, I am...^The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Armor.^In life, Gorefiend was a monster, but in death, Gorefiend was an unmitigated terror. To the southeast you will find Netherwing Ledge. What was once part of the mainland of Shadowmoon is now a floating island in the sky. Vhel'kur, spawn of Deathwing, once called it his home, but now knows it as his grave. He flies an endless circle above the island, seething at his defeat to Gorefiend. If you are to recover the Gorefiend's armor, it is Vhel'kur that you must defeat.Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^^Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend^^The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Cloak.^Many a cruel act he committed but none so cold as the slaughter of the clerics of Karabor. After Gul'dan's Horde defeated the draenei of Karabor, the surviving clerics of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to Hellfire Citadel as prisoners of war. Gorefiend, not yet a death knight, murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood. They now roam in front of the Black Temple with vengeance in their hearts. It is the clerics of Karabor that hold the cloak of Gorefiend.Divination: Gorefiend's Truncheon^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^^^^The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit at the Altar of Shadows in southeast Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Gorefiend's Truncheon.^One by one they knelt before him, offering their lives as a show of allegiance. Gorefiend hoisted his sickle and cut clean their heads. Shortly after this slaughter, Gorefiend took his own life. But this was no act of contrition! No, Gorefiend sought immortality! From the corpses of the fallen death knights rose the Ghostriders of Karabor. They now ride the roads encircling the Hand of Guldan, awaiting the day that their master returns. It is they who hold the truncheon of Gorefiend. Retrieve it...A Necessary Distraction^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Exarch Onaala^Exarch Onaala^Karabor Training Grounds^^^Exarch Onaala wants you to return to the Ruins of Karabor and find a way to unleash Azaloth on his captors.^The weapons are authentic, as we feared. Illidan is training demon hunters at the Ruins of Karabor and we must put an end to it. Do not be fooled by their name, <name>, their power will be used against us as often as against any demon. Their warlocks summon and subdue demons to be used as part of the initiates' training. A pit lord named Azaloth has proven too strong to be used in training and is kept banished. Find a way to let him loose on his captors. That should buy us the time we need.Teron Gorefiend, I am...^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^^Divination: Gorefiend's Armor^^The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit has used you as a pawn! Now that you have collected the items he required, he has revealed himself to be Teron Gorefiend. To break free of his possession, you must do his bidding and slay Karsius the Ancient Watcher.^With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host. <The ancient shadowmoon spirit's lips curl up to form a wicked grin.> Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The Altar of Shadows is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds. Refuse and we will both be stuck here forever. Teron Gorefiend will be free!Altruis^70^All^Nagrand^Exarch Onaala^Altruis the Sufferer^Karabor Training Grounds^^Against the Illidari, Against All Odds^Travel to western Nagrand and find Altruis the Sufferer.^It is rare in this day and age to hear of those who follow the path of the demon hunter. It is rarer still to find someone who does and has no allegiance to Illidan. There are rumors of one such individual here in Outland. One name is said to be feared in the Legion fields of Nagrand more than any army of Aldor vindicators. That name is Altruis. Go to western Nagrand and find him. He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds.Against the Legion^70^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^^Forge Camp: Annihilated^Illidan's Pupil^Altruis the Sufferer wants you to obtain Freshly Drawn Blood from a Wrath Priestess at Forge Base: Gehenna in Netherstorm. Spill it on the ground and slay the Avatar of Sathal. Return to Altruis when you've completed this task.^The Burning Legion has proven its capacity to corrupt mortal souls time and again. If I'm to entrust you with the knowledge you seek, I must have proof of your allegiance. A demoness known as Sathal has eluded me for a long time as she's gifted with an incorporeal form. She watches over the wrath priestesses as they do her bidding at Forge Base: Gehenna. Slay one of her minions and spill her blood on the ground. This affront should cause Sathal to materialize temporarily. Slay her while you can.A Ghost in the Machine^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Zorus the Judicator^Zorus the Judicator^Zorus the Judicator^^^Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 15 Ever-burning Ash samples.^I fear that these dwarves do not understand what they have built upon. This area was once the ancestral grounds for the Shadowmoon orcs. I speak of spirits, <race>. For nearly twenty years they have laid dormant beneath the Wildhammer Stronghold, but recently, something has riled them up. Venture beyond the gates of Wildhammer and seek out the pools and rivers of fel lava found across this land. Near the lava will be ever-burning ash. Bring me this ash so that I may craft something that will help us.Harbingers of Shadowmoon^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Zorus the Judicator^Zorus the Judicator^Zorus the Judicator^^^Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to slay 12 Shadowmoon Harbingers.^Let it be known that Zorus does have a sense of humor. Enough small talk. Don the Spectrecles so that you are able to see the Shadowmoon orc spirits that wander this stronghold. Do not be frightened as we are truly the invaders here. Alas, they must be destroyed, for their time has long since passed. Destroy the Shadowmoon harbingers infesting Wildhammer Stronghold and return to me.Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Zorus the Judicator^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Zorus the Judicator^^Divination: Gorefiend's Armor, Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak^Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to find the Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit.^Stories abound about the life of Teron Gorefiend, but most are just that - stories. We do not know what happened to Gorefiend after he returned to Draenor. The only thing we are certain of is that he has already died once. I have heard the scouts here speaking of an ancient orc spirit that resides at the Altar of Shadows, far to the east, across the Netherwing Fields and through Netherwing Pass. Take the Spectrecles and track this orc down. He will surely have more information on Gorefiend.Teron Gorefiend, I am...^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit^Zorus the Judicator^^Divination: Gorefiend's Armor^^The Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit has used you as a pawn! Now that you have collected the items he required, he has revealed himself to be Teron Gorefiend. To break free of his possession, you must do his bidding and slay Karsius the Ancient Watcher.^With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host. <The ancient shadowmoon spirit's lips curl up to form a wicked grin.> Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The Altar of Shadows is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds. Refuse and we will both be stuck here forever. Teron Gorefiend will be free!Illidan's Pupil^70^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^Illidan's Pupil^Against the Legion, Against the Illidari, Against All Odds^^Listen to Altruis's story.^You've proven your allegiance, <name>. You must forgive my caution, but in this world things are not what they appear. I will tell you about Varedis when you're ready.Wanted: Uvuros, Scourge of Shadowmoon^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Wanted Poster^Warcaller Sardon Truslice^^^^Slay Uvuros and recover Uvuros's Fiery Mane. Return it to Warcaller Sardon Truslice at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley.^Wanted - DEAD: Uvuros, scourge of Shadowmoon Valley. By order of Overlord Or'barokh, the fel beast, Uvuros, is to be killed on sight and his mane stripped from his carcass as proof of deed. Return the fiery mane of the beast to Warcaller Sardon Truslice should you succeed. Uvuros was last seen at the Hand of Gul'dan, located in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - east of Shadowmoon Village.Wanted: Uvuros, Scourge of Shadowmoon^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wanted Poster^Warcaller Beersnout^^^^Slay Uvuros and recover Uvuros's Fiery Mane. Return it to Warcaller Beersnout at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley.^Wanted - DEAD: Uvuros, scourge of Shadowmoon Valley. By order of Thane Yoregar, the fel beast, Uvuros, is to be killed on sight and his mane stripped from his carcass as proof of deed. Return the fiery mane of the beast to Warcaller Beersnout should you succeed. Uvuros was last seen at the Hand of Gul'dan, located in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - northeast of Wildhammer Stronghold.The Book of Fel Names^70^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^Illidan's Pupil^^Return to the Aldor, Return to the Scryers^Venture inside the Shadow Labyrinth in Auchindoun and obtain the Book of Fel Names from Blackheart the Inciter. Return to Altruis in Nagrand once you've completed this task.^I sympathize with your intentions of stopping Varedis and his followers, but you won't stand a chance against him. That is, unless you find the artifact that gave him his power. The Book of Fel Names is rumored to be in the possession of Blackheart the Inciter inside the Shadow Labyrinth in Auchindoun. Obtaining it will be your only hope against Varedis.Return to the Aldor^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Altruis the Sufferer^Exarch Onaala^Return to the Aldor^The Book of Fel Names^^Speak with Exarch Onaala at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley.^This book... I could use it to increase my power tenfold... No! It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of. Return to those who sent you here, <name>. You now have the means to stop Varedis. Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence. That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power.Varedis Must Be Stopped^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Exarch Onaala^Exarch Onaala^Return to the Aldor^^^Exarch Onaala wants you to go to the ruins of Karabor and slay Alandien, Theras, Netharel and Varedis. Use the Book of Fel Names when Varedis uses Metamorphosis to weaken him. Return to Exarch Onaala with the Book of Fel Names after you've completed this task.^We must dispose of this foul artifact, but not before we use it to dispose of Varedis's powers. We need to permanently shut down the Ruins of Karabor training grounds, which will mean killing not only Varedis but also the three night elf masters that assist him: Alandien, Theras and Netharel. Gather a suitable force and return to the Ruins of Karabor. Follow Altruis's instructions for defeating Varedis. For all of our sakes, I hope they work.Behind Enemy Lines^69^All^Netherstorm^Veronia^Caledis Brightdawn^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Speak to Veronia when you're ready to depart to Manaforge Coruu. Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn.^All arrangements have been made to take you to where our spies are hiding. Just come see me when you're ready and we'll get you on your way.Marks of Sargeras^70^All^Shattrath City^Adyen the Lightwarden^Adyen the Lightwarden^^^More Marks of Sargeras, Single Mark of Sargeras^Bring 10 Marks of Sargeras to Adyen the Lightwarden in Shattrath City.^By now it should be clear to you why we oppose the Burning Legion and those who serve them. If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of high-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. The highest-ranking Legion can be found in Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley.Sunfury Signets^70^All^Shattrath City^Magistrix Fyalenn^Magistrix Fyalenn^^^More Sunfury Signets, Single Sunfury Signet^Magistrix Fyalenn in Shattrath City wants you to bring her 10 Sunfury Signets.^As you might know, the Scryers and the armies of Kael'thas are at war. Kael sees us as a threat to his influence over other blood elves and has tried to crush us time and again. If you wish to aid us in our battle against Kael'thas, there are plenty of targets for you to go after. Kael's highest ranking soldiers wear Sunfury signets to mark their ranks. You will find them all over Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley.Ride the Lightning^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Toshley^Toshley^Picking Up Some Power Converters^^^Use the Repolarized Magneto Sphere to absorb 25 lightning strikes from the Scalewing Serpents. Also, collect 5 Scalewing Lightning Glands.^We haven't kept the use of the Zephyrium Capacitorium under budget. But, it occurs to me that the serpents of the Scalewing Shelf to the east have a lightning breath and glands that we can make use of. I've repolarized the magneto collector to absorb lightning strikes and I want you to head up there, activate it on yourself, and get us some cheap fuel from those serpents.What Strange Creatures...^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Researcher Tiorus^Researcher Tiorus^What Strange Creatures...^^^Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.^I am interested in learning more about the strange reptiles that mill about the lava flows of Shadowmoon Valley. Never have I seen beasts able to withstand the searing heat of molten lava! Outside of Shadowmoon Village, where the ground has ruptured and lava flows through the cracks, you will find felfire diemetradons. Slay them and bring me their spleens. From their spleens I will be able to begin preliminary analysis of their resistance to heat. Begin your search to the southeast.Spleendid!^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Gnomus^Gnomus^Spleendid!^^^Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 8 Felfire Spleens.^Have you ever heard of food that cooks itself and stays hot forever? Dare to dream, I say! But maybe it's not a dream at all! Outside the fortress, near the lava pools and streams, you can find beasts that thrive in the sizzling heat. They're called felfire diemetradons. The dwarves around here tell me that those diemetradons have the tastiest spleens ever and that the spleens practically come pre-cooked! Bring me those spleens and I'll give you some coin. Start your search directly east of here.The Hermit Smith^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Ordinn Thunderfist^David Wayne^The Hermit Smith^Capture the Weapons^Additional Materials^Bring the Box of Ingots to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge in Terokkar Forest.^<Ordinn examines the results from his attempt at smithing the metal and shakes his head.> This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated for your use. There was a talented smith who accompanied the Sons of Lothar to Draenor, David Wayne. He was a remarkable blacksmith, but chose to leave the expedition. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you with the weapon.The Hermit Smith^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Grokom Deatheye^David Wayne^The Hermit Smith^Capture the Weapons^Additional Materials^Bring the Box of Ingots to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge in Terokkar Forest.^<The orc shakes his head at his failure.> This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated. It pains me to suggest this, but your only hope may be a human smith by the name of David Wayne. It's true he was once a member of the Alliance's expedition, but that was a long time ago and he has since left the Sons of Lothar. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you.Additional Materials^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^The Hermit Smith^^Fresh from the Mechanar, The Lexicon Demonica^David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge wants you to bring him an Adamantite Frame, 4 Heavy Knothide Leather, and a Demon Warding Totem.^The ingots that you brought contain most of the metal I'll need to forge the sword's blade, but I'll need a variety of things to create other parts of the weapon. Let's see, among the things I don't have here are an adamantite frame, some heavy knothide leather, and a demon warding totem. Skilled crafters should be able to produce the first two, but the third is only sold by the reagent vendor in Shattrath's Lower City, Fantei. You'll find him with the other tradesmen.Fresh from the Mechanar^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^^Additional Materials^Underworld Loam, Tear of the Earthmother^David Wayne at Wayne's Retreat wants you to bring him an Overcharged Manacell.^Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat -- rather more than a conventional forge can supply. I'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power. The Mechanar area of Tempest Keep turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around Mechano-Lord Capacitus and bring it back here.The Lexicon Demonica^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^^Additional Materials^Underworld Loam, Tear of the Earthmother^Obtain the Lexicon Demonica from Grandmaster Vorpil and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.^Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic. It's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful Shadow Council warlock. Deep in the halls of Auchindoun's Shadow Labyrinth, it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me.Underworld Loam^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^^Fresh from the Mechanar, The Lexicon Demonica^Bane of the Illidari^Get a Vial of Underworld Loam from Hydromancer Thespia and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.^The frame that you brought me earlier will not be sufficient to hold molten metal without reinforcement. A rare kind of earth can be used to cool and imbue the frame, giving the adamantite an unnatural strength. Underwold loam, as the earth is known, is accorded great value among the naga. Few enough of them possess it, and in Outland, I know of only one naga who uses it -- Hydromancer Thespia, who resides in the Steamvault of Coilfang Reservoir.Against the Illidari^70^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^^Altruis^Illidan's Pupil^Altruis the Sufferer wants you to slay Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.^I still have respect for Illidan. Without him I would not have found my path. He is not who he once was, however. His soul has been corrupted by power, his mind has been twisted by defeat. He has become what I am sworn to destroy and his pet servants, the Illidari, are as much of an abomination as any demon of the Burning Legion. His grasp on Outland is slipping yet his reach is still vast. Prove you're not with him by slaying his lieutenant Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.Against All Odds^70^All^Nagrand^Altruis the Sufferer^Altruis the Sufferer^^Altruis^Illidan's Pupil^Altruis the Sufferer wants you to take the Imbued Silver Spear and use it at Portal Clearing near Marshlight Lake in Zangarmarsh to awake Xeleth. Return to Altruis after you've slain the demon.^Some demons pledge allegiance to no one but themselves. A true enemy of demons finds and destroys his prey regardless of affiliation, however. The demon Xeleth - a Legion defector - was once worshipped as a god by primitive swamp creatures in Zangarmarsh. When Draenor was nearly destroyed, he retreated into a slumber deep beneath Marshlight Lake. Find the portal at the lake and plant this spear into the ground. Xeleth will awake - be ready to slay him and prove you're an enemy to all demons.Tear of the Earthmother^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^^Fresh from the Mechanar, The Lexicon Demonica^Bane of the Illidari^Recover the Tear of the Earthmother from Warbringer O'mrogg and return it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.^The sword's enchantments must be contained within a powerful focus, such as a gem. I know of a gem that we can use for this purpose, for there are few that can play host to such powerful magics without shattering. The gem we need is called the tear of the earthmother. It's a powerful artifact in the hands of the ogres who created it, and Warbringer O'mrogg, who currently holds the gem, has many powerful allies in Hellfire Citadel's Shattered Halls. Take care in retrieving the tear, <name>.More than a Pound of Flesh^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Dizzy Dina^Dizzy Dina^^Ridgespine Menace^^Collect 5 Ether-Energized Flesh.^<name>, I've got something else for you to do. One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge. More to the point, they want to study the flesh of the flesh beasts that are there. <Dizzy makes a disgusted face.> But, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have. I say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do?Frankly, It Makes No Sense...^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Researcher Tiorus^Researcher Tiorus^What Strange Creatures...^^^Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to travel to the lava flow near the Ruins of Baa'ri and use the Arcano Control Unit to control an Arcano-Scorp, swim in the lava with the Arcano-Scorp, and tag 8 Greater Felfire Diemetradons.^We must study these creatures further. Far to the east - near the huge lava flow beneath the ruins of Baa'ri - you will find arcano control units. These controllers were crafted by a genius named Gnomus for the sole purpose of exploring lava via mechanical scorpion. He has long since lost his mind and is now only interested in eating the hottest food known to gnome-kind. <Tiorus gives you a funny look.> I want you to use the control and tag the diemetradons of the lava flow for further study.Felspine the Greater^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Researcher Tiorus^Researcher Tiorus^What Strange Creatures...^^^Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill Felspine the Greater and recover Felspine's Hide.^Gnomus knows about the massive diemetradon and plans to eat it! He must have been able to see what I could see through the eyes of his arcano-scorp. Look, there's no time to explain. He's crazy and that craziness is going to cost us the closest thing we've got to a fireproof jumpsuit. Get back to the lava flow near Baa'ri and track down Felspine the Greater. Once you find it, kill it and bring me back its hide. Don't try and reason with me, <name>. I'm well past that point.Trapping the Light Fantastic^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Toshley^Toshley^Picking Up Some Power Converters^^^Use the Light Trap to collect 15 Razaani Light Orbs.^The Razaani ethereals have been playing with some interesting technology at Razaan's Landing to the north. I'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs? They're probably only for decoration anyway. The trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it. Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence.Show Them Gnome Mercy!^68^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Toshley^Toshley^Picking Up Some Power Converters^^^Collect the Collection of Souls.^<The blood drains out of Toshley's face.> These orbs are made up of both nether energy and souls, some of them gnome souls! How dare they! Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north?! <name>, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan. You'll have to coax him out of hiding though. I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani ethereal. Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has.Bane of the Illidari^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^Bane of the Illidari^Underworld Loam, Tear of the Earthmother^^Wait for David Wayne to finish forging a sword for you.^<David gathers his smithing supplies.> You've done well in getting everything we'll need to reforge the anti-demon blade. Your hard work and dedication is about to be repaid. The time has come to forge the sword.The Second Course...^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Gnomus^Gnomus^Spleendid!^^^Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 1 Overdeveloped Felfire Gizzard.^I remember seeing larger diemetradons east of the Hand of Gul'dan, near the lava flows around the Ruins of Baa'ri. What I want you to get for me now is one overdeveloped felfire gizzard from the beasts around that area. You might have to kill several to find a gizzard like the one I described. Keep at it! One of them is bound to have my next meal.The Main Course!^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Gnomus^Gnomus^Spleendid!^^^Gnomus at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover Felspine's Hide.^Long story short, I used to work with a blood elf named Tiorus. My partnership with Tiorus dissolved once I got into gourmet living. He decided to take it upon himself to continue our research using MY inventions. Anyhow, he had some of his Horde goons using my arcano-scorp probes at the Ruins of Baa'ri lava flow and discovered the mother of all diemetradons! I need you to get there before he does and kill the diemetradon, Felspine, and bring his hide back to me. Hurry up!Quenching the Blade^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^David Wayne^David Wayne^Bane of the Illidari^^^Travel to the Scalding Pools located near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan and use the Forged Illidari-Bane Blade to quench it in the lava pools. Once you have the Quenched Illidari-Bane Blade, return to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.^The blade is nearly finished! You can almost feel the magic beginning to coalesce inside the steel, but one thing remains to be done. You must take the forged blade to the Scalding Pools near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan in Shadowmoon Valley and plunge it into the lava pools to quench the sword. When you have quenched the sword, return.The Hand of Gul'dan^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Sophurus^Earthmender Torlok^The Hand of Gul'dan^^Enraged Spirits of Fire and Earth^Speak with Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley.^The elements need your help, <race>! Shadowmoon Valley has been subject to unspeakable evils. The spirits remain tortured to this day. Many are enraged and unwilling to commune with the Earthen Ring. Help this world heal, friend. Directly northeast of Wildhammer Stronghold you will find an area known as the Altar of Damnation. Make your way there and speak with Earthmender Torlok.The Hand of Gul'dan^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Earthmender Splinthoof^Earthmender Torlok^The Hand of Gul'dan^^Enraged Spirits of Fire and Earth^Speak with Earthmender Torlok at the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley.^The elements need your help, <race>! Shadowmoon Valley has been subject to unspeakable evils. The spirits remain tortured to this day. Many are enraged and unwilling to commune with the Earthen Ring. Help this world heal, friend. Southeast of Shadowmoon Village - in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - you will find an area known as the Altar of Damnation. Make your way there and speak with Earthmender Torlok.A Time for Negotiation...^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tree Warden Chawn^Tree Warden Chawn^A Time for Negotiation...^^Poaching from Poachers^Negotiate with Overseer Nuaar.^When we arrived in the Ruuan Weald, the wyrm cultists were keeping themselves to Blackwing Coven, through the tunnel to the west. But now, they are encroaching upon us here. I need you to find the wyrmcultists' overseer. He's known to make a regular patrol between their various camps in the Ruuan Weald. Negotiate with him. Let him know that there's room for compromise, but that we will not condone or allow the wholesale slaughter of the wildlife, nor the felling of all of the trees.Tablets of Baa'ri^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Arcanist Thelis^Arcanist Thelis^Tablets of Baa'ri^^Oronu the Elder^Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to collect 12 Baa'ri Tablets from the ground and from Ashtongue Workers at the Ruins of Baa'ri.^The Ashtongue Broken have been ordered by Illidan to excavate the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the far north. They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion. We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor... a place you might know as the Black Temple.Oronu the Elder^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Arcanist Thelis^Arcanist Thelis^Tablets of Baa'ri^^^Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to obtain the Orders from Akama from Oronu the Elder at the Ruins of Baa'ri.^According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri. Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor. We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet. Its power would provide great aid in our fight against Illidan. Akama's lieutenant at Baa'ri, Oronu the Elder, receives written orders from him daily. Obtain them and bring them to me.The Ashtongue Corruptors^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Arcanist Thelis^Arcanist Thelis^Tablets of Baa'ri^^^Obtain the four medallion fragments from Haalum, Eykenen, Lakaan and Uylaru and return to Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley.^According to Akama's letter, four fragments of the medallion were unearthed and given to the Ashtongue Corruptors. These dreaded Broken were once powerful shaman who now defile the very elements they revered. Haalum, Corruptor of Air, can be found at Netherwing Pass. Eykenen and Uylaru, Corruptors of Earth and Fire, were last seen at the Fel Pits near the Hand of Gul'dan. Lakaan, Corruptor of Water, is rumored to be near Coilskar Point. Find them and obtain the medallion fragments.The Warden's Cage^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Arcanist Thelis^Sanoru^Tablets of Baa'ri^^Proof of Allegiance^Arcanist Thelis wants you to enter the Warden's Cage, south of the Ruins of Baa'ri and interrogate Sanoru on Akama's whereabouts.^The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion. The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half. I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning. He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage. I want you to find that dreaded prison, and find the whereabouts of Akama. His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to.Karabor Training Grounds^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Larissa Sunstrike^Larissa Sunstrike^Karabor Training Grounds^^^Larissa Sunstrike at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to obtain 8 Sunfury Glaives from the Demon Hunter Supplicants and Demon Hunter Initiates at the Ruins of Karabor, northeast of the Sanctum of the Stars.^Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor. Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss. Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself. I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons. We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not.A Necessary Distraction^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Larissa Sunstrike^Larissa Sunstrike^Karabor Training Grounds^^^Larissa Sunstrike wants you to return to the Ruins of Karabor and find a way to unleash Azaloth on his captors.^The weapons are authentic, as we feared. Illidan is training demon hunters at the Ruins of Karabor and we must put an end to it. Do not be fooled by their name, <name>, their power will be used against us as often as against any demon. Their warlocks summon and subdue demons to be used as part of the initiates' training. A pit lord named Azaloth has proven too strong to be used in training and is kept banished. Find a way to let him loose on his captors. That should buy us the time we need.Altruis^70^All^Nagrand^Larissa Sunstrike^Altruis the Sufferer^Karabor Training Grounds^^Against the Illidari, Against All Odds^Travel to western Nagrand and find Altruis the Sufferer.^You don't see many demon hunters nowawdays. They're viewed with suspicion by their own people and it's very rare to find one that doesn't have some sort of allegiance to Illidan. There are rumors of one such demon hunter out in Nagrand. His name is Altruis. He hates all demons with a passion and will help us if you can convince him that you share his goals. Go to western Nagrand and find him. He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds.The Den Mother^66^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Wanted Poster^Commander Skyshadow^^^^Slay Rema.^WANTED! Rema, the den mother and primary defender of the Jagged Ridge south of Thunderlord Stronghold. Find her by heading east out of town and across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine. She keeps herself secluded in the tunnel at the southern edge of the ridge. Return with news of her demise to Commander Skyshadow of Sylvanaar.Return to the Scryers^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Altruis the Sufferer^Larissa Sunstrike^Return to the Scryers^The Book of Fel Names^^Speak with Larissa Sunstrike at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley.^This book... I could use it to increase my power tenfold... No! It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of. Return to those who sent you here, <name>. You now have the means to stop Varedis. Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence. That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power.Varedis Must Be Stopped^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Larissa Sunstrike^Larissa Sunstrike^Return to the Scryers^^^Larissa Sunstrike wants you to go to the ruins of Karabor and slay Alandien, Theras, Netharel and Varedis. Use the Book of Fel Names when Varedis uses Metamorphosis to weaken him. Return to Larissa Sunstrike with the Book of Fel Names after completing this task.^Of course we must destroy this book, but not before we use it to destroy Varedis. If we're to shut down this academy of Illidan imitators, we'll have to deal not just with Varedis but also the three night elf masters that assist him: Alandien, Theras and Netharel. Gather a suitable force and return to the Ruins of Karabor. Follow Altruis's instructions for defeating Varedis. Hopefully his plan will work - otherwise... it'll have been a pleasure working with you.Breaking Down Netherock^68^All^Netherstorm^Wanted Poster^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^^^^Slay Netherock and then report in with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^To whomever cares about the timely construction of the X-52 Nether-Rocket -- The king of the local mountain giants, Netherock, has been terrorizing the Crumbling Wastes. He's been interfering with operations all along the south ledge of the island! Take your friends and deal with him! Then, return to me here in Area 52. Rocket-Chief FuselageA Grunt's Work...^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Or'barokh^Overlord Or'barokh^^^^Overlord Or'barokh at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill 20 Shadowmoon Valley Wildlife.^All Horde forces in this region have been dispatched to handle the attacks from the Burning Legion. This means that we are short-handed for grunt work. Our supply caravans are in constant danger from the wildlife of the region. We can't veer 15 feet off the road without running into a chimaera, felboar, or abnormally large scorpion. Get out there and clear Shadowmoon Valley of its sadistic wildlife! Just kill 'em all!Put On Yer Kneepads...^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Thane Yoregar^Thane Yoregar^^^^Thane Yoregar at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill 20 Shadowmoon Valley Wildlife.^It's time to get down in the muck and get dirty. What were you expectin'? You gotta learn to walk before you can crawl, right? Er, reverse that... Anyway, we got all hands on deck fer killin' the garbage being thrown at us by the Burning Legion. That leaves you with the honor of cleaning up the crazed wildlife of Shadowmoon Valley. Grab a sword, staff, whatever it is that makes you happy, and kill as much of the wildlife as you can see. That'll clear a way out for our supply caravans!How to Break Into the Arcatraz^70^All^Tempest Keep^A'dal^A'dal^Special Delivery to Shattrath City^^^A'dal has tasked you with the recovery of the Top and Bottom Shards of the Arcatraz Key. Return them to him, and he will fashion them into the Key to the Arcatraz for you.^A message was embedded in the ata'mal crystal that you recovered. Nexus-Prince Haramad has given us information vital to our campaign against Tempest Keep. He tells us that there are two pieces, shards to a key, which, when combined, will unlock the keep's Arcatraz satellite. One half is possessed by an ancient in the Botanica known as Warp Splinter. The other is held by Pathaleon the Calculator inside the Mechanar. Bring both shards to me and I will combine them into the Arcatraz key.Seer Udalo^70^All^Tempest Keep^Akama^Udalo^Seer Udalo^Akama^^Find Seer Udalo inside the Arcatraz in Tempest Keep.^I hope you're not shocked when I reveal to you that the pieces of the Medallion of Karabor you obtained from my minions are mere replicas. <Akama shows you an identical medallion in his open palm.> My Deathsworn and I have kept the secret from Illidan for as long as possible. We are however, still missing the final piece. Udalo came to me in dreams to announce he had found it. Unfortunately he is held by Kael'thas inside the Arcatraz in Tempest Keep. Find him and see what he knows.A Mysterious Portent^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Udalo^Akama^Seer Udalo^^^Return to Akama at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley.^Before he died, Udalo appears to have written a single word on the floor beneath him. The writing is barely legible but you recognize the word Atam'al. Perhaps Akama will understand the meaning of his brethren's message.The Ata'mal Terrace^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Akama^Akama^Seer Udalo^^Akama's Promise^Go to the top of the Ata'mal Terrace in Shadowmoon Valley and obtain the Heart of Fury. Return to Akama at the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley when you've completed this task.^It has been known to us that the fel orcs, under Illidan's command, have guarded an Ata'mal crystal known as the Heart of Fury at the Ata'mal Terrace. They cloud its presence with dark magic, to keep it from the Sha'tar. Fight your way to the Ata'mal Terrace outside the Black Temple and turn your eyes to the sky. Shadowlord Deathwail will circle the terrace, beyond your reach. You will have to slay him and his warlocks before you can obtain the crystal. It won't be easy, <name>. I wish you luck.Akama's Promise^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Akama^A'dal^^The Ata'mal Terrace^The Secret Compromised^Bring the Medallion of Karabor to A'dal in Shattrath City.^<Akama inserts the crystal into the medallion in his hand.> I am not as strong as I once was, <name>. Being so close to evil itself all these years - I do not know if I can trust myself with an artifact as powerful as this. Take this as my promise to you that when the time comes and you face Illidan, I will be on your side. Take it to the one being we know we can trust with its power. Take the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City.Reunion^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Leoroxx^Rexxar^The Spirits Have Voices^^^Speak with Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^So you come from the world beyond the Portal? And you know of Rexxar. Oh yes, I am quite familiar with him. You see, he is my son. But he made his choice a lifetime ago. He is not one of us, and he is not welcome here. We have enough troubles with the Bloodmaul ogres. Know this: being born a half-breed does not make you Mok'Nathal.Test Flight: The Singing Ridge^64^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tally Zapnabber^Tally Zapnabber^Test Flight: The Zephyrium Capacitorium^Picking Up Some Power Converters^Test Flight: Razaan's Landing^Sign Tally's Waiver, then speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium.^I've been fiddling with the Zephyrium Capicitorium and I'm ready to perform another test! Do you want to help? This next flight should be short, but fast! Um... and although I'm sure there's no danger... I have this, uh, waiver that I'd like you to sign. It's just a formality, I assure you! Best of luck! Talk to Rally to launch yourself, and come back to me after the experiment is over!Test Flight: Razaan's Landing^64^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tally Zapnabber^Tally Zapnabber^^Test Flight: The Singing Ridge^Test Flight: Ruuan Weald^Speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium.^<name>, I raised the efficiency of the Zephyrium Capacitorium by 30 percent. That will launch a test subject of your weight and wind drag ratio to new heights! Want to test my theory? This experiment ought to send you near Razaan's Landing. Speak with Rally... he'll get you prepared for launch.Test Flight: Ruuan Weald^64^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tally Zapnabber^O'Mally Zapnabber^^Test Flight: Razaan's Landing^^Speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. While flying to Ruuan Weald, spin the Nether-weather Vane. Deliver the Spinning Nether-weather Vane to O'Mally Zapnabber in Evergrove.^Hey, <name>. I'm glad I caught you! I have a very important mission! Here is a nether-weather vane. I need you to take some in flight readings for me and deliver them to my cousin in Ruuan Weald. Speak with Rally and take a Zephyrium Capacitorium flight to Ruuan Weald. While you're flying, spin the vane! After you land, bring the spinning vane to O'Mally Zabnabber. Good luck, <name>. And don't delay!...and a Time for Action^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tree Warden Chawn^Tree Warden Chawn^A Time for Negotiation...^^^Slay 10 Wyrmcult Hewers.^We will not stand idly by while they decimate the Ruuan Weald around us. Our first priority must be to the trees. <class>, I want you to go back out into the Weald and deliver a very different message for us. I want you to slay every one of their hewers that you come into contact with! If they will not listen to reason, perhaps they will listen to a more assertive method of persuasion!On Spirit's Wings^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Rexxar^The Spirits Have Voices^^^Find a Bloodmaul Taskmaster and a Bloodmaul Soothsayer engaged in conversation, then use Rexxar's Whistle to summon Spirit to spy on them.^If the Mok'Nathal are tormented by the Bloodmaul ogres, then I will stop them and their followers. Ogres are simple creatures, and there is little profit they could gain from harassing the Mok'Nathal. There must be something more to this. <name>, take Spirit, my hawk, and spy upon the conversations of the Bloodmaul's leaders. He may go undetected where we cannot.Into the Churning Gulch^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Baron Sablemane^The Spirits Have Voices^^Baron Sablemane's Poison^Collet 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands.^So, your Rexxar would have me fashion a poison for him? I'll give him what he desires, but there will be a price. Even for friends, there must be a price. Free things destroy friendships. First, you must venture a short distance to the southwest to the Churning Gulch. Therein mill some of the most poisonous creatures in all of Outland, or anywhere. I speak of the crust bursters, and this poison will require gathering their glands for me.Test Flight: Raven's Wood^64^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tally Zapnabber^ ^^^^Speak with Rally Zapnabber to use the Zephyrium Capacitorium. Return to Tally Zapnabber at Toshley's Station.^The Zephyrium Capacitorium is ready for its longest launch yet! What do you say, <name>? Do you want to fly one more time? I've been boosting the proplusion system but, until I get all the variables hammered out, the capicitorium will need added fuel to give it the necessary kick! Speak with Rally before the flight -- he has the details. Best of luck, <name>. This flight will take you to distant Raven's Wood. If you survive the flight -- and the wood's ogres and arakkoa -- come back and we'll celebrate!Poaching from Poachers^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Samia Inkling^Samia Inkling^Poaching from Poachers^A Time for Negotiation...^^Collect 5 Wyrmcult Nets.^Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Chawn. I'd like to help. I'm studying the Blackwing Coven, and helping the druids in their dealings with them. I am very interested in acquiring a few of their dragon whelps; it would help us to gauge exactly what we're up against by understanding that which they revere. But first, we're going to need to acquire some nets. I noticed that the wyrmcult poachers out in the Ruuan Weald have an abundance of them.The Spirits Have Voices^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Garm Wolfbrother^Rexxar^The Spirits Have Voices^The Thunderspike^^Speak with Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^<name>, now that you can see me, there is something you must tell Rexxar. I know that he seeks his people, and I know where they are. The Mok'Nathal, as they are known, have a village to the east beyond the Razor Ridge. Go, give Rexxar this news. His people are in danger, and I know that he will want to come to their aid.Did You Get The Note?^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Meeting Note^Tree Warden Chawn^^^Wyrmskull Watcher^Deliver the Meeting Note to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^The cultist dropped this note, which apparently was to be delivered to Overseer Nuaar. It is signed by someone named Kolphis Darkscale. It is likely that Tree Warden Chawn will be interested in looking at this.The Smallest Creatures^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane's Poison^^^Use the Kodohide Drum at the Marmot Den. While controlling the Marmot, poison the three kegs in the Bloodmaul Camp.^The ogres, simple as they are, would notice you dispersing this poison throughout their camp. Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task. By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands. There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood. Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs.A Boaring Time for Grulloc^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane^Baron Sablemane's Poison^^^Collect Grulloc's Sack.^<name>, I have a pet boar named Huffer. He wants to help you to have some fun with one of the nearby sons of Gruul. Grulloc inhabits a place known as the Cursed Hollow. When you get there, let Huffer loose. The gronn will have a fine time chasing him around, and you will retrieve the bag that he guards and deliver it to Baron Sablemane. To get to the Cursed Hollow, head down the northern ramp and east through Dragons' End. The hollow is on the eastern edge.Meeting at the Blackwing Coven^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Watcher Moonshade^Tree Warden Chawn^Wyrmskull Watcher^^^Collect enough Costume Scraps from wyrmcultists to create an Overseer Disguise. Use the disguise to attend the meeting with Kolphis Darkscale.^I know what must be done! <name>, you must pose as Overseer Nuaar and attend that meeting! The wyrmcultists at the coven all have a standard outfit that they wear, so go collect scraps from them, and when you have enough, put together a disguise. Pose as Overseer Nuuar and speak with Kolphis Darkscale to see what he has to say, and then return to Tree Warden Chawn. You'll find the coven by heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel and following the path past the Raven's Wood and Grishnath to its end.Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater^68^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane's Poison^^^Collect 3 Grisly Totems from the Boulder'mok ogres. Then, use Sablemane's Trap at Gorgrom's Altar to set the trap and summon and kill Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater.^The gronn we seek is Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater. With Sablemane's trap, you will make short work of the gronn. You will find him accepting sacrifices from the ogres of Boulder'mok. Follow the road north from the Circle of Blood, then west at Ruuan Weald. Go northwest through the tunnel. First, kill the ogres for their heads. We will send a message. Set the trap at his altar. When he is dead, plant the grisly totems near him - none can mistake that message. Take the bear. <Misha growls.>Prisoner of the Bladespire^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane's Poison^^^Slay Bladespire ogres to get the Wyvern Cage Key. Once you have it, go to the Wyvern Cage and use Spirit's Whistle to summon Spirit, who will unlock the cage to free Leokk.^Shortly after my arrival in the mountains, I came under attack by a group of Bladespire ogres. Though I fought free of them, and slew many, they took my wyvern, Leokk, captive. Spirit has found him, locked in a cage in the heart of the Bladespire encampment outside of Gruul's lair. One of the ogres must carry his key. Find it and Spirit can use it to unlock Leokk's cage. You will find the encampment at the north end of the Daggermaw Canyon down below.Eminence Among the Violet Eye^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Archmage Leryda^Archmage Leryda^Down the Violet Path^^Archmage No More^Bring your Violet Signet to Archmage Leryda at Deadwind Pass after obtaining Exalted reputation with the Violet Eye.^Your services have gone above and beyond what is expected of you, <name>.

We will bring Goc forth from his lair, and we will destroy him. With Goc dead, the Bladespire ogres will threaten the Mok'Nathal no longer. Go to Goc's altar outside Gruul's Lair, then blow my horn. I will come, and we will face the son of Gruul together.News of Victory^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Plexi^Kurdran Wildhammer^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Return to Wildhammer Stronghold and speak with Kurdran Wildhammer.^You must bring word of our success to Kurdran Wildhammer immediately! His men, under Wing Commander Nuainn, have fought nonstop to keep Wildhammer Stronghold safe and your return will surely bolster their spirits. With the threat from the Legion out of the way, Kurdran can finally turn his attention to dealing with the forces of Illidan. Our place here is far from secure, but we've won a major victory this day.News of Victory^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Nakansi^Overlord Or'barokh^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Return to Shadowmoon Village and speak with Overlord Or'barokh.^You must bring word of our success to Overlord Or'barokh immediately! Now that we've crushed the Legion and obliterated their presence in Shadowmoon Valley, the overlord can turn his attention to our other foes. Although the Kor'kron guard will never admit it, they'll be glad we're no longer fighting on two fronts.Whelps of the Wyrmcult^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Samia Inkling^Samia Inkling^Poaching from Poachers^^^Use the Blackwhelp Net to capture 10 Wyrmcult Blackwhelps.^I need to examine the whelps that they are raising at the Blackwing Coven. There should be an abundance of them flying around inside their cavernous base, as well as a number of eggs, which if you get close to them will likely hatch. Please, <name>, take the net and capture a handful of them alive for me. Find them by heading west across the Wyrmskull Bridge and heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel. Follow the path to its end past Grishnath and the Raven's Wood.Maxnar Must Die!^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tree Warden Chawn^Tree Warden Chawn^Wyrmskull Watcher^^^Slay Maxnar the Ashmaw.^They've left us no choice, <name>. It's time to put an end to the threat from the Blackwing Coven by taking out their leader, Maxnar the Ashmaw. I don't know if you caught a glimpse of him while you were in there, but he's one of the dragonkin, half-man, half-dragon. And he's tough, so don't underestimate him! Finish it quickly and with any luck you'll secure the safety of Evergrove and the Ruuan Weald.Baron Sablemane's Poison^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane's Poison^Into the Churning Gulch^Crush the Bloodmaul Camp^Deliver Baron Sablemane's Poison to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Here, take this to your master. I'm sure that whatever the reason, Rexxar will put it to good use. Oh, and do be certain to remind him that he owes me. He knows what I want, and I'm certain that however he intends to obtain it for me, I'll be seeing you again sooner than you think. Now, do be a good little <boy /girl> and run this up to Rexxar.The Path of Conquest^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Or'barokh^Kor'kron Wind Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Travel to the Path of Conquest in Shadowmoon Valley.^Word has come from my wind riders, <name>. The Eclipsion blood elves are planning something big. They have begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, far to the southeast - adjacent to Eclipse Point. I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you have done so, use this flare gun to signal a wind rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Inform them of what you have discovered and they will give you your next set of orders.Breaching the Path^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Kor'kron Wind Rider^Kor'kron Wind Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Slay 20 Eclipsion Soldiers, 10 Eclipsion Cavaliers, and 10 Eclipsion Spellbinders.^We're going to need more time, <race>. I'm going to fly further ahead with some of the other wind riders. Hopefully, we can gather some more information. What I need from you now is to clear a path and more importantly, keep their arrows pointed away from us! Call for a wind rider with the Kor'kron flare gun once you have thinned their numbers.Onward to Ashenvale^20^Alliance^Ashenvale^Thundris Windweaver^Raene Wolfrunner^^^^Speak with Raene Wolfrunner in Astranaar.^Recently Raene Wolfrunner came through Auberdine from Darnassus and was heading to Ashenvale; she said something about the Furbolgs. I wasn't given an opportunity to ask more about her situation but perhaps you can seek her out and lend her your aid <class>. Take the southern road out of Auberdine. Once you reach Ashenvale border continue your path down the road. There you will find Astranaar and Raene Wolfrunner.Culling the Wild^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Faradrella^Faradrella^^^^Slay 4 Felsworn Scalewing, 4 Felsworn Daggermaw, and 2 Fel Corrupters.^The number of atrocities committed by the Burning Legion is countless. Even as we speak, they send their legion forces against the creatures of this land. Helpless to defend against their power, they fall one by one. <name>, help me stop these crimes of nature destroy all which they corrupt. Over the hill, east of here, you will see the corruption spreading across Bladed Gulch. Kill the ones causing the crime, the Fel Corrupters, and as many Felsworn as you can.Entry Into the Citadel^70^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Primed Key Mold^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Bring the Primed Key Mold to Force Commander Danath at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^This freshly cast mold was to be used to create a key of some sort. From the image engraved on its back, it appears to be related to Hellfire Citadel. Maybe this could prove to interest to Danath, the force commander at Honor Hold.Entry Into the Citadel^70^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Primed Key Mold^Nazgrel^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Bring the Primed Key Mold to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^This freshly cast mold was to be used to create a key of some sort. From the image engraved on its back, it appears to be related to Hellfire Citadel. Maybe this could prove to interest to Nazgrel, the leader of the Horde's forces in Thrallmar.Grand Master Rohok^70^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Rohok^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Bring the Primed Key Mold to Rohok at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^The symbol on the key's handle... it is hard to make it out inside the mold, but I recognize it as the Shattered Hand's own. There is a good chance this key will allow you to enter the Shattered Halls. Speak to Rohok, our resident blacksmith. If anyone can forge this key it is he.Rohok's Request^70^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Rohok^Rohok^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Bring 4 Fel Iron Bars, 2 Arcane Dust and 4 Motes of Fire to Rohok at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^Fel orc blacksmiths may not be the most skilled in the world, but there is some craftsmanship to their trade. Only fel iron can be used with this mold if we want to end up with a working key - anything else would probably end up breaking it. Bring me some fel iron bars, a bit of arcane dust and motes of fire. I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises.Hotter than Hell^70^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Rohok^Rohok^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Destroy a Fel Reaver in Hellfire Peninsula and plunge the Unfired Key Mold into its remains. Bring the Charred Key Mold to Rohok in Thrallmar.^It's no good, <name>! No matter how many coals I put to the fire, it's just not enough heat. There's only one thing I can think of that is hot enough to temper this key and it is the insides of the Legion's fel reavers. I've only ever seen one downed once. I remember seeing its insides fuming, shooting fire and steam as it fell. Take this mold and plunge it into a fallen fel reaver. I recommend you get yourself some friends if you plan to take one down.Find the Deserter^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Gryphonrider Kieran^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^Asghar's Totem^Locate Parshah in the Magma Fields and speak to him.^I get the feeling that all the pieces are here, but I just can't put them together in a way that makes sense. I think our best lead is to attempt to locate this deserter. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning. Start your search for him along the road in Magma Fields to the northwest. It seems a likely place for him to take refuge.The Sketh'lon Wreckage^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Sergeant Kargrul^Sergeant Kargrul^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Recover the Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 1, Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 2, and Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 3 from the Dark Conclave arakkoa at the Sketh'lon Wreckage to Sergeant Kargrul at Shadowmoon Village.^The Sketh'lon Wreckage, just to the east, is an eerie place. The peons are convinced that it's cursed. There are few trees here, so the peons have no choice but to venture into the arakkoa ruins to chop wood. The arakkoa spirits prey on the work groups, draining their life and using it to fuel their foul magics. We must find out what is driving the dark conclave and stop them before their influence expands. Search the Sketh'lon Wreckage for evidence of their plans.Find the Deserter^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Sergeant Kargrul^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^Asghar's Totem^Locate Parshah in the Magma Fields and speak to him.^There's nothing here that would explain why the spirits of these arakkoa have remained in this world or how they came into thirst for the blood of orcs. I think our best lead is to try to find the deserter mentioned in the journal. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning. Start your search for him on the road through the Magma Fields to the southeast.Grand Master Dumphry^70^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Dumphry^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Bring the Primed Key Mold to Dumphry in Honor Hold.^The symbol on the key's handle... it is hard to make it out inside the mold, but I recognize it at the Shattered Hand's own. There is a good chance this key will allow you to enter the Shattered Halls. Speak to Dumphry. He is a master of his craft. If he can't craft this key for you, no one can.Dumphry's Request^70^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Dumphry^Dumphry^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Bring 4 Fel Iron Bars, 2 Arcane Dust and 4 Motes of Fire to Dumphry at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^Fel orcs might be complete barbarians but their smithing is not as primitive as you might think. Only fel iron can be used with this mold if we want to end up with a working key - anything else would probably end up breaking it. Bring me some fel iron bars, a bit of arcane dust and motes of fire. I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises.Hotter than Hell^70^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Dumphry^Dumphry^Entry Into the Citadel^^^Destroy a Fel Reaver in Hellfire Peninsula and plunge the Unfired Key Mold into its remains. Bring the Charred Key Mold to Dumphry in Honor Hold.^It's not working, <lad /lass>. I cannot give it enough heat... the materials will not be properly tempered. You know, the Fel Reavers used by the Burning Legion are powered by a scalding core of fel fire - it burns much hotter than normal fire. If you could find enough people to take one down, you could heat the mold in the insides of the fallen reaver. Beware, <class>, those fel reavers pack quite a punch.When Worlds Collide...^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Kor'kron Wind Rider^Kor'kron Wind Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Slay Chancellor Bloodleaf and Corok the Mighty and recover Illidan's Command.^At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor. You've probably already noticed the smaller giants on the path as well. Something is just not right about all of this, grunt. I want you to fight your way to this meeting and break up the party. Recover whatever you can from the scene and then call for one of us with the flare gun.Invasion Point: Cataclysm^69^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Nuainn^Plexi^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Report to Plexi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.^Now that we have access to the Legion's base at Invasion Point: Cataclysm, we need to figure out a way to shut down their operations there. Wildhammer Stronghold won't be safe until the Legion's presence is erased from Shadowmoon Valley. I've sent an advance party up to the invasion point to help you formulate a plan to destroy the Legion's supplies. Go back to Legion Hold and step into the teleporter with the green crystals above it. Plexi will meet you at your destination.Invasion Point: Cataclysm^69^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Blood Guard Gulmok^Nakansi^Bring Down the Warbringer!^^^Report to Nakansi at Invasion Point: Cataclysm.^Now that we have access to the Legion's base at Invasion Point: Cataclysm, we need to figure out a way to shut down their operations there. Shadowmoon Village won't be safe until the Legion's presence is erased from the valley. I've sent an advance party up to the invasion point to help you formulate a plan to destroy the Legion's supplies. Go back to Legion Hold and step into the teleporter with the green crystals above it. Nakansi will meet you at your destination.Tabards of the Illidari^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Kor'kron Wind Rider^Kor'kron Wind Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Collect 10 Illidari Tabards.^The wind riders must return to Shadowmoon Village to prepare for the next phase of our assault. What I need from you now are the tabards that these blood elves wear. When you have collected enough tabards, call for a wind rider using the Kor'kron flare gun. Prepare yourself for a bit of espionage, <race>!Dissension Amongst the Ranks...^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Kor'kron Wind Rider^Overlord Or'barokh^The Path of Conquest^^^Slay 5 Crazed Colossus while in disguise as an Illidari blood elf and return to Overlord Or'barokh at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley. He will also want his Kor'kron Flare Gun returned.^Researcher Tiorus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth. Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties!Little Embers^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mosswood the Ancient^Mosswood the Ancient^^^^Mosswood the Ancient wants you to kill 8 Scorch Imps and then return to him in Ruuan Weald.^Northeast of here, on the plateau above us lies the burnt ashes of my ancient home. A great wood flourished there before the Burning Legion sent their imps to burn us away. So many died that even centuries later my tired old heart hungers for revenge. There are too many of them for us to ever reclaim the land, but you could make them afraid. Surely you will help me?From the Ashes^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mosswood the Ancient^Mosswood the Ancient^^^^Mosswood the Ancient wants you to journey to Skald and plant Ironroot Seeds in three different mounds of Fertile Volcanic Soil and then return to him in Ruuan Weald.^If you follow the road east and up the side of the mountain, then turn north, you will come to my long lost home. Once there was a wood there. Its name is forgotten. Long ago the Burning Legion summoned scorched imps and other creatures of flame. My home was destroyed and my people fled. Now only I remain. I have saved some ironroot seeds that could be planted in fertile volcanic soil. Their magic is strong. Do this for me and I will share with you the treasures of a forgotten age.The Path of Conquest^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Thane Yoregar^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Travel to the Path of Conquest in Shadowmoon Valley.^My gryphon riders have come back with a bit of news! The Eclipsion blood elves are planning something big. They've begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, located east of here - adjacent to Eclipse Point. I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you've done so, use this flare gun to signal a gryphon rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Tell 'em what you've discovered and they'll give you the next set of orders.Breaching the Path^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Slay 20 Eclipsion Soldiers, 10 Eclipsion Cavaliers, and 5 Sons of Corok.^We're going to need more time, <race>. I'm going to fly further ahead with some of the other gryphon riders. Hopefully, we can gather some more information. What I need from you now is to clear a path and more importantly, keep their arrows pointed away from us! Call for a gryphon rider with the Wildhammer flare gun once you have thinned their numbers.Blood Elf + Giant = ???^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Slay Chancellor Bloodleaf and Corok the Mighty and recover Illidan's Command.^At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor. What are giants even doing here? Something is just not right about all of this, grunt. I want you to fight your way to this meeting and break up the party. Recover whatever you can from the scene and then call for one of us with the flare gun.Tabards of the Illidari^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^The Path of Conquest^^^Collect 10 Illidari Tabards.^The gryphon riders must return to Wildhammer Stronghold to prepare for the next phase of our assault. What I need from you now are the tabards that these blood elves wear. When you have collected enough tabards, call for a gryphon rider using the Wildhammer flare gun. Prepare yourself for a bit of espionage, <race>!Dissension Amongst the Ranks...^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Wildhammer Gryphon Rider^Thane Yoregar^The Path of Conquest^^^Slay 5 Crazed Colossus while in disguise as an agent of Illidan and return to Thane Yoregar at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley. He will also want his Wildhammer Flare Gun returned.^Gnomus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth. Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties!Asghar's Totem^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Parshah^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Bring the Sketh'lon War Totem to Parshah in the Magma Fields.^What you read in the commander's journal is true. While the orcish Horde massed under Gul'dan, my people sought to defend ourselves from the threat by striking against him. Gul'dan learned of their intentions and cast a mighty spell that destroyed our camps and twisted the spirits of my brothers. They must be stopped before they unleash a greater evil. In the Sketh'lon Wreckage to the north, seek out Asghar and bring me the totem he carries. With it, we can begin to thwart the dark conclave's plans.The Rod of Lianthe^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Parshah^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Obtain Lianthe's Key from any of the blood elves at Eclipse Point and use it to open Lianthe's Strongbox and claim the Rod of Lianthe. Return the rod to Parshah in the Magma Fields.^The totem alone is not strong enough to counteract the sinister magics of the dark conclave. We can combine it with other objects of power, forming a staff to focus the energies. We cannot rescue my brethren from the depths of their depravity, but we can stop them. One of the items I need for the staff is the Rod of Lianthe, held by the blood elves at Eclipse Point to the southeast. It is kept in a pavilion on the top tier of the ruins and will be heavily guarded. Use caution, <name>.Sketh'lon Feathers^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Parshah^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Gather 8 Sketh'lon Feathers and bring them to Parshah in the Magma Fields.^There is one last element missing from the staff. We must direct the staff's power toward the Dark Conclave spirits. We can do that by gathering feathers scattered on the ground at the Sketh'lon Base Camp and using them in the staff. The base camp is to the south, east of Wildhammer Stronghold. Gul'dan's magic utterly destroyed my brethren, leaving only their spirits, but it did not stop there. The magic fed on the spell the arakkoa were preparing, forging a sinister force that engulfed the spirits.Battle of the Crimson Watch^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Crystal Prison^A'dal^The Journal of Val'zareq: Portends of Wa^^^Battle the forces of Illidan at Crimson Watch and survive!^They are probably searching for you on the Path of Conquest as we speak. You must make your escape, <race>! Leave me, I'm done for... They... I think I hear them coming. It's now or never! Get out! If you choose to stay, you will have to fight! If you fight and somehow manage to survive, take what you have learned here and deliver that knowledge to A'dal in Shattrath City.Imbuing the Headpiece^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Parshah^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Equip the Unfinished Headpiece, travel to the Altar of Damnation, and use it while standing near Gul'dan. When the headpiece is energized, return to Parshah in the Magma Fields.^The staff is nearly finished! All that remains is to imbue the headpiece with power flowing from the echoes of Gul'dan in this accursed place. To the east, near the Fel Pits and south of the Deathforge, is the Altar of Damnation. There, fragments of Gul'dan's past are trapped. When you carry the unfinished headpiece of the staff into the area around the altar, don't be surprised if some of the entities react to it. You will be carrying a dangerous object with strong connections to the cataclysm.Baron Sablemane^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane^The Spirits Have Voices^^^Speak with Baron Sablemane at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Here is my plan. We will poison the ogres and then destroy their gronn master. During my travels in these mountains, I met a man named Baron Sablemane. He is a master of the alchemical arts, and may be convinced to assist us. You will find him at the Circle of Blood, down in the canyon to the north of here. Whatever price he requires, I will leave it to your discretion to accept.Crush the Bloodmaul Camp^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^^Baron Sablemane's Poison^^Slay 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks.^<Tor'chunk leans in close to whisper.> <name>, you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres so far. And while I have every confidence in what Rexxar has planned, I would still ask that you crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp before returning. That way we'll be doubly certain of the outcome. To get there, head north down the ramp out of Thunderlord. Then, at the base of the ramp, head west across Dragons' End and north through the Churning Gulch and Daggermaw Canyon.It's a Trap!^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Rexxar^Baron Sablemane's Poison^^Slaughter at Boulder'mok^Deliver the Dragonfire Trap to Rexxar at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^There's is no cause of fury greater in this world than that of Gruul and his sons. They slaughtered my people - my children - and now I will have revenge. I have fashioned a trap from dragon fire, and if you're clever enough, you can use it to kill even a gronn. Just hurry, take the trap to Rexxar. My thirst for revenge must be quenched.Slaughter at Boulder'mok^68^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^^It's a Trap!^^Slay 5 Boulder'mok Brutes and 3 Boulder'mok Shaman, and then return to Tor'chunk Twoclaws at Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^I know that Rexxar has plans for you to head to Boulder'mok. I have something that I want you to do while you are there. We must take any chance we can get to strike down the ogres of these mountains, or they will overrun us, and all that we have bled and died for will be for nothing! Boulder'mok lies far to the northwest. Travel north to Ruuan Weald, and from there head west through the tunnel and past the Raven's Wood. <name>, I want you to kill the Bladespire ogres of Boulder'mok. Wipe them out!Return to Talionia^10^Blood Elf^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Talionia^Return to Talionia^^^Speak with Talionia in Silvermoon City.^One of your masters, Talionia, in Silvermoon City has sent a summons for you, <name>. I'm certain it is time you learned to summon and control a more powerful demon, so I suggest you see her at once. I understand Talionia is found in The Sanctum, a cozy little den of evil found along Murder Row.Return to Carendin Halgar^10^Undead^Warlock^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Carendin Halgar^Return to Carendin Halgar^^^Speak with Carendin Halgar in Undercity.^Ah, so there you are, <name>. Carendin Halgar has sent out word for you to come see him in the Magic Quarter of Undercity. He is not known for his patience, so I would not wait long.Return to Gan'rul Bloodeye^10^Orc^Warlock^Carendin Halgar^Gan'rul Bloodeye^Return to Gan'rul Bloodeye^^^Speak with Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.^You are a long way from home, <race>. Perhaps it is time you returned to learn from your master, Gan'rul Bloodeye. His knowledge is known to all of our craft, even those of us here. Gan'rul dwells in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar.Welcoming the Wolf Spirit^64^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Malukaz^Malukaz^Vestments of the Wolf Spirit^^^Use the Ceremonial Incense near the candles in Malukaz's hut and observe the ceremony. When the ceremony is complete, speak with Malukaz again.^I've nearly completed the vestments that I'll wear during the ceremony. As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left. I believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the wolf spirit after a successful hunt. Once you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony.Zeth'Gor Must Burn!^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Captain Darkhowl^Captain Darkhowl^^Wanted: Worg Master Kruush^^Kill Bleeding Hollow Peons for their torches, ignite them at Zeth'Gor's forge then throw the burning torches at Zeth'Gor Buildings.^The Bleeding Hollow clan have betrayed their noble heritage! We, the orcs who fought and died to save ourselves from the fel taint of Mannoroth, look upon our vile cousins and see only weakness and ignobility... and for that, they must burn! Enter Zeth'Gor, their bastion to the east, and burn their buildings. Kill peons for their torches, ignite them at their forge, and hurl the burning torches at their hovels, their stable and their barracks. Burn them all, and then return to me! For the Horde!The Journal of Val'zareq: Portends of War^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^The Journal of Val'zareq^Crystal Prison^The Journal of Val'zareq: Portends of War^^^Locate Marcus Auralion, High General of the Sha'tar, at Crimson Watch.^This journal documents the recent activities of Illidan's armies. It also explains why Val'zareq was parading around the Path of Conquest. He was personally responsible for the capture of a high general of the Sha'tar. This general is being held at a post known as Crimson Watch, located at the southern end of the Path of Conquest. A mysterious faction, calling itself the Crimson Sigil, is charged with his incarceration. If you choose to investigate, it would be wise to bring allies.Rogues of the Shattered Hand^24^Horde^Rogue^Zelanis^Shenthul^Rogues of the Shattered Hand^^^Speak with Shenthul in Orgrimmar.^<name>, there are secrets in the world that we do not yet possess. The Shattered Hand in Orgrimmar can lead you to one of these secrets: the method for brewing deadly poisons. Do as they ask and you will gain their trust. To reach Orgrimmar, take the portal in Silvermoon City to Undercity. Then, travel outside the city and find the nearby tower where the goblin Zepplins pick up their passengers. From there, fly to the city of Orgrimmar where you can find Shenthul in the Cleft of Shadow.A Date with Dorgok^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Commander Haephus Stonewall^^^Favor of the Gronn^Slay Dorgok at Bloodmaul Camp.^Good, I've seen you around and I've been meaning to speak to you about a matter of some importance. There are reports coming in that for some reason the Bloodmaul ogres are planning an offensive against Sylvanaar and Ruuan Weald. We don't know who or what is pushing them to do this, but I intend to nip their plan in the bud! Bloodmaul Camp is where the attacks are to be staged from. Head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald and you will find it. I want you to kill their leader, Dorgok!Crush the Bloodmaul Camp!^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Lieutenant Fairweather^Lieutenant Fairweather^^^^Slay 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks.^I've heard that you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres thus far. Now, I would ask that you face them again. I want you to crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp! To get down there, head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald. You'll find them at the base of the ramp. Good luck, <class>!Favor of the Gronn^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Gorgrom's Favor^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Favor of the Gronn^A Date with Dorgok^^Deliver Gorgrom's Favor to Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^A token in the form of a small statuette falls from Dorgok's dead clutch. It bears a striking resemblance to one of the gronn. Surely, Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Ruuan Weald, up the ramp to the east, would be interested in this!Pay the Baron a Visit^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Baron Sablemane^Favor of the Gronn^^^Speak with Baron Sablemane at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^This is bad news. Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater is behind the recent Bloodmaul plans against Sylvanaar! Why he's manipulating them, and not just using the Bladespire, I don't know. But if we're to deal with a gronn, we're going to need help. I know a man who is wise in the ways of all sorts of exotic magics. Baron Sablemane is his name, and you can find him at the Circle of Blood, back down the ramp to the northwest, and then southwest through the canyon. Ask him to fashion us a trap for the gronn.Into the Churning Gulch^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Baron Sablemane^Favor of the Gronn^^^Collect 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands.^Very well, I'll create this trap, but first I want something in return. There happens to be a nearby gronn that is in possession of an item that I want, but you can't face him, not yet anyway. So, you and I are going to fashion a sleeping powder from the poison of the nearby crust bursters. You'll find them in the Churning Gulch to the southwest. Bring me a number of their glands, and be quick about it!Goodnight, Gronn^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Baron Sablemane^Favor of the Gronn^^^Collect Grulloc's Sack.^I've outdone myself again. I've fashioned a sleeping powder for you to use on Grulloc, the gronn I spoke of who is guarding what I want. Grulloc keeps himself at the Cursed Hollow, an area at the eastern edge of Dragons' End on the other side of the Circle of Blood. If I were you, I wouldn't tarry long once you have his sack. The effects of the dust won't last long.It's a Trap!^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Favor of the Gronn^^Slaughter at Boulder'mok^Deliver the Dragonfire Trap to Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^There's nothing more that I hate in this world than the sons of Gruul and their father! They slaughtered my people, and my children, and now I will have a taste of revenge! I have fashioned a trap from some dragon fire, and if you're clever enough, you might just be able to use it to kill a gronn. I'm sure that you have a particular gronn in mind; it matters not to me which one you kill. Just hurry, take the trap to your Commander Stonewall. My thirst for revenge must be quenched!Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater^68^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Favor of the Gronn^^^Collect 3 Grisly Totems from Boulder'mok ogres. Then, use Sablemane's Trap at Gorgrom's Altar to summon and kill Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater.^We must show the ogres that we are not to be trifled with. We must send a message. Travel to Boulder'mok and kill the ogres there. Make sure you keep their heads. Then go to Gorgrom's altar and place the trap there for him. Gorgrom will appear, and you must lure him into the trap. When he is dead, mount your grisly totems near his corpse, so that the ogres may look at their fallen master and their fallen brothers, and know the price for seeking to destroy us.Slaughter at Boulder'mok^68^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Lieutenant Fairweather^Lieutenant Fairweather^^It's a Trap!^^Slaughter 5 Boulder'mok Brutes and 3 Boulder'mok Shaman.^I know that we have plans for you to head to Boulder'mok. I have something that I want you to do while you are there. We must take any chance we can get to strike down the ogres of these mountains, or they will overrun us, and all that we have bled and died for will be for nothing! Boulder'mok lies to the west. Travel southwest, cross the bridge and head through the tunnel. On the west side of the Raven's Wood you will find them. <name>, I want you to wipe out the Bladespire ogres of Boulder'mok.Kindness^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Mordenai^Mordenai^Kindness^^^Mordenai at Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to feed 8 Mature Netherwing Drakes.^Something has them spooked, <race>. <Mordenai points to the nether drakes flying overhead.> They won't even come down to feed. I have seen several fall to the earth, dead from exhaustion before their bodies hit the ground. We must save them! The Rocknail flayers that are found near the crystals are their natural prey. Kill flayers and take their carcasses. Place a carcass in the field and stand extremely still. As long as you do not make any aggressive motions, they will not attack you.Massacre at Gruul's Lair^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Baron Sablemane^Favor of the Gronn^^^Slay 10 Bladespire Enforcers, 5 Bladespire Battlemages, 5 Bladespire Ravagers and their leader, Fingrom.^You've proven yourself resourceful, and now I think I'm going to put you to personal use in my own fight against Gruul and his sons. The Bladespire clan are the favored of the gronn, and while you may have thinned out their numbers elsewhere, you haven't yet dealt with their strongest. Gruul protects the exterior of his lair with only the toughest of ogres, and it is those that you must kill. Head north through the Daggermaw Canyon and you will find Gruul's Lair at the end.Showdown^70^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Baron Sablemane^Baron Sablemane^Favor of the Gronn^^^Use Sablemane's Signet at the Altar of Goc, then kill Goc.^The time has come for us to face Goc, the master of the Bladespire ogres. It is also time that I take a hand in events, to see the last of the gronn's life. Take my signet ring. When you come to the Altar of Goc, use it, and I will come to join you. Together we will destroy Goc.The Ashtongue Broken^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Varen the Reclaimer^Varen the Reclaimer^The Ashtongue Broken^^Reclaiming Holy Grounds^Varen the Reclaimer wants you to go to the Ruins of Baa'ri and slay 3 Ashtongue Handlers, 4 Ashtongue Warriors and 6 Ashtongue Shaman.^The Ashtongue tribe is feared among all Broken. It consists of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by Akama himself. They are as fierce and ruthless as any naga, demon or blood elf in Illidan's army and they have been deployed in large numbers at the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the north. Go there and put a dent in their numbers before they get a chance to mount an attack on us.Thwart the Dark Conclave^69^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Parshah^Parshah^The Sketh'lon Wreckage^^^Slay the Dark Conclave Ritualists and use the Staff of Parshah to end the Dark Conclave's summoning ritual, then return to Parshah in the Magma Fields.^The spirits of the dark conclave seek to summon an ancient and powerful evil through a ritual conducted at the lava pits to the south of the Sketh'lon Base Camp. Gul'dan's magic mingled with their own, empowering them to aid this creature in manifesting in our world! We must not allow this to happen, <name>. The death and destruction it would bring are unimaginable! Carry the staff with you to the site of the summoning and use its magics to stop the dark conclave once and for all!Wanted: Worg Master Kruush^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Wanted Poster^Captain Darkhowl^^^Zeth'Gor Must Burn!, The Eyes of Grillok^Kill Worg Master Kruush and bring his head to Captain Darkhowl in Spinebreaker Post.^The poster reads: "Worg Master Kruush leads the worg riders of the Bleeding Hollow clan. A price has been placed on his head, for his riders exact heavy tolls on supply trains to Spinebreaker Post." "Scouts report him within Zeth'Gor, and the hero able to bring the severed head of this villain to me will earn the thanks of the Horde, and a large bounty." "-Captain Darkhowl"Damaged Mask^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Damaged Mask^O'Mally Zapnabber^Damaged Mask^^^Deliver the Damaged Mask to O'Mally Zapnabber at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^As you examine the damaged mask, you hear strange sounds coming from within. If the mask wasn't damaged you might be able to hear the sounds more clearly. O'Mally Zapnabber in Ruuan Weald might be able to fix the mask.Seek Out Neltharaku^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Mordenai^Neltharaku^Kindness^^^Seek out Neltharaku, patron of the Netherwing Dragonflight.^Their patron soars high above, <name>. Perhaps the kindness that you showed his children has moved his heart. Seek Neltharaku out and enlist his aid. Together, you may be able to solve the plight of the Netherwing drakes. <Mordenai points to the sky.> Fly high, friend...Mystery Mask^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^O'Mally Zapnabber^Wildlord Antelarion^Damaged Mask^^^Deliver the Mystery Mask to Wildlord Antelarion at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Ok, it should work now. What is it, you ask? Why, it's a communication device - it allows those blockheads to communicate with each other. You know, the Burning Legion! I would suggest that you hand this mask to Wildlord Antelarion. He's over there pacing around. Always moving, he is. Well get moving, he's been trying to get his hands on one of these for sometime now.The Eyes of Grillok^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Zezzak^Zezzak^The Eyes of Grillok^Wanted: Worg Master Kruush^^Use Zezzak's Shard to capture an Eye of Grillok, then approach Zezzak's cauldron to extract it. After it is removed, return Zezzak's Shard to him.^<name>, you have braved the lair of the Bleeding Hollow orcs, dreaded Zeth'Gor, and survived! Perhaps you have the strength to aid me, for I aim to gaze into the mind of its darkest witch, Grillok! Take this shard. Use it to ensorcel an Eye of Grillok and bind it to yourself. Return here and approach my cauldron... and it will pull the eye from you. Go, <name>. And use care -- An Eye of Grillok will betray you to our enemies if given the slightest opening!Neltharaku's Tale^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Neltharaku^Neltharaku^Kindness^^^Speak with Neltharaku and listen to his story.^I have information that you may find useful. Please listen to what I have to tell you, <race>.Reclaiming Holy Grounds^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Vindicator Aluumen^Vindicator Aluumen^The Ashtongue Tribe^^^Vindicator Aluumen wants you to slay 8 Shadowmoon Slayers, 8 Shadowmoon Chosen and 4 Shadowmoon Darkweavers.^You did well against the Broken in Baa'ri, <name>. Let's see how well you do against Illidan's most feared army. The fel orcs of the Shadowmoon Clan occupy the Ata'mal Terrace, once a very holy site where ata'mal crystals were used in spiritual ceremonies. We had reason to believe they were hiding an actual ata'mal crystal in the vicinity, but our scrying has revealed nothing. Nevertheless, the fel orcs are on draenei holy ground and their presence must be dealt with.The Great Retribution^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Varen the Reclaimer^Varen the Reclaimer^The Ashtongue Broken^^^Varen the Reclaimer wants you to slay 8 Shadowmoon Slayers, 8 Shadowmoon Chosen and 4 Shadowmoon Darkweavers.^You did well against the Ashtongue Broken, <name>. I have another challenge for you, should you be up to it. Not too long ago, the Sanctum of the Stars suffered a tremendous attack by Illidan's fel orcs. We've determined it was perpetrated by the Shadowmoon orcs who occupy the Ata'mal Terrace. Show them that the Scryers are not to be trifled with.Baron Sablemane Has Requested Your Presence^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Haephus Stonewall^Baron Sablemane^Favor of the Gronn^^^Speak with Baron Sablemane at the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^<name>, while you were out being one hell of a <class>, Baron Sablemane sent his pet dragon up here with a message. He's asked for you personally. From what I understand, he wants you to head up his own fight against the gronn. I guess you're the most qualified person in all of Outland to help him, but if I were you, I'd get in contact with a couple of friends first and ask them to join you at the Circle of Blood.Felsworn Gas Mask^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Wildlord Antelarion^Legion Communicator^Damaged Mask^^^Wear the Felsworn Gas Mask and use the Legion Communicator at Forge Camp: Anger in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^I have a very special mission for you, <name>. I need you to infiltrate Forge Camp: Anger east of here. When you enter the camp you will need to wear the Felsworn gas mask and locate the Legion communicator. Once you have located the communication device speak with whomever is on the other side of the device. If all works out you can trick the demon into something devious! Try telling the demon that Camp Anger has revolted. Good luck to you <class>.Deceive thy Enemy^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Legion Communicator^Legion Communicator^Damaged Mask^^^Slay 4 Doomforge Attendants and 4 Doomforge Engineers.^For every moment I hear silence, you draw closer to your death! SPEAK! What? The camp has revolted? This cannot possibly be true! My minions would not dare undermine my authority. Well then, every last one of them will pay for this treachery, they will pay dearly. Silence them all and be done with it! Report back to me once you have carried out my order or you shall be dealt with.You're Fired!^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Legion Communicator^Wildlord Antelarion^Damaged Mask^^^Slay Doomcryer.^Doomcryer did nothing to stop the revolt? How dare she! She has been trying to undermine my authority for some time. However, this time will be her last. You must summon her and deal with her personally. Her anger guards hold the keys that summon her to Forge Camp: Anger. Retrieve the five keys and activate the five Legion obelisks. The obelisks have a short duration, so make sure they are all activated at the same time. Remember, the anger guards carry more keys.Sunfury Signets^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Battlemage Vyara^Battlemage Vyara^^^Single Sunfury Signet, More Sunfury Signets^Battlemage Vyara at the Sanctum of the Stars wants you to bring her 10 Sunfury Signets.^The survival of the Scryers hinges on outrecruiting Kael'thas. Every pilgrim from Quel'Thalas that joins his side brings him closer to victory. The opposite is true for us. Soon, however, we will run out of recruits and it will come down to what side can kill the other quicker. Prove your worth to the Scryers by bringing me Sunfury signets worn by high-ranking blood elves allied with Kael'thas and Illidan. You'll find them at Eclipse Point to the west and the Ruins of Karabor, to the northeast.The Truth Unorbed^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Orb of the Grishna^Tree Warden Chawn^^^Treebole Must Know^Deliver the Orb of the Grishna to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^This strange, magical orb drops from beneath the contour feathers of the arakkoa. Suffused with an eerie, purple glow, the orb pulses to an unheard beat. Holding it makes you mildly uncomfortable, and so you quickly place it within your pack. Perhaps Tree Warden Chawn at Ruuan Weald to the west, through the tunnel and across the Wyrmskull Bridge, would be interested in examining it?Marks of Sargeras^70^All^Shattrath City^Harbinger Saronen^Harbinger Saronen^^^More Marks of Sargeras, Single Mark of Sargeras^Bring 10 Marks of Sargeras to Harbinger Saronen in Shadowmoon Valley.^By now it should be clear to you why we oppose the Burning Legion and those who serve them. If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of high-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers. Here in Shadowmoon you will find a strong Legion presence to the far west in Legion Hold and the Deathforge.Treebole Must Know^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tree Warden Chawn^Treebole^Treebole Must Know^The Truth Unorbed^^Speak with Treebole, an ancient of lore who lives in the Raven's Wood of the Blade's Edge Mountains.^This is troubling! The arakkoa are causing the ancients and protectors to become possessed by evil spirits! But, there is one ancient that could not possibly have been affected. His name is Treebole, and you must go to him at once if we're to save the trees of the Raven's Wood! Go back to the Raven's Wood. You will find him at the fork in the path just past Grishnath.Exorcising the Trees^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Treebole^Treebole^Treebole Must Know^^^Collect 5 Grishnath Orbs and 5 Dire Pinfeathers and then combine them into Exorcism Feathers. Use these feathers to exorcise and slay 5 Koi-Koi Spirits from the Raven's Wood Leafbeards.^The Grishna have caused the leafbeards and stonebarks to be inhabited by evil koi-koi spirits. We must save the trees or soon all of the Raven's Wood will be lost forever! Combine the magic of a Grishnath orb, found throughout Grishnath, with a dire pinfeather from a dire raven. Use the resultant exorcism feather to draw out and slay the koi-koi spirit as quickly as possible. The stonebarks are too powerful for this ritual, but if enough leafbeards are saved, they will be freed as well.Becoming a Mooncloth Tailor^70^All^Tailoring^Nasmara Moonsong^Nasmara Moonsong^^^^Use the Square of Imbued Netherweave while standing in Cenarion Refuge's moonwell to create a Sample of Primal Mooncloth. Bring the completed sample back to Nasmara Moonsong in Shattrath's Lower City.^I can teach you the ways of mooncloth tailoring, if you are interested.. By specializing in mooncloth tailoring, creating primal mooncloth will yield twice the normal amount and you will have access to several exclusive patterns. All that is required is that you pass a simple test. As to the test, your task is to create a small sample of primal mooncloth in the moonwell at Cenarion Refuge. I will provide all the materials you'll need. When you've created the sample, bring it back to me for examination.Becoming a Spellfire Tailor^70^All^Tailoring^Gidge Spellweaver^Gidge Spellweaver^^^^Bring a sample of Nether-wraith Essence to Gidge Spellweaver in Shattrath's Lower City.^I can teach you the ways of spellfire tailoring if you wish, but be warned, it's a dangerous pursuit. Creating spellcloth in Netherstorm attracts powerful nether-wraiths. I'm searching for a way to lessen backlash, but I need more nether-wraith essence for my research. Take this beacon with you to Netherstorm and use it to summon a nether-wraith. Bring back its essence and I'll agree to teach you. As a spellfire tailor, you'll receive twice as much cloth and have access to exclusive patterns.Becoming a Shadoweave Tailor^70^All^Tailoring^Andrion Darkspinner^Andrion Darkspinner^^^^Use the Crystal of Deep Shadows near the Altar of Shadows to deepen your attunement to the altar, then return to Andrion Darkspinner in Shattrath's Lower City.^If you become a shadoweave specialist, you will make twice as much shadowcloth as an average tailor and have access to several exclusive patterns. Of course, any tailor can use the Altar of Shadows, but a shadoweave tailor possesses a deeper attunement to the altar, unlocking powers that few can fathom. Take this crystal to eastern Shadowmoon Valley, and find Netherwing Pass leading south from the Netherwing Fields. Near the world's edge, you will find the Altar of Shadows. Use the crystal there.Grillok "Darkeye"^62^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Zezzak^Zezzak^The Eyes of Grillok^^^Kill Grillok Darkeye and bring Grillok's Eyepatch to Zezzak in Spinebreaker Post.^Grillok Darkeye has wagered a piece of himself to dark powers, and gained great magic for it. His lost eye burns deep in some hellish pit, now a demon's trinket... and the patch that covers his betrayal holds its own dark secrets. Bring me Grillok's eyepatch, <name>, and I will reward you greatly for your service...Apothecary Antonivich^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Albreck^Apothecary Antonivich^Boiling Blood^^^Bring Albreck's Findings to Apothecary Antonivich at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^<name>, I have prepared a preliminary report of my findings regarding the Bleeding Hollow orcs. My colleague in Thrallmar, Apothecary Antonivich, will be happy to receive them. He too studies the phenomenon of fel orcs... in hopes of preventing such a tragedy from again befalling our orcish allies. Take him this report, and I will continue my study of the blood you brought me. If fortune is with us, we will isolate the cause of the fel orc affliction.Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Neltharaku^Neltharaku^Kindness^^^Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to slay 15 Dragonmaw Orcs.^I require time so that I may devise a plan to save my children and mate. You will buy me this time, mortal. Venture into Dragonmaw Fortress, located on the eastern edge of the Netherwing Fields, and lay waste to all Dragonmaw orcs that you find. The ensuing chaos and confusion should have a considerable impact on their plans. Be warned, some of my kin are too far gone - their minds corrupted by the Dragonmaw. For them, the only resolution is death. You have my permission to end their lives as well.To Netherwing Ledge!^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Neltharaku^Neltharaku^Kindness^^^Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to collect 12 Nethervine Crystals from Netherwing Ledge.^I believe that I can imbue nethervine crystals with my own essence. The power contained within these imbued crystals should be sufficient to free enslaved drakes of their masters' grasps. Travel to Netherwing Ledge, an island located off the broken shelf of Shadowmoon Valley, to the southeast. It is on Netherwing Ledge that you will find nethervine crystals. Return to me when you have collected enough crystals to fill your packs. And <name>, Beware the Dragonmaw that now inhabit the island.The Demoniac Scryer^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Antonivich^Apothecary Antonivich^Boiling Blood^^^Use the Demoniac Scryer in Hellfire Basin, wait for it to attune, and then take a reading.^The Demoniac Scryer is now ready. Take it behind Hellfire Citadel, to Hellfire Basin, and summon it upon the ground. It will then begin to attune itself to Hellfire Citadel. After its attunement, speak to the Scryer and transcribe what it tells you. Bring that transcription to me... Go, <name>, but only when you are ready. There is no doubt that Hellfire Citadel will detect the Scryer and send wardens to destroy it!Veil Skith: Darkstone of Terokk^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Kirrik the Awakened^Kirrik the Awakened^Surrender to the Horde^^^Use the Rod of Purification on the Darkstone of Terokk in Veil Skith and return to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes.^Veil Skith lies to the northwest of the caravan and to the south of Shattrath in a secluded grove of the forest. It is rumored that the colony of Skettis has constructed a maligned altar of worship. This Darkstone of Terokk must be purified if the arakkoa of Skith are ever to be redeemed. Take this Rod of Purification and cast it upon the Darkstone. Blessed by A'dal, the rod's purity might be enough to bring clarity to the Darkstone. Go now and may the light shine upon thee.The Tomb of Lights^65^All^Terokkar Forest^High Priest Orglum^High Priest Orglum^^Seek Out Kirrik^Recover the Bones^High Priest Orglum wants you to journey to the Tomb of Lights and kill 10 Ethereal Nethermancers and 10 Ethereal Plunderers and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan.^To the east, buried under the charred sand, is the Tomb of Lights, a lost resting place of the dead. Before our caravan was ambushed I was going to journey to the tomb and cleanse it of evil spirits. Little did I know it was already infested with another kind of evil. Even now the ethereals plunder the bodies of the fallen for trinkets and keepsakes that were given to the dead centuries ago. There is little I can do while our caravan struggles to survive.Vengeful Souls^65^All^Terokkar Forest^High Priest Orglum^High Priest Orglum^^Seek Out Kirrik^^High Priest Orglum wants you to journey into the Tomb of Lights and defeat 5 Vengeful Draenei.^The Tomb of Lights has become corrupted by the Shadow Council and the draenei dead have become cursed spirits, angry and confused with a burning hatred for the living. Enter the tomb and seek out these tragic victims. Give them the rest that they deserve.Since Time Forgotten...^68^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Leoroxx^Leoroxx^Understanding the Mok'Nathal^^^Slay Gnosh Brognat, leader of the ogres at the Bladespire Outpost.^Since time forgotten we have fought with the Bladespire ogres. We have managed to push them back so that now they only hold a tenuous grip at Bladespire Outpost. It's back the way that you came, on the southwestern edge of the Razor Ridge. Prove your worth to me by killing their leader, Gnosh Brognat. Let us see what stuff you are made of when fighting the ogres.Slay the Brood Mother^68^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Leoroxx^Leoroxx^Understanding the Mok'Nathal^^^Slay Dreadwing.^My hunters have just returned from a scouting mission to the Singing Ridge. It seems that the nether drakes, which infest the crystals there, have increased greatly in number, and threaten to spill out into our laps. Since you have proven yourself a competent slayer, let us see if your <class> skills are the match of an adult drake. Find the Singing Ridge by heading south through the Scalewing Shelf. Enter and slay their brood mother, Dreadwing.Understanding the Mok'Nathal^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Leoroxx^Leoroxx^Understanding the Mok'Nathal^The Stones of Vekh'nir^The Totems of My Enemy^Slay Vekh, leader of the Vekh'nir arakkoa.^<Leoroxx looks you in the eye with the kind of stare that chills your soul.> You come to the Mok'Nathal, but you do not understand us. You do not understand our struggle to survive. If you would understand us, then you will have to endure a taste of that struggle. To the south are the Vekh'nir arakkoa. They have enslaved a group of ogres in the caverns known as Trogma's Claim and their leader, Vekh is in there. Slay him!The Eyes of Skettis^62^All^Terokkar Forest^Rilak the Redeemed^Rilak the Redeemed^Surrender to the Horde^^^Bring the Eye of Reskk and the Eye of Shienor to Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.^Doom harkens from the cliffs of Skettis. My people, the arakkoa, face a fate shrouded in unspeakable evil. Too often have we abused dark magic for wrongdoing. Through A'dal I have learned of the Light and of redemption. Terokk watches his colonies from Skettis through orbs enchanted by the black art. Steal these Eyes from Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor in northern Terokkar. Let me see what Terokk sees. Let me look through the eyes of Skettis.Veil Rhaze: Unliving Evil^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Kirrik the Awakened^Kirrik the Awakened^Surrender to the Horde^^^Kill 4 Deathtalon Spirits, 4 Screeching Spirits and 2 Spirit Ravens and return to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan.^Veil Rhaze was a particularly wicked colony of Skettis. Despite the village's eradication by the Auchindoun disaster, Terokk's influence remained in the maligned spirits there. Travel west to Veil Rhaze and slay those murderous wretches. You'll find them to the west of the Shadow Tomb, on the border of Bone Wastes and Terokkar Forest. This will be our first blow against Terokk and the guardians of Skettis.Seek Out Kirrik^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Rilak the Redeemed^Kirrik the Awakened^Surrender to the Horde^^The Tomb of Lights, Vengeful Souls, Missing Friends^Take Rilak's Missive to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes.^Other arakkoa took part in the betrayal of Terokk. Kirrik recognized Terokk as a charlatan, not a prophet. The only prophecy Terokk envisioned was the doom borne of his own bidding. It was Kirrik who led us bravely from Skettis. After our pilgrimage to Shattrath, Kirrik traveled to the colonies in search of others. This missive tells of what the Eyes have seen. Kirrik must be told! Follow the road south out of Shattrath to the Bone Wastes and look for the caravan.The Totems of My Enemy^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Spiritcaller Dohgar^Spiritcaller Dohgar^The Totems of My Enemy^Understanding the Mok'Nathal^^Collect 5 Bladespire Totems.^There is the right way to honor one's ancestors, and there is the wrong way. The Bladespire ogres carry totems with them, but they do not use them to show their respect. Instead, they seek to use them to manipulate and control. We should steal their totems because they are unworthy! We will then put them to better use. Go to the Bladespire Outpost to the west, just southwest of the Razor Ridge. Slay the Bladespire mystics and crushers, and take their totems from them!Missing Friends^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Ethan^Ethan^^Seek Out Kirrik^^Ethan wants you to find 12 of his missing friends in Veil Skith and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan.^We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise. It was scary. I don't know when we are going to get moving again. Some of my friends are missing though. I don't know where they are. I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest. They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff. If you find them that would be great. I'm kind of worried about them.Spirit Calling^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Spiritcaller Dohgar^Spiritcaller Dohgar^The Totems of My Enemy^^^Use the Spirit Calling Totems to collect 8 Lesser Nether Drake Spirits.^The spirits of the nether drakes in the Singing Ridge are in need of liberation. The nether drakes were not always nether drakes. They used to be black drakes. But then, with the destruction of this world, a wave of nether energy washed over everything and had the side-effect of changing the drakeling eggs. Now they are all twisted versions of their former selves. We must help them to find peace. Do this by slaying a drake near to the spirit calling totem, and then take its spirit from it.The Force of Neltharaku^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Neltharaku^Neltharaku^Kindness^^^Neltharaku, flying high above Netherwing Fields in Shadowmoon Valley, wants you to free 5 Enslaved Netherwing Drakes.^Take this enchanted nethervine crystal and make your way back to Dragonmaw Fortress. Once there, seek out the enslaved drakes and invoke the magic of the nethervine crystal. My own energies will pour forth, causing the drakes to break free from the bond of their captors. When you see that the drake has broken free, help it defeat its captor! It will most assuredly be weak from the imprisonment. Release all that you can find and return to me, <name>.Fel Reavers, No Thanks!^69^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Fel Reavers, No Thanks!^^^Obtain 5 Condensed Nether Gas from Gan'arg Mekgineers at Forge Base: Oblivion, northwest of the Stormspire, and load them into a nearby Inactive Fel Reaver. Return to Nether-Stalker Nauthis after you've completed this task.^Ah, yes - the fel reaver! Certainly the Legion's most terrible mechanical creation. There are no less than three of these abominations aimed at the Stormspire. Fortunately for us, they are not active yet. This affords us the possibility of dealing with them through sabotage instead of brute force. Obtain condensed nether gas from the gan'arg at Forge Base: Oblivion and fill a nearby fel reaver's fuel tank with it. I've a feeling its engine won't handle it too well.The Best Defense^69^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Fel Reavers, No Thanks!^^^Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to slay 12 Wrathbringers at Forge Base: Gehenna, north of the Stormspire.^Brave acts of industrial sabotage will only get us so far, <name>. Just as Forge Base: Oblivion serves as an assembly site for Fel Reavers, Forge Base: Gehenna serves as a staging ground for their army as it is where the majority of the Legion's teleportation devices are located. I want you to go in there and put a dent in their numbers. They must have a full regiment of wrathbringers by now and we just can't allow that.Teleport This!^69^All^Netherstorm^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Nether-Stalker Nauthis^Fel Reavers, No Thanks!^^^Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to use the Mental Interference Rod on the Mo'arg at Forge Base: Gehenna and use their Detonate Teleporter ability on the three teleporters in the forge camp.^As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill. Unfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy... but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do. Take this rod... I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies. Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see. You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters.Karynaku^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Neltharaku^Karynaku^Kindness^^Zuluhed the Whacked^Seek out Karynaku at Dragonmaw Fortress.^It shames me to ask for your assistance once more, <name>, but you are my flight's only hope. Without my mate, the netherwing brood may die out completely. Make your way to the top of Dragonmaw Fortress and find Karynaku. We will be flying overhead. Should a break appear in their defenses, the might of the netherwing will swoop down to assist you.Gather the Orbs^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Spiritcaller Dohgar^Spiritcaller Dohgar^The Totems of My Enemy^^^Use the Orb Collecting Totem to collect 15 Razaani Light Orbs.^The Razaani ethereals have strange devices that emit small, pink floating light orbs. They remind me of souls. They are not to be confused with the large yellow balls that break free of the ethereal when they die, these are something else entirely. I'd like for you to head north to Razaan's Landing and drop some totems, which will attact the pink light orbs. Bring them back to me so that I might determine exactly what they are.Mok'Nathal Treats^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Matron Varah^Matron Varah^^^^Collect 3 Raptor Ribs and 3 Serpent Flesh.^Hungry, <race>? The Great Spirit helps those that help themselves. If you want to earn a meal, I suggest that you listen up, because Braagor there isn't going to give you anything for free, nor as tasty! The raptors and scalewings of Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf have everything that's needed for two of the most delicious dishes you'll ever taste. Bring me their raptor ribs and serpent flesh, and I'll make some of each for you. I may even teach you how to cook them up for yourself, if you hurry.Veil Lithic: Preemptive Strike^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Kirrik the Awakened^Kirrik the Awakened^Surrender to the Horde^^^Break the cursed eggs in Veil Lithic. Redeem 3 Hatchlings and slay 3 Malevolent Hatchlings before returning to Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan.^In the wretched colony to the southwest known as Veil Lithic, Terokk's minions are attempting to befoul their avian brethren before they hatch. The dark sorcerers of Lithic encase eggs in a shadowy curse. When the hatchlings emerge, they mindlessly serve Terrok. Travel to Veil Lithic and prematurely break the eggs before the curse has time to seep in. Even if you are too late, you can put down the tainted ones. Remember, the Light shines brightest in the darkness.Surrender to the Horde^63^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Rokag^Rilak the Redeemed^Surrender to the Horde^^The Eyes of Skettis^Rokag wants you to seek out Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City and demand that he and his people surrender to the Horde.^The cowardly arakkoa attack us daily. They ambush our hunters and sometimes even raid inside our walls. We kill them when we can, but their magic is strong and they often escape our warbands. I have learned that some arakkoa claim to be friendly with the Horde. They live in Shattrath City to the northwest. Rilak the Redeemed is their leader. Search for him in the Lower City, and when you find him, demand his surrender.Secrets of the Arakkoa^63^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Lady Dena Kennedy^Rilak the Redeemed^Secrets of the Arakkoa^^The Eyes of Skettis^Lady Dena Kennedy wants you to seek out Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City and find out what secrets he will share of the Arakkoa.^Out here on the frontier we have to deal with the arakkoa every day. They strike at us when they please, raiding our supply lines and killing our scouts. Yet we know very little about these enigmatic creatures. I have received news that northwest of here in Shattrath City there are arakkoa who are not hostile. They might be willing to share the secrets of their race. Rilak the Redeemed is their leader. He resides in the northern part of the Lower City.A Burden of Souls^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Antonivich^Apothecary Antonivich^Boiling Blood^^^Kill 20 Shattered Hand orcs, then return to Apothecary Antonivich in Thrallmar.^I have a device, the Demoniac Scryer, that can analyze fel magic. I would have you use the Scryer, but first... you must appease it. The Scryer, you see, has trapped within it a creature of vast intelligence and its needs are, shall we say, quite eccentric. To appease the Scryer, you must kill orcs. Specifically, they must be Shattered Hand orcs -- the Scryer demands their souls. Return to me when the souls are reaped. You will find the orcs north, and south, and surrounding... Hellfire Citadel.Inform Leoroxx!^68^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Spiritcaller Dohgar^Leoroxx^The Totems of My Enemy^^There Can Be Only One Response^Speak with Leoroxx about what the Razaani ethereal are up to. He can be found at Mok'Nathal Village in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Quickly, you must inform Leoroxx of what is transpiring up at Razaan's Landing! Those orbs were comprised of souls, some of them Mok'Nathal!Zuluhed the Whacked^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Karynaku^Karynaku^Zuluhed the Whacked^Karynaku^^Kill Zuluhed the Whacked and recover Zuluhed's Key. Use Zuluhed's Key on Zuluhed's Chains to free Karynaku.^He hides in my thoughts, mortal. He waits for me to break... for me to bend to his will. And this will be his undoing. I will call for him. I will tell him that I will do as he asks. When he appears, kill him and take the key! Know this: Zuluhed is an ancient orc with unknown powers. He has surely been empowered further by Illidan. You risk your life for me in doing as I ask. Are you certain you wish to make such a sacrifice?There Can Be Only One Response^68^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Leoroxx^Spiritcaller Dohgar^^Inform Leoroxx!^^Collect the Collection of Souls.^There can be only one response to this... this, DEFILEMENT of the souls of our ancestors! <name>, if you would aid us to restore the souls of our honored dead to their rightful place, go back to Razaan's Landing. Go back up there and kill the razaani until their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan shows his cowardly face. Kill him and get those souls back, and then give them over to Spiritcaller Dohgar!Arakkoa War Path^62^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Advisor Faila^Advisor Faila^^^^Advisor Faila asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to her in Stonebreaker Hold.^The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could charge out to meet them in numbers. They use their summoning circles to rescue their warriors from certain death but they cannot run from us if we attack their homes. Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northeast. Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can.Thin the Flock^62^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Lieutenant Gravelhammer^Lieutenant Gravelhammer^^^^Lieutenant Gravelhammer asks that you kill 14 Shienor Talonites and 6 Shienor Sorcerers and then return to him in Allerian Stronghold.^The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could marshal our soldiers. Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northwest. Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can. They may not fear us, but at least we can thin their numbers.Ally of the Netherwing^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Karynaku^Mordenai^Zuluhed the Whacked^^Blood Oath of the Netherwing^Let Karynaku return you to Mordenai in the Netherwing Fields.^Allow me to return you to Mordenai. I am certain that he wishes to see you once more.Taken in the Night^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Scout Navrin^Scout Navrin^^^^Scout Navrin wants you to travel to the Netherweb Ridge and free 6 Webbed Sha'tar Warriors and then return to him at Sha'tari Base Camp.^Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago, we were raided by the spiders of Netherweb Ridge, on the southeastern edge of the Bone Wastes. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in webs and carried them away. Some of our warriors took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders. We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties since. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the spiders. Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people?Veil Shalas: Signal Fires^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Kirrik the Awakened^Kirrik the Awakened^Surrender to the Horde^^^Kirrik the Awakened at the Refugee Caravan wants you to extinguish the four signal fires of Veil Shalas.^Terokk's perch, Skettis, looms above the Bone Wastes to the east. At the base of Skettis lies Veil Shalas, the most formidable of Terokk's colonies. It is through the stronghold of Veil Shalas that Terokk's forward sages wage war against the Light. The evil-doers of Shalas communicate with their master using a complex system of magical signal fires. Travel to the east, <race>, and extinguish the fires. Once Veil Shalas is silenced, we can begin to plot the fall of Skettis. But I get ahead of myself.Report to Nazgrel^61^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Apothecary Antonivich^Nazgrel^Boiling Blood^^^Speak with Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^<name>, during your foray with the Demoniac Scryer, I sent word of your exploits against the fel orcs. Nazgrel, our illustrious leader in Thrallmar, wishes to speak with you. I believe he has a bloody mission in mind...The Foot of the Citadel^63^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Nazgrel^Nazgrel^Boiling Blood^^^Kill Force Commander Gorax, place the Challenge From the Horde upon his corpse, kill The Hand of Kargath, and then bring the Head of the Hand of Kargath to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.^Force Commander Gorax is training Shattered Hand captains at the base of Hellfire Citadel, honing them to a bloody razor's edge. You must kill him, <name>, for his loss would be a mighty blow to the fel orcs. However, that is not all you must do. Take this banner. Place it atop Gorax's corpse. Gorax's commander, the Hand of Kargath, must answer your challenge if he has even a drop of true orc blood within him! His head, the head of the hand of Kargath, is what I seek.The Dread Relic^66^All^Terokkar Forest^Oakun^Oakun^The Dread Relic^^^Oakun wants you to travel east to the Derelict Caravan to recover the Dread Relic. Return to Oakun when the task is complete.^Long ago a caravan went to Auchindoun with a mission to take a Dread Relic from the ancient tombs beneath the necropolis. They fled, but the relic was their undoing. The relic is evil and it summons evil when touched. Their caravan was destroyed somewhere to the east. This dark artifact is the key to a terrible plan to defeat Teribus the Cursed, a creature that flies over the Bone Wastes. Help me if you wish, but your life and even your soul will be at risk.Before Darkness Falls^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Mekeda^Mekeda^^^^Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan wants you to kill 8 Cabal Skirmishers, 4 Cabal Spell-Weavers and 2 Cabal Initiates.^After our caravan fell prey to an attack by Shadow Council cabal cultists, scouts were sent to Shattrath to call for help. The guards think we're safe for now, but they underestimate these madmen. I, for one, am not looking forward to having my throat slit by some cabal initiate in the middle of the night. Do us all a favor and take the fight to them, before they come to us. You will find our attackers south of here, at Auchindoun's northern entrance.The Skettis Offensive^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Defender Grashna^Rilak the Redeemed^^Return to Shattrath^^Hold off the attackers and speak with Rilak the Redeemed.^Skettis has waged war on us! Have you gathered enough to help with Shattrath's defense? Hold off the attackers!Cabal Orders^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Cabal Orders^Mekeda^Cabal Orders^^^Bring the Cabal Orders to Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan in the Bone Wastes.^This message bears a dark seal and though the language seems somewhat familiar, it appears to be encoded. Perhaps someone at the Refugee Caravan will know something about it.The Shadow Tomb^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Mekeda^Mekeda^Cabal Orders^^^Go into the Shadow Tomb, west of the Refugee Caravan and retrieve the Drape of Arunen, the Gavel of K'alen and the Scroll of Atalor. Return to Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan after you've completed this task.^Many believe it was the Shadow Council that caused the explosion that tore Auchindoun apart. It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside. If that is true, then that evil must have turned against them. According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun. They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun. Three of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor. I must ask you to retrieve them.Harbinger of Doom^70^All^Tempest Keep^A'dal^A'dal^Special Delivery to Shattrath City^^^You have been tasked to go to Tempest Keep's Arcatraz satellite and slay Harbinger Skyriss. Return to A'dal at the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City after you have done so.^<A discordant note can be detected in A'dal's 'voice'.> Prince Kael'thas has chosen his warden poorly, and now the entities that we kept locked up within the Arcatraz are breaking free. One in particular, a servant of the Old Gods known as Harbinger Skyriss, seeks to usher in his masters' vision of conquering all of the worlds in the universe. <name>, you must not allow him to escape. Return to Tempest Keep, enter the Arcatraz, and slay Harbinger Skyriss before it is too late!The Tempest Key^70^All^Shattrath City^Khadgar^A'dal^^The Cipher of Damnation^Trial of the Naaru: Mercy, Trial of the Naaru: Strength, Trial of the Naaru: Tenacity^Speak with A'dal in Shattrath City.^You have proven yourself capable of great feats, <name>. Your discovery of the Cipher of Damnation and Kael'Thas' involvement is most important to our cause. Should Kael use the cipher, what little is left of this world may collapse. A'dal is convinced that Kael must be stopped and now seeks adventurers willing to undergo trials. Those that prove their strength will be granted favor by the naaru. <Khadgar nods.> A'dal awaits...Trial of the Naaru: Mercy^70^All^Shattrath City^A'dal^A'dal^^The Tempest Key^Trial of the Naaru: Magtheridon^A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to recover the Unused Axe of the Executioner from the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel.^Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. Within the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel are three of your people. They are held there by the merciless one, Kargath Bladefist. He seeks to execute them as a sign of his virility and power. You must save these prisoners before such an atrocity can come to pass. As proof of deed, bring me the unused axe of the executioner. It must not have a drop of blood on its blade!Trial of the Naaru: Strength^70^All^Shattrath City^A'dal^A'dal^^The Tempest Key^Trial of the Naaru: Magtheridon^A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to recover Kalithresh's Trident and Murmur's Essence.^Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. The trial of strength is divided in two. You must destroy the leader of the Coilfang Steamvaults, Warlord Kalithresh, and bring me his trident. Slay the extra-planar being known as Murmur, in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun, and bring me his essence. Do this and you will have passed the trial of strength.Trial of the Naaru: Tenacity^70^All^Shattrath City^A'dal^A'dal^^The Tempest Key^Trial of the Naaru: Magtheridon^A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to rescue Millhouse Manastorm from the Arcatraz of Tempest Keep.^Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. In our travels we have encountered many dangerous beings. Some of these beings we incarcerated and placed in what is now known as the Arcatraz of Tempest Keep. There is one prisoner, however, that is a victim of circumstance. A stowaway who was in the wrong naaru vessel at the wrong time. Venture to the Arcatraz and rescue the gnome, Millhouse Manastorm. Ensure his survival.Escaping the Tomb^64^All^Terokkar Forest^Akuno^Mekeda^^^^Help Akuno find his way to the Refugee Caravan. Speak to Mekeda after you've completed this quest.^I appreciate your help, <name>. I was certain I was going to be killed. Let's get out of here with a hurry. It won't be long before more cultists come after us.Return to Shattrath^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Kirrik the Awakened^Rilak the Redeemed^Surrender to the Horde^^The Skettis Offensive^Travel to Shattrath City and speak with Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City.^Your actions, while brave, will surely rouse a vindictive response from Terokk. Hurry to Shattrath. Send word to Rilak!Imperial Plate Armor^50^Alliance^Blacksmithing^Myolor Sunderfury^Derotain Mudsipper^^^^Speak with Derotain Mudsipper at Gadgetzan in Tanaris.^There's a dwarf in Gadgetzan by the name of Derotain Mudsipper who'll teach you how to make imperial plate armor. All you gotta do is get to the Tanaris desert and find him. Interested?Imperial Plate Armor^50^Horde^Blacksmithing^Krathok Moltenfist^Derotain Mudsipper^^^^Speak with Derotain Mudsipper at Gadgetzan in Tanaris.^There's a dwarf in Gadgetzan by the name of Derotain Mudsipper who'll teach you how to make imperial plate armor. All you gotta do is get to the Tanaris desert and find him. Interested?Longtail is the Lynchpin^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Watcher Moonshade^Watcher Moonshade^Wyrmskull Watcher^^^Slay Draaca Longtail, the leader of the wyrmcultists in the Wyrmskull Tunnel.^With the Blackwing wyrmcultists massing in the tunnel, we're hard pressed to deal with the situation. Quite frankly, they have the numbers. And while we've been able to take care of any of their people that get too close, the fact remains that if they attack in earnest, we're going to be overrun. The situation calls for someone to get through to the other end of the tunnel, and take out their leader, Draaca Longtail. Up for some fun?Wyrmskull Watcher^67^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Tree Warden Chawn^Watcher Moonshade^Wyrmskull Watcher^Did You Get The Note?^^Deliver the Meeting Note to Watcher Moonshade at the entrance of the Wyrmskull Tunnel in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Hmm, I'm not certain what we should do. I'm not much of a military planner. Watcher Moonshade will know what to do. He's heading up our defensive efforts at the Wyrmskull Tunnel to the west at the end of Wyrmskull Bridge. We have a force out there just in case the cultists try anything funny. Please, take the note to him with all due haste.Zeth'Gor Must Burn!^60^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Wing Commander Dabir'ee^Wing Commander Dabir'ee^^^^Use the smoke beacon at each of Zeth'Gor's towers, and then return to Wing Commander Dabir'ee at Expedition Point.^It's time to strike Zeth'Gor from the air! Our gryphon riders are ready for a sortie, <name>. But they need someone on the ground to direct their fire. Are you ready for a covert mission? Take these smoke beacons into Zeth'Gor, the Bleeding Hollow stronghold to the west. They have four guard towers: one near their northern wall, one near their southern wall, one near their forge and another nestled in their foothills. Place a beacon underneath each of the towers and we'll fly in and bomb them!The Infested Protectors^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Lakotae^Lakotae^^^^Lakotae wants you to kill 25 Wood Mites and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan. The mites can be found living inside the bodies of Rotting Forest-Ragers and Infested Root-Walkers.^The trees of this land are ravaged by the power that was unleashed from Auchindoun. The foul magic that was unleashed blasted the land into the wastes you see all around. The trees that survived are now infested with wretched wood mites that crawl under their bark and gnaw at their flesh. Rotting forest-rages and infested root-walkers are breeding grounds for the mites. They are found along the edge of the wood to the east. Destroy these creatures and then kill the mites that flee their husks.Master of Potions^70^All^Alchemy^Lauranna Thar'well^Lauranna Thar'well^Master of Potions^^^Lauranna Thar'well wants you to go to the Botanica in Tempest Keep and retrieve the Botanist's Field Guide from High Botanist Freywinn. In addition she also wants you to bring her 5 Super Healing Potions, 5 Super Mana Potions and 5 Major Dreamless Sleep Potions.^As you know, plants have properties that allow alchemists to re-energize and reinvigorate others through potions. My familiarity with the plants of Outland allows me to teach alchemists how to make the most out of them. If you're interested in expanding your knowledge of potions, I have but one task to ask of you. High Botanist Freywinn in Tempest Keep is rumored to have written a comprehensive botany guide. Bring it to me along with samples of your work and I'll teach you the knowledge you seek.Skywing^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Skywing^Rilak the Redeemed^^^^Escort Skywing and report to Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City.^Skywing flutters around you. You get the feeling he wants you to follow him.Master of Transmutation^70^All^Alchemy^Zarevhi^Zarevhi^Master of Transmutation^^^Zarevhi at the Stormspire in Netherstorm wants you to bring him 4 Primal Mights.^Any alchemist will tell you that matter is malleable, any substance can be transformed into another - but nothing is really created or destroyed. A true master of transmutation can learn to overcome this limitation - and I can teach you how to obtain this mastery! As a prospective transmuter you're undoubtedly familiar with primal might - the combination of the material representation of all primal forces. Show me proof of your transmuting prowess and I will share my knowledge with you.The Cudgel of Kar'desh^70^All^The Slave Pens^Skar'this the Heretic^Skar'this the Heretic^^The Mark of Vashj^^Skar'this the Heretic in the heroic Slave Pens of Coilfang Reservoir wants you to bring him the Earthen Signet and the Blazing Signet.^Bring me the elemental signets that the cudgel requires! The earthen signet is held by Gruul the Dragonkiller. Gruul can be found inside his lair in the Blade's Edge Mountains. The second signet is the blazing heart of a creature known as Nightbane. This mythical beast is said to reside in the hallowed halls of the prophet, Medivh. Make haste!Master of Elixirs^70^All^Alchemy^Lorokeem^Lorokeem^Master of Elixirs^^^Go to the Black Morass in the Caverns of Time and obtain 10 Essences of Infinity from Rift Lords and Rift Keepers. Bring these along with 5 Elixirs of Major Defense, 5 Elixirs of Mastery and 5 Elixirs of Major Agility to Lorokeem in Shattrath's Lower City.^I've devoted my life to perfecting my elixirs. Despite my success, I haven't been able to create an elixir of eternal life. I think I know the reagent I'm missing. I've heard of a place called the Caverns of Time in Azeroth where intruders known as rift lords and rift keepers phase in and out of the timeline. This intrusive time-shifting creates tears in time itself, twisting it infinitely into crystallized essences. Bring these to me along with samples of your work and I'll teach you all I know.Return to Honor Hold^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Corporal Ironridge^Assistant Klatu^Cursed Talismans^^Fel Spirits, Digging for Prayer Beads^Speak with Assistant Klatu, at Honor Hold's inn.^<name>, while you were on your mission in Zeth'Gor, I received news of my commanding officer, Colonel Jules. He was stricken with a demonic corruption while fighting near the Gor'gaz Outpost, and his situation has grown very bad. You have made such great gains for us against the fel orcs. Your strength in battle is without question... is your spirit just as strong? Please, return to Honor Hold and speak with Klatu, in an upper room at the Honor Hold inn.Harvesting the Fel Ammunition^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Evergrove Druid^Evergrove Druid^Damaged Mask^^^Collect 5 Fel Cannonballs.^We must shut down the Burning Legion's access to Death's Door, but first you're going to destroy their two warp-gates! The problem is, we can't even scratch one of those things, so you're going to need to use their own weapons against them. The death's might, death's watch, deathforge over-smiths and deathforge technicians carry the ammunition for the fel cannons. Normally it wouldn't affect any of them, but if you bring the cannonballs to me, I will imbue them with Nature's unbridled wrath!Master of Potions^70^All^Alchemy^Apothecary Antonivich^Lauranna Thar'well^Master of Potions^^Master of Potions^Speak to Lauranna Thar'well at Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^My knowledge of alchemy is vast. It is, however, general in nature. If you wish to specialize, you will have to find others who have narrower fields of study. If you wish to specialize in potion creation, I would recommend that you seek the help of Lauranna Thar'well of the Cenarion Expedition. Her knowledge of plants will allow you to make the most of your raw materials. Look for her in Zangarmarsh and tell her I sent you to her.Master of Elixirs^70^All^Alchemy^Apothecary Antonivich^Lorokeem^Master of Elixirs^^Master of Potions^Speak to Lorokeem in Shattrath's Lower City.^My knowledge of alchemy is vast. It is, however, general in nature. If you wish to specialize, you will have to find others who have narrower fields of study. If you wish to specialize in elixir creation, I would recommend that you seek the help of the arakkoa known as Lorokeem. His knowledge of elixirs is unmatched, yet he squanders his skill pursuing an elixir of eternal life. Find him and see what he can teach you.Master of Transmutation^70^All^Alchemy^Apothecary Antonivich^Zarevhi^Master of Transmutation^^Master of Potions^Speak to Zarevhi at the Stormspire in Netherstorm.^My knowledge of alchemy is vast. It is, however, general in nature. If you wish to specialize, you will have to find others who have narrower fields of study. If you wish to specialize in transmutation, I would recommend that you seek the help of the ethereal known as Zarevhi. He resides in the Stormspire in Netherstorm. His mastery of transmutation is... well, outlandish! See what you can learn from him, but beware - ethereals drive a hard bargain.Speak with Rilak the Redeemed^63^All^Terokkar Forest^Kirrik the Awakened^Rilak the Redeemed^Speak with Rilak the Redeemed^^The Eyes of Skettis^Kirrik the Awakened wants you to speak with Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.^You look surprised to be talking to me. I do not blame you. My people, the arakkoa, deserve to be feared. Speak with Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City if you wish to know more. He can be found in the northern part of the Lower City, with the other outcasts of Skettis. And, <name>, we will speak again.Fel Spirits^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Assistant Klatu^Assistant Klatu^^Return to Honor Hold^The Exorcism of Colonel Jules^Klatu in Honor Hold wants you to use the Anchorite Relic at Gor'gaz Outpost southwest of Honor Hold, slay Shattered Hand Berserkers near the relic, and then slay 10 released Fel Spirits to avenge Colonel Jules.^Colonel Jules was cursed in a battle near the Gor'gaz Outpost, a haunt for Shattered Hand fel orcs. My master, Barada, works feverishly to cure the poor human, but he needs help. The Colonel's tormented spirit seeks peace, and his path to peace is, I fear, a path of vengeance. Take this anchorite relic to Gor'gaz Outpost. Place it upon the ground near Shattered Hand orcs and defeat them. This will release their fel spirits -- you must slay those fel spirits for Jules' own spirit's recovery.Death's Door^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Wildlord Antelarion^Evergrove Druid^Damaged Mask^^^Use the Druid Signal at Death's Door to call down and speak with an Evergrove Druid.^Now there is an even greater threat from the Burning Legion. To the south is a portal known as Death's Door, which opens upon the horrific world where the Legion breeds its deadly hounds. To get there, exit Evergrove by heading east up the ramp. Follow the path south, through the Bladed Gulch, Razaan's Landing, Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf. Then, take the ramp down into the Vekhaar Stand and enter Death's Door through the tunnel, south of Mok'Nathal. Once there, use this druid signal.Fire At Will!^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Evergrove Druid^Evergrove Druid^Damaged Mask^^^Use the Naturalized Ammunition to take control of the Death's Door Fel Cannons. Use the cannons to destroy both the South Warp-Gate and the North Warp-Gate.^Now that the ammunition can affect the Burning Legion, it's time for you to use it. There are two warp-gates, which are used for teleportation and enhancement of the void terrors. One is in the south and the other in the north, and each is within range of a fel cannon. Use the naturalized ammunition to take control of each fel cannon and destroy the warp-gates. Attack the gate with artillery to begin, and be prepared to kill its defenders to keep the cannon alive if necessary.The Hound-Master^68^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Evergrove Druid^Wildlord Antelarion^Damaged Mask^^^Slay Baelmon the Hound-Master.^Baelmon the Hound-Master must die! He maintains the ritual that keeps the portal functioning. The Death's Door portal is located at the north end of the canyon. When you find it, you will find Baelmon. You're going to need help on this one, so take this wand. When you battle the Hound-Master, use it and a couple of my friends will come to your aid. After you have defeated Baelmon, return to Wildlord Antelarion. And, <name>, thank you for all that you've gone through for us here.An Improper Burial^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Commander Ra'vaj^Commander Ra'vaj^An Improper Burial^^^Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to burn 8 Slain Auchenai Warriors and 8 Slain Sha'tar Vindicators.^Is there nothing that can be done to stem the tide of corruption? My soldiers have been battling the Auchenai for days now with no end in sight. Each casualty, whether Auchenai or Sha'tar, is snatched from the battlefield - their souls lifted and taken to parts unknown. I will not have it! A proper burial is out of the question but those fiends will not have their souls! Take this torch and travel to the field of battle, directly east of here. Burn every corpse you see! We will not fuel their rituals.A Hero Is Needed^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Commander Ra'vaj^Commander Ra'vaj^An Improper Burial^^^Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to slay 12 Auchenai Initiates and 5 Auchenai Doomsayers.^It is not enough. A hero is needed. Our forces are overwhelmed as the Auchenai continue to grow in number. <Commander Ra'vaj looks at you.> Will you be the hero? Return to the field of battle and strike at their soldiers. Keep them occupied so that my scouts can get behind their lines and see what they are creating.The Fallen Exarch^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Commander Ra'vaj^Commander Ra'vaj^An Improper Burial^^^Commander Ra'vaj at the Sha'tari Outpost in the Bone Wastes of Terokkar Forest wants you to destroy the contents of the Auchenai Coffin.^They are feeding the souls they steal to a coffin that they have dragged out from the Auchenai Crypts. My scouts believe the contents of the coffin to contain the first exarch of the crypts. They seek to resurrect the ancient one! You must battle your way to the western side of Auchindoun and disturb the contents of that coffin before they feed it enough souls. Should you lose your way, follow the walking souls. Destroy whatever is inside that coffin!Digging for Prayer Beads^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Assistant Klatu^Assistant Klatu^^Return to Honor Hold^The Exorcism of Colonel Jules^Recover the Draenei Prayer Beads and bring them to Assistant Klatu in Honor Hold.^Anchorite Barada plans to exorcise the corruption from Colonel Jules, and will require an assistant for the task. Such an assistant must be prepared... I am ashamed to admit that my prayer beads were lost in Honor Hold's courtyard. I believe the dog Fei Fei stole them and buried them, but I do not know where. If you speak with his master, Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell, perhaps she will know where Fei Fei hides his stolen treasures.The Outcast's Plight^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Vekax^Vekax^^^More Feathers^Bring 30 Arakkoa Feathers to Vekax in Shattrath's Lower City.^As an outcast, I am marked by death by arakkoa loyal to the city of Skettis. I cannot leave these walls for fear of my life, but that doesn't mean I cannot strike at them in retaliation. I have a small cache of treasure that I'm willing to part with, should you help me strike back at my would-be assassins. Bring me feathers from the denizens of the various Veils of Terokkar as proof of their demise.For the Fallen^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Vindicator Haylen^Vindicator Haylen^For the Fallen^^^Vindicator Haylen wants you to slay 20 Dreadfang Widows and then return to him just west of Netherweb Ridge.^When the dreadfang widows attacked our outpost we heard the voice of the naaru calling us to battle. We pursued the creatures into the night. Some of our people we found dead in the dark, others we could hear struggling against their captors. By morning we had come to this place and we fought a fierce battle but we were beaten. Dreadfang poison will soon take my companions and I cannot last long. Before I die I must know that the dreadfang widows were beaten.Terokkarantula^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Vindicator Haylen^Vindicator Haylen^For the Fallen^^^Vindicator Haylen wants you to kill the Terokkarantula and then return to him west of Netherweb Ridge.^You have slain many of the dreadfang widows but they will continue to spawn and soon they will strike at us again. Deep within Netherweb Ridge is the lair of the Terokkarantula, the brood-mother of these gruesome creatures. If we are to be safe, she must die.Digging Through Bones^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Chief Archaeologist Letoll^Dwarfowitz^Digging Through Bones^^^Escort Letoll and his crew and protect them while they make their dig. Return to Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Outpost if you succeed.^Oy! You look like you can take care of yerself, <race>. Me and the crew here are looking for a bodyguard to watch over us while we hit a dig site to the north. The pay is pretty good and all you gotta do is make sure no nasty creatures kill me or any of my employees. If you successfully make it back without any casualties, Dwarfowitz over there will pay ya.Evil Draws Near^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Oakun^Oakun^The Dread Relic^^^Oakun wants you to take the Dread Relic to the Writhing Mound. Once there, kill Auchenai Death-Speakers and Auchenai Doomsayers to collect 20 Doom Skulls. Then find the Writhing Mound Summoning Circle and use the Dread Relic to summon and destroy Teribus the Cursed. Return to Oakun when the deed is done.^Now you must use the Dread Relic in a foul necromantic ritual if you wish to challenge Teribus the Cursed. To the northeast, beyond Auchindoun, is the Writhing Mound, a place where necromancers gather. The auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments. If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you.Bloody Imp-ossible!^69^All^Netherstorm^Sab'aoth^Sab'aoth^^^^Bring 8 vials of Warp Chaser Blood to Sab'aoth at Cosmowrench.^The blood of the warp chasers in this area is a powerful and rare reagent. It's one of my biggest sellers. Normally, I take my imp, Zeppit, out to help me gather it. Warp chaser blood is simply too caustic to be handled safely by you or I, but it doesn't bother Zeppit. Things are getting busier here at the shop, so if I send Zeppit with you, will you help gather the blood? Zeppit's attention tends to wander, so you'll need to be close to the chaser when it dies for Zeppit to do his work.Return to Sha'tari Base Camp^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Vindicator Haylen^Scout Navrin^For the Fallen^^^Vindicator Haylen wants you to return to the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes and speak with Scout Navrin.^We will not make it back on our own. The dreadfang poison is too strong. You must return to Sha'tari Base Camp for us. Scout Navrin will send a rescue party out to find us.Killing the Crawlers^65^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Sentinel Moonwhisper^Commander Skyshadow^^^^Slay 6 Cavern Crawlers.^Commander Skyshadow wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with the Harborage. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Commander Skyshadow at once!Killing the Crawlers^65^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Grunt Grahk^Tor'chunk Twoclaws^^^^Slay 6 Cavern Crawlers.^Tor'chunk Twoclaws wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with Swamp Rat. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Tor'chunk Twoclaws at once!Fumping^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Dwarfowitz^Dwarfowitz^Digging Through Bones^^^Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes wants you to bring him 8 Mature Bone Sifter Carcasses.^How would you like to do a little more work for the Explorers' League? These bone worms have us all quite intrigued. I've got a drum right here that you can use out in the Bone Wastes. Just bang on the damned thing and see what you get. If it's a worm, kill it and bring back the carcass for us to study. We'll need a good lot of carcasses to get a valid testing sample.The Big Bone Worm^65^All^Terokkar Forest^Dwarfowitz^Dwarfowitz^Digging Through Bones^^^Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Base Camp in the Bone Wastes wants you to recover Enormous Bone Worm Organs.^I was right! These carcasses you brought me belong to the baby bone worms. Do you know what that means? It means that somewhere out there is a big one! I think we can get it to come out if we can provide the right kind of food. Let's see... something big! Yes! I remember seeing clefthooves east of here on the other side of the Bone Wastes. Get out there and kill a clefthoof. Once it's dead, use the drums. Hopefully the big one will come up to feed. If you manage to kill it, bring me its organs!The Exorcism of Colonel Jules^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Assistant Klatu^Assistant Klatu^The Exorcism of Colonel Jules^Fel Spirits, Digging for Prayer Beads^^Speak with Anchorite Barada. Use the prayer beads to help with the ritual, and then speak with Colonel Jules when he is saved. Finally, return to Assistant Klatu.^<name>, it is time to save Colonel Jules. His condition has worsened and Barada fears that, if we do not cleanse him of his corruption, he will be lost to us. Take the prayer beads you found and speak with Anchorite Barada to begin the ritual. Let no disruptions stop the ritual... and if all goes well, Colonel Jules will be saved. Speak with Jules when he is saved, then return to me.Trollbane is Looking for You^61^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Assistant Klatu^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^The Exorcism of Colonel Jules^^^Assistant Klatu has informed you that Force Commander Danath Trollbane has been seeking you. Speak to him in the barracks at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^While we were busy, a messenger was waiting out in the hall. I suppose he grew tired, or perhaps he simply ran away at the sight of Jules floating around the room. Either way, Force Commander Danath is looking for you. I suggest that you seek an audience with him inside the barracks as quickly as possible!Drill the Drillmaster^62^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^The Exorcism of Colonel Jules^^^Force Commander Danath Trollbane has ordered you to kill Drillmaster Zurok with all due haste. Return to the force commander at Honor Hold in the Hellfire Peninsula once the drillmaster is dead.^I'm receiving reports that the Shattered Hand fel orcs, out in front of Hellfire Citadel, are organizing for what looks like an all-out assault. No doubt, they're not happy about your successes against all of the clans. Get to the base of the citadel, where the Path of Glory ends. You'll find the fel orcs busy with their preparations, but you're going to catch them with their pants down. Eliminate the one that's in charge of that force. Kill Drillmaster Zurok!The Secret Compromised^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Seer Olum^Akama^^Akama's Promise^Ruse of the Ashtongue^Travel to the Warden's Cage in Shadowmoon Valley and speak to Akama.^Thanks again, <name>. I recognize your name. Akama has entrusted you with his plans and so I will trust you as well. The naga discovered I was working against Illidan and tried to get me to speak by torturing me. I did not tell them a thing - Akama himself taught me to master pain through meditation. Illidan asked the naga to bring me to him. He would have seen right through my flesh and into my soul's deepest secrets. Akama must be warned. Our plans are in jeopardy!Ruse of the Ashtongue^70^All^Tempest Keep^Akama^Akama^Ruse of the Ashtongue^The Secret Compromised^^Travel into Tempest Keep and slay Al'ar while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Return to Akama in Shadowmoon Valley once you've completed this task.^Olum's sacrifice was tremendous. I would never have asked him to give up his life myself. But it is done. If we're to lure Illidan back into a false sense of security, we need to do his bidding - at least for now. I command a vast army of Ashtongue, but - aside from the Deathsworn - none can be trusted. You are to perform the deed that Illidan demands. Take this cowl; it is magical in nature. You will appear to be one of my men to any who see you slaying Kael's phoenix, Al'ar.An Artifact From the Past^70^All^Hyjal Summit^Akama^Akama^Ruse of the Ashtongue^^^Go to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and gain access to the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Once inside, defeat Rage Winterchill and bring the Time-Phased Phylactery to Akama in Shadowmoon Valley.^Illidan's attention is now on Kael'thas, thanks to you. The time has come to make our move. I've had a vision of an artifact that will aid us in our final struggle - the phylactery of a lich known as Winterchill. Unfortunately its power was lost forever after his defeat in the Battle of Mount Hyjal. There might be a way to retrieve this artifact, however. Legend speaks of a place in Azeroth guarded by bronze dragons... a place where past and present meet. It is there you will find what we seek.The Hostage Soul^70^All^Shattrath City^Akama^A'dal^Ruse of the Ashtongue^^^Travel to Shattrath City to tell A'dal about Akama's request.^You might wonder why I go to such lengths to hide my intentions. Why not throw my lot in openly with the naaru? My very essence - my soul - is held prisoner inside the Black Temple. Illidan could destroy me any moment... until now! This phylactery will allow me to regain control of my soul. The time has come, <name>. I'll lead Maiev and my Deathsworn to Illidan's doorstep. Speak to A'dal and and tell him of our plan. If we strike together we'll break through Illidan's defenses.Entry Into the Black Temple^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^A'dal^Xi'ri^Ruse of the Ashtongue^^A Distraction for Akama^Travel to the entrance to the Black Temple in Shadowmoon Valley and speak to Xi'ri.^<A'dal shows you an image of a naaru outside of the Black Temple, fighting alongside draenei vindicators and blood elf magisters. You immediately understand that this is the distraction Akama is waiting for.>Morthis Whisperwing^70^All^Druid^Loganaar^Morthis Whisperwing^Morthis Whisperwing^^^Seek out Morthis Whisperwing at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Before all of the druidic orders coalesced into the Cenarion Circle, the Druids of the Talon were responsible for teaching promising young druids the mysteries of flight. With the dissolution of the order, former members teach the skill sparingly. Even now, Morthis Whisperwing continues his search for a suitable apprentice. Few druids have truly mastered all the forms available to them, but you show the promise Morthis requires of his students. Seek him out at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.Redemption of the Ashtongue^70^All^Ashtongue Deathsworn^Seer Kanai^Seer Kanai^A Distraction for Akama^^^Help Akama wrest control back of his soul by defeating the Shade of Akama inside the Black Temple. Return to Seer Kanai when you've completed this task.^When Illidan obtained the Broken's allegiance, Akama was our wisest. He knew that openly opposing the Betrayer would lead to the extinction of our race. Instead he has plotted and schemed for this very moment under utmost secrecy. Failure would be catastrophic... not just for Akama, not just for the Broken, but for all of Outland. No one this close to Illidan has ever been able to deliver such a terrible blow to him. Help Akama free his soul and he will grant you access to Illidan's sanctum.Seek Out the Ashtongue^70^All^Ashtongue Deathsworn^Xi'ri^Seer Kanai^A Distraction for Akama^^^Find Akama's Deathsworn inside the Black Temple.^<As you look up at Xi'ri, your mind becomes focused and your will determined. Your work here is not done; you must go inside the Black Temple and find Akama's followers.> <Much depends on Akama's success.>The Fall of the Betrayer^70^All^Ashtongue Deathsworn^Seer Kanai^Seer Kanai^A Distraction for Akama^^^Seer Kanai wants you to defeat Illidan inside the Black Temple.^With Illidan's lieutenants defeated, Akama will be able to force open the doors to Illidan's sanctum. Be ready to bring your force inside as soon as Akama does. We still do not know what has become of Maiev, but we must make our move without her. I hope your force is up to the task. Illidan will not be pleased to see Akama.The Ward of Wakening^70^All^Druid^Morthis Whisperwing^Morthis Whisperwing^Morthis Whisperwing^^Waking the Sleeper^Bring 10 Bogblossoms, 10 Ancient Lichen, and 10 Dreaming Glory to Morthis Whisperwing at the Cenarion Refuge.^Long ago, the relics used to teach the ways of the stormcrow were entrusted to an ancient druid. Your training requires these relics, so we must wake their guardian from his slumber. I will prepare a potion you can use to ease the process. The mixture requires common herbs, as well as bogblossom, which usually grows atop the tallest mushrooms in the marsh. Fly up there and pursue them but take care, as they're quite fragile and may explode violently if mishandled.Waking the Sleeper^70^All^Druid^Morthis Whisperwing^Clintar Dreamwalker^^The Ward of Wakening^No Mere Dream^Use the Ward of Waking to help Clintar Dreamwalker emerge from the Emerald Dream. When he is conscious, speak to him.^Take the ward with you and travel to Moonglade, to the Stormrage Barrow Dens. Within the southernmost of the Stormrage Barrow Dens, watched over by the dreamwardens, you will find Clintar Dreamwalker. Administer the potion and watch over him while he wakes. He'll be extremely vulnerable as his spirit reunites with his body and he certainly won't recognize you. Declare yourself to him as soon as he comes around, <name>. He will need your help to gather the relics for the ceremony.No Mere Dream^70^All^Druid^Clintar Dreamwalker^Dreamwarden Lurosa^No Mere Dream^Waking the Sleeper^^Protect Clintar Dreamwalker's Spirit while it gathers the relics of Aviana, then speak to Dreamwarden Lurosa.^<Clintar listens as you relay Morthis' instructions, nodding, but clearly fearful.> I cannot extricate myself fully from the Emerald Dream to help you, but a fragment of my spirit will guide you in your search for the relics. Guard it well, <race>, for it is a fragile thing. The Emerald Dream itself has become an alien, dangerous place. Its grasp on me is strong, and I will not be whole until the Emerald Dream returns to normalcy. What you see around you is but an echo of the reality inside the dream!Seek Out Ameer^70^All^Netherstorm^Protectorate Advisor Rahim^Commander Ameer^Seek Out Ameer^^^Seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post.^It would seem that an outside force has taken an interest in the business practices of the Consortium. Five Consortium dealers have gone missing in the past two days. We have reason to believe the Ethereum are involved. If you are interested in assisting, seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post. You will find the Protectorate Watch Post directly east of here on the next island.A Mission of Mercy^70^All^Netherstorm^Commander Ameer^Commander Ameer^Seek Out Ameer^^Ethereum Secrets^Recover the Salvaged Ethereum Prison Key for Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.^We salvaged this prison orb on our last scouting mission into Ethereum territory. We'd have never found it had it not been for the distress signal that it was faintly emitting. We think one of our own might be locked up in there but we have no way of opening the orb up without harming whatever is inside. What we know about the Ethereum is that any of their members could - at any given time - be carrying a key to unlock an orb. Retrieve one and return so that we may uncover the mysteries of this orb.Ethereum Secrets^70^All^Netherstorm^Commander Ameer^Commander Ameer^^A Mission of Mercy^Ethereum Prisoner I.D. Catalogue, A Thousand Worlds^Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him an Ethereum Prisoner I.D. Tag.^<Ameer holds up a tag.> I found this prisoner I.D. tag with the remains of the fallen vanguard. I can only assume that all of their prisoners are tagged in the same manner. I'm going to start cataloguing the tags in hopes of making sense of their penal system. If in your adventures you find more Ethereum prison keys, you can use them to open the Ethereum prisons at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - directly south of here. Bring me back any and all I.D. tags that you find.A Thousand Worlds^70^All^Netherstorm^Commander Ameer^Commander Ameer^A Thousand Worlds^Ethereum Secrets^^Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to bring him 5 Ethereum Prison Keys.^I have cracked the code! Each tag is broken up into several segments. The front side of the tag is always the same and states: "A Thousand Worlds..." I am unsure as to the meaning of this phrase but it sounds insidious. On the back side of the tag are the vital statistics. The first set of runes indicates location and the second indicates prisoner type. Furthermore, it would seem that the keys can be combined to form a special key that accesses another prison type. Now I just need more keys...Stasis Chambers of Bash'ir^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^A Thousand Worlds^^Purging the Chambers of Bash'ir, The Mark of the Nexus-King^Use the Ethereum Key Tablet - Alpha to open Stasis Chamber Alpha at Bash'ir's Landing in Blade's Edge Mountains.^The Ethereum have a settlement on the northernmost shelf of Blade's Edge Mountains known as Bash'ir's Landing. According to the key tablet, much larger versions of the prisons are kept at Bash'ir's. It should also be noted that the Ethereum refer to those prisons as stasis chambers. The key tablet grants access to a very specific stasis chamber at the landing known as Stasis Chamber Alpha. Take the key and investigate. My image will be awaiting your return at Bash'ir's Landing. Speak to me there.The Mark of the Nexus-King^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Mark of the Nexus-King^Stasis Chambers of Bash'ir^^The Image of Commander Ameer at Bash'ir's Landing in the Blade's Edge Mountains wants you to bring him a Mark of the Nexus-King.^What I must now know is what the Ethereum have held inside the Mana-Tombs of Auchindoun. In your battles against the beasts of the stasis chambers of Bash'ir you may run across an item known as the Mark of the Nexus-King. Should you find such an item, return it to me immediately! It is the final piece in crafting a key that will allow access to the stasis chamber inside the Mana-Tombs.Stasis Chambers of the Mana-Tombs^70^All^Mana-Tombs^Image of Commander Ameer^Image of Commander Ameer^The Mark of the Nexus-King^^Nexus-Prince Shaffar's Personal Chamber, The Eye of Haramad^The Image of Commander Ameer at Bash'ir's Landing in the Blade's Edge Mountains wants you to use the Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber Key on the Stasis Chamber inside the Mana-Tombs of Auchindoun.^The Mark of the Nexus-King that you recovered has allowed me to forge a new key for the stasis chambers found inside the Mana-Tombs. According to the glyphs on the mark, two exist: one near the front and one near Nexus-Prince Shaffar. This key that I am about to give you will open the stasis chamber near the front. I want you to go to the Mana-Tombs of Auchindoun and open the Mana-Tombs Stasis Chamber.Return to Morthis Whisperwing^70^All^Druid^Dreamwarden Lurosa^Morthis Whisperwing^No Mere Dream^^^Bring the Relics of Aviana to Morthis Whisperwing at Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.^Now that the relics have been recovered, you must leave this place with all haste. Clintar risked his safety and that of the dreamwardens to help you, <name>, but now he must fully devote his attention to fighting the force that has invaded the Emerald Dream. Take the relics back to Morthis Whisperwing, along with word of what you've seen here. He may be able to help us identify just what Clintar is struggling against.To the Evergrove^70^All^Druid^Morthis Whisperwing^Arthorn Windsong^No Mere Dream^^^Speak with Arthorn Windsong at the Evergrove in Blade's Edge Mountains.^Are you certain you saw a raven in the barrow den? This is a troubling development. There's little we can do to help Clintar and the dreamwardens directly, but if we can learn more about what's threatening the Emerald Dream, we may be able to stop it. We've been learning about the resurgence in an ancient arakkoa cult in Blade's Edge -- one that venerates a raven god. Go to the Evergrove and find Arthorn Windsong. There may be a connection between what's happening there and in the Emerald Dream!The Book of the Raven^70^All^Druid^Arthorn Windsong^Arthorn Windsong^No Mere Dream^^^Use an Aether Ray Eye with your Seer's Stone to reveal the raven cult ghosts. Search the Vortex Pinnacle for the spirit of Sai'kkal the Elder and question him about the book of the raven, then return to Arthorn Windsong.^From what you've told me, Morthis's suspicions seem plausible, but we need confirmation. In his research, Timeon has uncovered clues that a "book of the raven" served as an ancient scripture to the cult. The arakkoa spirits will not reveal themselves to your eyes. Take this stone with you to the high peaks in the western part of Blade's Edge, to the south of Raven's Wood, obtain an aether ray eye, and combine them to augment your sight. Search for the ghost Timeon identified as Sai'kkal the Elder.Mog'dorg the Wizened^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Grok^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Speak with the Ogre^^^Visit Mog'dorg the Wizened atop one of the towers just outside the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Mog'dorg wise! Him send Grok to city, look for help. Bloodmaul clan need help. Mog'dorg say, send powerful little ones to him at Blade's Edge Mountains. Him stand on tower at Circle of Blood. Mog'dorg wise!Speak with the Ogre^70^All^Shattrath City^V'eru^Grok^Speak with the Ogre^^^Speak with the Ogre, Grok, in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.^<V'eru's voice fills your mind with crystalline tone and clarity.> There is an ogre down in the Lower City, pleading for the assistance of passersby. They have all turned a deaf ear upon his plight. Do you think you might aid him? His name is Grok, and he is sitting near the merchants to the southeast. Thank you, <name>.A Distraction for Akama^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Xi'ri^Xi'ri^A Distraction for Akama^Entry Into the Black Temple^^Ensure that Akama and Maiev enter the Black Temple in Shadowmoon Valley after Xi'ri's forces create a distraction.^<Xi'ri pulses with lights as the Aldor and Scryer forces around him respond to his orders. Xi'ri's army is ready to push Illidan's forces back and create a distraction for Akama. The naaru awaits your request to begin the attack.>Eyes in the Sky^70^All^Druid^Arthorn Windsong^Watcher Elaira^No Mere Dream^^^Speak with Watcher Elaira at the Twilight Ridge in Nagrand.^Locating the pieces of the Book of the Raven, if they survive at all, is going to be difficult. Our best hope is to use a keener pair of eyes than your own. Down in western Nagrand, on the eastern lip of the Twilight Ridge, Watcher Elaira studies the various bird species that make their home there. Visit her and see if she can help you harness avian sight to gather the pieces of the Book of the Raven.To Catch A Sparrowhawk^70^All^Druid^Watcher Elaira^Watcher Elaira^No Mere Dream^^The Raven Stones^Use the Sparrowhawk Net to capture a Wild Sparrowhawk and bring it to Watcher Elaira on the Twilight Ridge.^The wild sparrowhawks of Nagrand have the keenest sight of all the predatory birds here. But, because of their size, they've been pushed out of most areas by the larger windrocs. Most of the sparrowhawks nest here, on the Twilight Ridge. If you can catch one, I'll train it to spot the pieces of your buried tablet. It's going to be difficult, though. The sparrowhawks are very skittish and will flee at your approach. I'd suggest cornering one or prowling to get close enough to cast your net.The Raven Stones^70^All^Druid^Watcher Elaira^Arthorn Windsong^^To Catch A Sparrowhawk^The Eagle's Essence^Gather 8 Raven Stones from Skettis and bring them to Arthorn Windsong at Evergrove in Blade's Edge Mountains.^I've trained your sparrowhawk to respond to a specific whistle. When it hears the sound, the bird will fly to you and guide you to the location of the nearest tablet fragment. Arthorn sent word that the fragments you're looking for are buried in the Skettis area of southeastern Terokkar Forest, so the bird will wait for you there. When you've gathered all the stones, return the whistle to Arthorn and she will see to the animal's care and release. Convey my greetings to Arthorn when you see her.Mog'dorg the Wizened^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chort^Mog'dorg the Wizened^^^^Speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower where Chort is standing, just outside the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Mog'dorg the Wizened waits for you at top of da tower. He tells me to look for a <race> <class> just like you. You go speak with him about smart things. Go now, but don't tell no one. It's a secret!The Eagle's Essence^70^All^Druid^Arthorn Windsong^Arthorn's Sparrowhawk^The Eagle's Essence^The Raven Stones^^Defeat the Guardian of the Eagle and obtain the Essence of the Eagle. Use Arthorn's Sparrowhawk Whistle to call Arthorn's Sparrowhawk to relay news of your success.^The Book of the Raven tells us the raven's followers captured and bound the spirits of his rivals within stone shrines. A guardian was set to watch over each, lest the raven's enemies attempt to free them. The first of the shrines is the eagle's, found in the hills to the south of Lake Jorune and west of Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest. The tablet says that the eagle fought valiantly, but was overcome by a swarm of enemies. The armor and endurance of your bear form is well-suited to this fight.The Falcon's Essence^70^All^Druid^Arthorn's Sparrowhawk^Arthorn's Sparrowhawk^The Eagle's Essence^^^Defeat the Guardian of the Falcon, obtain the Essence of the Falcon. Use Arthorn's Sparrowhawk Whistle to call Arthorn's Sparrowhawk to relay news of your success.^<The bird speaks with Arthorn's voice.> The second spirit bound by the raven's followers was the falcon. It was subdued and imprisoned close to Skettis as a reminder to the raven-priests when they held power. On the shores of Lake Ere'Noru, to the northwest of Skettis, you'll find the falcon's shrine. To overcome the falcon's guardian, you'll need to use the falcon's strengths to your advantage. Use the speed and grace of your cat form to defeat the guardian before it reaches full strength!The Hawk's Essence^70^All^Druid^Arthorn's Sparrowhawk^Arthorn Windsong^The Eagle's Essence^^^Defeat the Guardian of the Hawk and bring the Essence of the Hawk to Arthorn Windsong at the Evergrove.^<Arthorn's voice addresses you.> The last, and strongest, of the spirits spoken of in the Book of the Raven is that of the hawk. It was imprisoned far from Skettis, in a shrine on a remote island southeast of Auchindoun. I believe this description best matches the island we know as Sorrow Wing Point. The tablet describes the hawk's guardian as nearly invulnerable to the bird's claws. Forsake physical attacks and call down the fury of the stars to defeat this foe. Do not repeat the hawk's mistake.Return to Cenarion Refuge^70^All^Druid^Arthorn Windsong^Morthis Whisperwing^The Eagle's Essence^^^Bring Arthorn's Package to Morthis Whisperwing at Cenarion Refuge.^Bring the essences to Morthis Whisperwing, along with word of our findings about the raven god. Morthis will know best how to use the essences and information in drawing Anzu out into the open. Make your way to him quickly, for there's no telling how long Clintar and the dreamwardens can withstand the raven's assault! <Arthorn grabs your arm before you turn to leave>. Please, <name>, tell Morthis how much of a help I've been to you. I fear he will not see my hand in this work!Chasing the Moonstone^70^All^Druid^Morthis Whisperwing^Morthis Whisperwing^The Eagle's Essence^^^Bring a Southfury Moonstone to Morthis Whisperwing at the Cenarion Refuge.^If the essences are combined within a rare gemstone such as a Southfury moonstone, you'll be able to release them when you're prepared to challenge Anzu. The only problem is that Southfury moonstones are only found on the Azshara side of the river, on the cliffs near the river's source. Tragedy befell the last night elf party that sought the stone. Their boat is still anchored in the river near where they sighted the moonstone. Keep your eyes open and approach the site by land from the Azshara side.Grulloc Has Two Skulls^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Mog'dorg the Wizened^^^Grim(oire) Business^Collect Grulloc's Dragon Skull.^To the east, at the terminus of Dragons' End, is the Cursed Hollow. Therein, Grulloc, son of Gruul, plots his dimwitted schemes. I heard that one of his possessions was stolen from him through trickery. Was that you? Unfortunate that he was not slain in the process. If we are to regain our freedom, I would have you take his most prized possession, a dragon skull from when he rejoiced in his father's slaying of the black dragonflight. The only way you'll get the skull is to vanquish him.Maggoc's Treasure Chest^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Mog'dorg the Wizened^^^Grim(oire) Business^Collect Maggoc's Treasure Chest.^On the Razor Ridge, above and to the southeast, Maggoc patrols. His father assigned him as the warden of the eastern mountain range, and he revels in terrorizing any creature that gets in his way. As a son of Gruul, he must be done away with if my clan is to survive. That's where you come in. Maggoc carries a treasure chest with him at all times. Prove to me that he has been slain by bringing me his precious chest. Feel free to keep whatever you find within it.Even Gronn Have Standards^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Mog'dorg the Wizened^^^Grim(oire) Business^Collect Slaag's Standard.^Are you familiar with Shattrath City, <class>? Above it to the northwest is a place called the Barrier Hills, which you can only get to upon a flying mount. One of Gruul's sons, Slaag, exiled himself and took control of the Gordunni ogres that reside there. Even at such a distance, we cannot afford to leave him in peace, lest he return when the rest of his brothers have been slain. <name>, you must travel there, and bring back his standard as proof that he has been dealt with.Grim(oire) Business^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Grim(oire) Business^Grulloc Has Two Skulls, Maggoc's Treasure Chest, Even Gronn Have Standards^^Collect Vim'gol's Vile Grimoire.^There is one more gronn to be slain: Skulloc Soulgrinder. He keeps himself hidden away, but there is a way to coax him forth. He was trained by an ogre warlock known as Vim'gol the Vile, whose grimoire you must retrieve! Vim'gol must be summoned by standing within a fire ring at his circle. Find Vim'gol's Circle in the mountains, to the northeast, near the Broken Wilds. <name>, if you hear Vim'gol talk about growing bigger, get people back into each of the five fire rings to interrupt his casting!Into the Soulgrinder^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Grim(oire) Business^^Ogre Heaven, Speak with Mog'dorg^Collect Skulloc's Soul.^The grimoire is the key to Skulloc's downfall. Read aloud from the book at Soulgrinder's Barrow to initiate the ritual. An object known as the Soulgrinder will appear, as well as Skulloc's ghostly victims, who will try to destroy it. You must keep them from doing so long enough to force Skulloc fully into the world. Find the barrow by heading north through the Daggermaw Canyon on the other side of the Circle of Blood. It is on the right side before Gruul's Lair. Bring back Skulloc's soul.Vanquish the Raven God^70^All^Druid^Morthis Whisperwing^Morthis Whisperwing^The Eagle's Essence^^Eternal Vigilance^Slay the Raven God and return to Morthis Whisperwing at Cenarion Refuge.^We must waste no time in dealing with the raven god. You must take the essence-infused moonstone to a place of great power in order to lure the god from the relative safety of the Emerald Dream. Descend into the Sethekk Halls and set the moonstone in the clutches of the raven's claw. You'll find it in the chamber before the talon king's hall. Anzu must be made believe that his followers have gathered to welcome him back into the world. Once he has manifested, show him no mercy!The Fall of Magtheridon^70^Alliance^Hellfire Peninsula^Magtheridon's Head^Force Commander Danath Trollbane^^^^Return Magtheridon's Head to Force Commander Danath Trollbane at Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^The source of Illidan Stormrage's fel orc army has been vanquished. The manufactory halts production of its grim product - at least for now. All that remains are a few trinkets and this severed head - a fitting trophy for a hero of the Alliance. Return Magtheridon's head to Danath Trollbane at Honor Hold.The Fall of Magtheridon^70^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Magtheridon's Head^Nazgrel^^^^Return Magtheridon's Head to Nazgrel at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.^The source of Illidan Stormrage's fel orc army has been vanquished. The manufactory halts production of its grim product - at least for now. All that remains are a few trinkets and this severed head - a fitting trophy for a hero of the Horde. Return Magtheridon's head to Nazgrel at Thrallmar.World of Shadows^70^All^Skettis^Severin^Severin^^^Secrets of the Talonpriests, More Shadow Dust^Severin wants you to venture into Skettis and retrieve 6 Shadow Dusts from the arakkoa that dwell there.^Sky Commander Adaris was seriously injured during a Skettis incursion. He's been in and out of consciousness since. I fear he has succumbed to a feverish delirium. During brief lucid moments he demands that I prepare an elixir made from shadow dust carried by the arakkoa. He seems to believe it will allow him to see into a "world of shadows" where the arakkoa's true leaders dwell. I do not believe this nonsense for a second, but I fear he won't rest until I obtain such an elixir. Will you help?Secrets of the Talonpriests^70^All^Skettis^Sky Commander Adaris^Sky Commander Adaris^^World of Shadows^^Obtain an Elixir of Shadows from Severin and use it to find and slay Talonpriest Ishaal, Talonpriest Skizzik and Talonpriest Zellek in Skettis. Return to Commander Adaris after completing this task.^Thank you for paying heed to my fevered rants. All along we had been trying to identify and destroy the Skettis chain of command; we had learned of three clerics known as the talonpriests, but we'd never seen them with our own two eyes. Now we know why. Talk to Severin to obtain more of the elixir he discovered. Use the elixir to find and kill the three talonpriests: Ishaal, Skizzik and Zellek. They're rumored to dwell in Veil Ala'rak, near the eastern shore of Blackwind Lake.Kael'thas and the Verdant Sphere^70^All^Tempest Keep^Verdant Sphere^A'dal^^^^Take the Verdant Sphere to A'dal in Shattrath City.^The air around you hums - a gentle hum. The naaru are aware of your victory. Perhaps they are the reason you were compelled to pick up this sphere from the still-twitching remains of Kael'thas Sunstrider. What secrets could it hold? Perhaps A'dal in Shattrath City could make sense of the item.Fires Over Skettis^70^All^Skettis^Sky Sergeant Doryn^Sky Sergeant Doryn^^To Skettis!^^Seek out Monstrous Kaliri Eggs on the tops of Skettis dwellings and use the Skyguard Blasting Charges on them. Return to Sky Sergeant Doryn.^You think you have what it takes to be part of the Skyguard? We'll have to see how you handle yerself in the air. The arakkoa are breeding a gargantuan variety of their attack pets and are using it against our scouts. I want you to take these blasting charges and use them to destroy hatcheries above the arakkoa's dwellings. Avoid the monstrous kaliri guarding the hatcheries. They'll knock you off your mount before you know what hit you.Ogre Heaven^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Chu'a'lor^Speak with Mog'dorg^Into the Soulgrinder^^Speak with Chu'a'lor at Ogri'la in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Now that you have delivered us from bondage, we can begin the process of reunifying the clans. This will take some time; old grudges are difficult to overcome. But more pressing, you must go to Ogri'la in the heavens above to the west. You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: ethereals, demons, and worst of all, the black dragonflight. When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed.Bombing Run^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Sky Sergeant Vanderlip^Sky Sergeant Vanderlip^Bombing Run^Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger, An Apexis Relic^Bomb Them Again!^Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.^You have a flying mount... so what! You think you have what it takes to use it properly? Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la. With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business. You want to prove yourself? Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks. Just don't let them shoot you down, too!Eternal Vigilance^70^All^Druid^Morthis Whisperwing^Morthis Whisperwing^^Vanquish the Raven God^^Speak with Morthis Whisperwing to receive an Essence-Infused Moonstone.^Your defeat of Anzu, the raven god, is truly a remarkable accomplishment. He may not abandon his quest to return to Outland, I fear. As long as he has followers here, he will attempt to rise again. Keep the essence-infused moonstone with you in case we have not heard the last of Anzu.In Service of the Illidari^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Mordenai^Overlord Mor'ghor^In Service of the Illidari^Blood Oath of the Netherwing^^Travel to Netherwing Ledge and deliver the Illidari Service Papers to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp.^Netherwing Ledge... What was once a bastion of sanctuary for the Netherwing is now home to the Dragonmaw. While the orcs may have control of our territory, our magic there is still strong. Strong enough to cloak your true identity and allow you to infiltrate the ranks of Dragonmaw. I have prepared this letter for you to present to their leader, Overlord Mor'ghor. Fly headlong into the maw of our enemy and seek out Dragonmaw Base Camp to start your new life as a fel orc of Illidan Stormrage.Enter the Taskmaster^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Mor'ghor^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^In Service of the Illidari^^Netherwing Crystals, Nethermine Flayer Hide, Netherdust Pollen, Nethercite Ore, Your Friend On The Inside, A Job Unfinished...^Speak with Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp.^<Mor'ghor crumples up the service letter and tosses it aside.> Alright grunt, first things first. If you're gonna join my beloved Dragonmaw army, you'll need to work. Everyone works up here on the ledge. Get a job and don't screw it up and I'll see if there might be something more interesting for you to do later. Go talk to Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath. He's standin' in the middle of town. He'll assess your skills and assign work as he sees fit. Now get out of my face!Netherwing Crystals^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^^Enter the Taskmaster^^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 30 Netherwing Crystals.^No good at nothin'? That's fine. Even lunkheads like you can be used around here. Just find creatures on the ledge and kill 'em. Sometimes they'll have nether crystals on their carcasses. Gather those and bring 'em back to me and I'll consider your work order for the day complete.Nethermine Flayer Hide^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^^Enter the Taskmaster^^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 35 Nethermine Flayer Hides.^A skinner, eh? Well you'll find plenty to skin here! You gotta search for flayers around crystal formations. Take 'em down and take their hides. Sometimes they'll have a hide worth keepin'. Bring those to me.Netherdust Pollen^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^^Enter the Taskmaster^^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 40 Netherdust Pollen.^A flower picker?! Hilarious... Unfortunately, our mages and shaman need your services. The netherdust bushes that grow on this ledge have special pollen that is apparently very useful in their magical dealings. Bring me that stuff and I'll consider your work order complete.Nethercite Ore^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^^Enter the Taskmaster^^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 40 Nethercite Ore.^A miner! <Varkule salutes.> An orc after my own heart! That's how Varkule got his start - minin'! There ain't nothin' better than getting down and dirty in the mines, is there? Now get out there and find those nethercite deposits. Strip 'em for all their worth and bring me back the ore.A Slow Death^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Yarzill the Merc^Yarzill the Merc^^Your Friend On The Inside^^Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to use Yarzill's Mutton in conjunction with Fel Glands to poison 12 Dragonmaw Peon Camps.^The Dragonmaw have peons stationed at nearly every crystal formation up here. While the outright slaying of them would draw far too much unwanted attention to you, there is a way that we can thin their numbers and remain below the suspicious eyes of Mor'ghor. Venture into the wilds of Shadowmoon Valley and slay the tainted wildlife. Take from them their corrupt fel glands. Use those fel glands with this mutton that I'll give you near the peons. They'll take one bite and fall deathly ill!Ishaal's Almanac^70^All^Skettis^Ishaal's Almanac^Sky Commander Adaris^Ishaal's Almanac^^^Bring Ishaal's Almanac to Sky Commander Adaris north of Skettis.^This mysterious tome was on Talonpriest Ishaal's body. It contains arcane symbols and charts of celestial bodies beyond your comprehension. All writing is in a language you don't understand; likely an ancient version of the arakkoa written tongue. Perhaps you should bring this to Sky Commander Adaris.Speak with Mog'dorg^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Bladespire Supplicant^Mog'dorg the Wizened^Speak with Mog'dorg^Into the Soulgrinder^^Speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened. He stands atop the tower on the east side of the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^<King /Queen> <name>! You speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened before you leave and go to Ogri'la!Bomb Them Again!^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Sky Sergeant Vanderlip^Sky Sergeant Vanderlip^Bombing Run^^^Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.^We're still having problems with those flak cannons, <name>. Don't get me wrong -- I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out -- but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out. And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la. What do you say? Want to take another shot at it?An Ally in Lower City^70^All^Shattrath City^Sky Commander Adaris^Rilak the Redeemed^Ishaal's Almanac^^^Bring Ishaal's Almanac to Rilak the Redeemed in the Lower City section of Shattrath City.^There is an arakkoa in Lower City by the name of Rilak... He can be trusted. Take the book... to him. <Adaris drifts into unconsciousness as he returns the book to you.>The Crystals^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Chu'a'lor^The Crystals^^Guardian of the Monument, Wrangle Some Aether Rays!^Collect 5 Apexis Shards.^When prepared correctly, the crystals of the mountains exhibit strange powers, such as the clarity of mind that we have found here in Ogri'la. All of the creatures atop the mountains covet the crystal shards and use them to further their own goals. An economy has even sprung up around them. To assist us, you must first learn about the Apexis shards. Bring me some. In addition to the creatures here having them, they can sometimes be found where the flayers dig at the larger crystals.Banish the Demons^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Kronk^Kronk^^^Banish More Demons^Use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at Forge Camp: Wrath or Forge Camp: Terror.^You've arrived at the perfect time, friend! We are in need of assistance. In return, you will receive something very rare, which will help us both in the end. We're not a violent ogre any longer, but the demons nearby threaten to overrun us and the Skyguard. The problem with demons is that, once killed, they come right back in new bodies! But, if you use this crystal to summon a banishing portal, when they die near it, their essences will be drawn in and banished back from whence they came!Countdown to Doom^70^All^Skettis^Rilak the Redeemed^Sky Commander Adaris^Ishaal's Almanac^^Hazzik's Bargain^Return to Sky Commander Adaris at Blackwind Landing in Terokkar Forest with the news about Terokk's return.^This almanac presages the return of Terokk, the most powerful and terrible Skettis king in arakkoa history. I always believed this to be the mere legend, <name>. The return of the talonpriests and your recovery of this tome indicate otherwise. With each day, Terokk comes closer to returning to full strength. Your only chance is to bring him to our world prematurely. Return to Skettis and speak to Adaris about this. Let us hope he has the wisdom to do the right thing.A Shabby Disguise^70^All^Skettis^Hazzik^Hazzik^Hazzik's Bargain^^Adversarial Blood^Use the Shabby Arakkoa Disguise to obtain the Adversarial Bloodlines from Sahaak and return to Hazzik.^Open the package, <name>. It is a disguise. It doesn't look very convincing, does it? I craft them for ethereal smugglers in search of rare books. There is an arakkoa scribe who dwells in the central island in Skettis, Terokk's Rest; his name is Sahaak. He is old and nearly blind. Use the disguise to speak with him and obtain the book known as the Adversarial Bloodlines. Be careful, <name>. The disguise won't fool the other arakkoa.Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Torkus^Torkus^Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger^^Bombing Run, The Skyguard Outpost^Collect an Unstable Flask of the Beast.^<class>, we've got a problem -- we have lots of sons. And ever since the Skyguard moved in nearby, all our sons ever talk about is joining their ranks. As a proud father, we want them to have every advantage for when they apply. So, would you go to the fel crystalforge at either forge camp to the north or south, and procure a magic flask for our sons? You can't miss their green smoke. We think that they take ten apexis shards to make. We'd give you the shards, but we don't have any at the moment.The Not-So-Friendly Skies...^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Yarzill the Merc^Yarzill the Merc^^Your Friend On The Inside^^Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 10 Netherwing Relics.^On the northeast edge of this island exists a dock used for the packaging and transport of Netherwing crystals and relics. Dragonmaw Transporters transport the goods from the dock to Dragonmaw Fortress while Dragonmaw Ascendants guard the ground from any would-be attackers. This leaves one opening for you to make a strike at the Dragonmaw: The Dragonmaw Skyway. Fly to the shattered islands of the Dragonmaw Skyway and ambush the transporters that use the route. Recover our stolen relics!Out of This World Produce!^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Old Orok^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Out of This World Produce!^^^Bring the Preserved Fruit to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^I'll be the first to admit I'm not quite sure what this order is for, but Rocket-Chief Fuselage's instructions were very specific -- only the very best fruit, preserved to survive a long voyage and sealed against the elements. There were other specifications, zero-gravity this and low pressure that. I don't pretend to understand it, but the price is right, so he'll get his superfood. Bring this crate to him up at Area 52. After crossing into Netherstorm, keep following the road until you see the town.A Strange Vision^67^Horde^Nagrand^Seer Nakha^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^A Strange Vision^^^Speak with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52.^I've had a most unusual vision, <name>, and I don't know quite what to make of it. I've seen an arrow, an immense arrow, riding into the sky on a trail of fire. Such a feat is trivial for a skilled mage, but somehow I know the arrow I saw is not the product of magic. It will be unlike anything the people of Azeroth have ever achieved. You must seek out the people working on this, <name>. Lend them your help, for without it, their efforts may yet fail.Assist Exarch Orelis^67^All^Shattrath City^Vindicator Aeus^Exarch Orelis^Assist Exarch Orelis^^^Speak with Exarch Orelis at Area 52.^Not long ago, High Priestess Ishanah sent a small group of anchorites to Netherstorm, under the command of Exarch Orelis. They were to investigate the activities of Kael'thas and his minions, but we haven't received any reports of their findings yet. I worry that our presence in the area might not be strong enough to carry out the mission. I'm certain that the exarch could benefit from your knowledge and experience. Are you willing to travel to Area 52 and assist him?Report to Spymaster Thalodien^67^All^Shattrath City^Arcanist Savan^Spymaster Thalodien^Report to Spymaster Thalodien^^^Report to Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52.^Some time ago, Voren'thal dispatched a small team to Netherstorm to investigate the activities of Kael'thas. Our leader has the utmost confidence in Spymaster Thalodien and his compatriots, and has decided to honor his request for reinforcements. Thalodien's report was brief, but clear that he's encountered something of great importance. Report to him at Area 52 and assist him in any way possible, <name>.Parts for the Rocket-Chief^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Bossi Pentapiston^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^Parts for the Rocket-Chief^^^Bring Bossi's Spare Parts to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.^You can count on one hand the number of times I've collaborated with a goblin. We're far more likely to be in competition with them, but when I received Rocket-Chief Fuselage's request, I just couldn't refuse him. This crate is full of parts I'm not using here, but that the rocket-chief might be able to put to use on his project. Would you be kind enough to deliver them if you're on your way to Area 52? Who knows, maybe some fine gnomish parts could keep his creation from exploding!A Job Unfinished...^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Partially Digested Hand^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Enter the Taskmaster^^Slay 10 Overmine Flayers and Barash the Den Mother. Return to Overlord Mor'ghor at the Dragonmaw Base Camp should you succeed.^In the name of our great master... For the glory of Illidan! By order of Overlord Mor'ghor, the great plateau of Netherwing Ledge is to be secured. With all Netherwing drakes captured or forced off of the land, rock flayers are running rampant and threatening crystal harvesting operations. Destroy them all, their den mother and her consort, Arvoar. Mor'ghor commands it! <It would appear that this orc failed to take the plateau. It is time to prove your worth to Mor'ghor!>A Mystifying Vision^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Seer Jovar^Rocket-Chief Fuselage^A Mystifying Vision^^^Speak with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52.^A strange vision haunts me, <name>. I see a continuous cloud of smoke ascending toward the sky, left in the wake of a giant fire moving ever faster away. It is not a natural phenomenon, nor a creation of evil; that much I know. I have no knowledge of what it looks like, save that it is the product of the labor of many. Yet, without more hands, it may never come to be. Travel to Netherstorm, <class>. Locate those responsible for this creation and offer them your aid.Building a Better Gryphon^67^Alliance^Blade's Edge Mountains^Rip Pedalslam^Brunn Flamebeard^^^^Speak with Brunn Flamebeard at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley.^I've heard that the Wildhammer dwarves maintain a gryphon roost at their fortress down in southern Shadowmoon Valley. If you're going down there, would you speak to them on my behalf? I have some ideas on how to improve their gryphons! Why stop at armoring them when you could attach an altimeter, a rear view mirror, and rocket? Imagine how fast you could go with one of those babies strapped to your gryphon's back! I'll call it the TurboGryphon 8000!Visions of Destruction^67^Alliance^Nagrand^Seer Jovar^Wing Commander Nuainn^Visions of Destruction^^^Speak with Wing Commander Nuainn at Wildhammer Stronghold.^A vision of cataclysm often disturbs my rest -- a rain of green fire falling to the earth, felling the valiant defenders of a mighty fortress. It has haunted me for weeks now, although I have only recently come to understand its meaning. To the far east, in Shadowmoon Valley, the Wildhammer dwarves endure constant attacks from the Burning Legion and numerous other foes. They fight bravely, but without relief, their enemies will triumph. Go to their side, <name>. Help them in their fight.Zorus the Judicator^67^Alliance^Shattrath City^Fantei^Zorus the Judicator^Zorus the Judicator^^^Speak with Zorus the Judicator at Wildhammer Stronghold.^The history of Shadowmoon Valley is a long and troubled one. Few delve into it for fear of breathing new life into the unspeakable atrocities that took place there. Not all are so timid, though. Zorus the Judicator searches for the truth about the ghosts of Shadowmoon's past. It is a staggering undertaking, one with which he would welcome help, I'm sure. If you should venture into the valley, look for Zorus at Wildhammer Stronghold, in the central portion of the valley's southern region.Chief Apothecary Hildagard^67^Horde^Shattrath City^Fantei^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^Chief Apothecary Hildagard^^^Speak with Chief Apothecary Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village.^The history of Shadowmoon Valley is a long and troubled one. Few study it for fear of breathing new life into the unspeakable atrocities that took place there. Not all are so timid, though. Chief Apothecary Hildagard's research delves into the ghosts of Shadowmoon's past. It is a staggering undertaking, one with which she would welcome help, I'm sure. If your travels bring you there, seek Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village, in the northwestern reaches of the valley.The Apprentice's Request^67^Horde^Blade's Edge Mountains^Agadai^Dama Wildmane^^^^Speak with Dama Wildmane at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley.^As an apprentice wind rider master, one of my tasks is to care for the beasts when they're not flying. The problem is that we have so few here, there's very little downtime for any of them. I'm afraid we'll work them all to death if we don't receive any replacements. There's a large stable down in Shadowmoon Village, in western Shadowmoon Valley. Dama Wildmane oversees the wind rider care and training there. Would you speak with her on our behalf and let her know about our situation?Kroghan's Report^67^Horde^Nagrand^Captain Kroghan^Blood Guard Gulmok^Kroghan's Report^^^Speak with Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.^My original orders were to remain in Garadar for a short time, then continue on and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. What I've seen in my time here is that Garadar could benefit from a long term Horde liaison. I know that Blood Guard Gulmok needs all the troops he can get, but I know he'll understand that my mission here isn't yet complete. Travel to Shadowmoon Village, in northwestern Shadowmoon Valley, and inform Blood Guard Gulmok of my delayed arrival.The Great Netherwing Egg Hunt^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Yarzill the Merc^Yarzill the Merc^^Your Friend On The Inside^Accepting All Eggs^Yarzill the Merc at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover a Netherwing Egg.^Should you discover any Netherwing eggs while exploring, bring them to me. Be warned, a Netherwing egg is a rare discovery. Do not become frustrated if you cannot locate one. These Dragonmaw have been very thorough in collecting most of them and shipping them off to parts unknown. Eggs might be found on creatures of the island, near crystal formations, in the mines, or even inside a nethercite node or netherdust bush. Keep a low profile. We don't need Mor'ghor catching wind of your actions.Banish More Demons^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Kronk^Kronk^^Banish the Demons^^Use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at Forge Camp: Wrath or Forge Camp: Terror.^If we know the demons, and we do because we've studied them extensively, they're fast at work repairing any damage that has been done to their precious transporter. So, if you want a chance at another darkrune, take our banishing crystal back out there and eliminate more demons. Besides, you want to help us to lessen the threat that the demons pose, yes? We said "chance" because the process we use yields mixed results. You might get a darkrune, or you might get something else entirely.Rise, Overseer!^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Your Friend On The Inside^Overseeing and You: Making the Right Cho, The Netherwing Mines, Stand Tall, Captain!^Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Rare it is that a peon survives for as long as you have. Rarer still is when a peon rises from the dregs to attain a new rank. <Varkule claps.> The Overlord has called for you, grunt. A new rank awaits, no doubt.Overseeing and You: Making the Right Choices^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Chief Overseer Mudlump^Chief Overseer Mudlump^Overseeing and You: Making the Right Choices^Rise, Overseer!^^Chief Overseer Mudlump at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 10 pieces of Knothide Leather and 1 Hardened Hide of Tyrantus.^So you're the new overseer, eh? Well there's one thing any good overseer needs and that's the proper disciplinary weapon. Before you can go out there and knock some sense into these peons you need to have your "piece." Each overseer has to gather the materials required to make their own "piece" and you'll be no different. I'll need knothide leather and the hardened hide of Tyrantus. You'll find Tyrantus in Eco-Dome Farfield, located in the northern reaches of Netherstorm.The Booterang: A Cure For The Common Worthless Peon^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Chief Overseer Mudlump^Chief Overseer Mudlump^Overseeing and You: Making the Right Cho^^^Chief Overseer Mudlump at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to discipline 20 lazy Dragonmaw Peons. You will also need to return your Booterang.^This is your booterang. There are many like it but this one is yours. As an overseer you will use this booterang to sow terror into the hearts of defiant peons. Proper use of the booterang will instill obedience and ensure subservience. Venture forth to the crystal fields and discipline any peons that you see slacking off. Show them the might of the booterang!Hazzik's Bargain^70^All^Skettis^Hazzik^Hazzik^Hazzik's Bargain^Countdown to Doom^^Obtain Hazzik's Package at his dwelling in eastern Skettis and return to him with it.^Do not draw attention to our conversation. Adaris would not approve. I belong to the lowest caste of arakkoa, <name>. During Terokk's rule I would've been sacrificed to the dark powers worshipped by his talonpriests. If what you say is true and the talonpriests are seeking Terokk's return, then you must prevent them from succeeding - regardless of what your leader says! I've something to offer you that you'll find useful. There is a package at my old dwelling in Upper Veil Shil'ak. Bring it to me!The Trouble Below^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Mog'dorg the Wizened^^^^Speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened atop one of the towers just outside the Circle of Blood in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^We commend your zeal in wanting to help out here in Ogri'la, <class>. However, we have a favor to ask of you before we can accept your assistance. Down below our brethren are enslaved to the Sons of Gruul. Please, speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened, who is leading an ogre resistance against their gronn masters. Seek him out atop the tower on the eastern side of the Circle of Blood arena.An Apexis Relic^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Chu'a'lor^The Crystals^^Bombing Run^Gain Apexis Vibrations from an Apexis Relic.^Long ago a now-extinct sect of the arakkoa known as the Apexis lived here. Remnants of their civilization are still present. We call them apexis relics. What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon. Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last. An apexis shard is needed to power the relic. Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration.Guardian of the Monument^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Chu'a'lor^^The Crystals^^Collect an Apexis Guardian's Head.^You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround. These larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take many more apexis shards to activate and require four persons to operate. Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use. These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la. We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof.A Father's Duty^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Torkus^Torkus^Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger^^A Fel Whip For Gahk^Collect an Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer for him.^As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: Bash'ir Landing. It's an ethereal base, and they aren't too friendly with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain. Where's Bash'ir Landing, you ask? Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past Forge Camp: Wrath, you'll eventually spot it. The Bash'ir crystalforge itself is at the northeast corner of the landing. Thank you for doing this, <name>. It'll mean the world to our sons!The Skyguard Outpost^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Sky Commander Keller^^Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger^^Speak with Sky Commander Keller at the Skyguard Outpost in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^<name>, we were wondering if you might be willing to visit our friends just to the north at the Skyguard Outpost? Sky Commander Keller and his Skyguard are here running missions for our mutual protection, and he's asked us to send along anyone that we feel would excel at helping out. That would be you! Head up there as soon as you can, and please, give him our regards.Dragonmaw Race: The Ballad of Oldie McOld^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Murg "Oldie" Muckjaw^Ja'y Nosliw^^Earning Your Wings...^Dragonmaw Race: Trope the Filth-Belcher^Follow Murg "Oldie" Muckjaw while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Murg "Oldie" Muckjaw, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Don't let the gray hair fool you, grunt. I'm still ten times the rider that you are! And don't go thinking that this old dog doesn't have any tricks up his sleeve. Now all you gotta do is follow me and try not to get knocked down off your mount. If you can do that, Oldie will admit defeat. We'll lift off as soon as you're ready.Wrangle Some Aether Rays!^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Skyguard Khatie^Skyguard Khatie^Wrangle Some Aether Rays!^The Crystals^To Rule The Skies^Use the Wrangling Rope to capture 5 Aether Rays.^Wanna help the Skyguard and Ogri'la? Just hear me out before you walk away, <hot stuff /girly>. We're in need of remounts! The bombing runs and missions to Bash'ir Landing have taken a toll on our mounts. The aether rays that fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast, look like they'd do just fine. You don't even have to bring them back here, though that would be nice. Just break and rope them, and we'll track them down later. Think you can wrangle me up some?Wrangle More Aether Rays!^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Skyguard Khatie^Skyguard Khatie^Wrangle Some Aether Rays!^^^Use the Wrangling Rope to capture 5 Aether Rays.^So, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays! From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope! And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect Ogri'la, which the ogres appreciate. Remember, the aether rays fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast. Think you can wrangle me up some more?Dragonmaw Race: Trope the Filth-Belcher^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Trope the Filth-Belcher^Ja'y Nosliw^^Dragonmaw Race: The Ballad of Oldie McOl^Dragonmaw Race: Corlok the Vet^Follow Trope the Filth-Belcher while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Trope the Filth-Belcher, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Dragonmaw treat you right, <name>. Even a worn out cursed being like me is given a chance. Now if you want to prove your worth to the Skybreakers, you will have to defeat me. I'm going to shake you off my tail like a bad case of fleas... We'll lift off when you are ready.Dragonmaw Race: Corlok the Vet^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Corlok the Vet^Ja'y Nosliw^^Dragonmaw Race: Trope the Filth-Belcher^Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Ichman^Follow Corlok the Vet while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Corlok the Vet, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^You are challenging ME? Don't make me laugh! You're serious? Very well then! All you need to do is not die. You can manage to not die, right?? Even if I'm hurling skulls at you and flying circles around your pathetic riding skills? Just let me know when you're ready and we'll lift off.Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Ichman^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Ichman^Ja'y Nosliw^^Dragonmaw Race: Corlok the Vet^Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Mulverick^Follow Wing Commander Ichman while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Wing Commander Ichman, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Three years I spent in that hell hole. Three years a prisoner of war to the damnable Frostwolf Clan. Made to sit in their tower and listen to them endlessly whine about the bridge to Dun Baldar. About how it's "unfair" that blah, blah, blah, blah... War isn't fair! To hell with 'em all! The minute I was freed I left that place forever and came here to start a new life. Now Mulv and I are vying for the top orc spot. If you want it, you're gonna have to go through me, scrub. We go when you're ready.Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Mulverick^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Wing Commander Mulverick^Ja'y Nosliw^^Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Ichman^Dragonmaw Race: Captain Skyshatter^Follow Wing Commander Mulverick while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Wing Commander Mulverick, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Three years of blood, sweat and tears. Mostly tears... The amount of crying that a hardened soldier does when it comes down to all-out war is amazing! "They're jumping into our tower with their horses!" "Why is their base so well defended?" "They're taking our relief hut, I'm going A.W.O.L.!" Wimps... I took the first train out of "cry-town" the minute the Dark Portal opened. Now I'm a top gun for the Dragonmaw. If you want to be top orc, you'll have to defeat me. We go when you are ready.Dragonmaw Race: Captain Skyshatter^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Captain Skyshatter^Ja'y Nosliw^^Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Mulverick^^Follow Captain Skyshatter while attempting to stay on your flying mount. Should you defeat Captain Skyshatter, report your victory to Ja'y Nosliw at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^You dare challenge Skyshatter? The world around you will fall into darkness as the heavens are torn asunder by my meteors. You stand no chance, soldier. Yet it is your desire to die... I will entertain this morbid obsession if only to prove a point to any that might foolishly dream of making the same mistake. We ride when you are ready!Terokk's Downfall^70^All^Skettis^Sky Commander Adaris^Sky Commander Adaris^^Adversarial Blood^^Take the Time-Lost Offering prepared by Hazzik to the Skull Pile at the center of Skettis and summon and defeat Terokk. Return to Sky Commander Adaris when you've completed this task.^I... I've turned a blind eye to your dealings with the arakkoa prisoner, <name>. It looks like your instincts to cooperate with him were right. You must understand... I would've faced a mutiny in my current state if I endorsed your efforts to bring Terokk to this world. Take the items that Hazzik prepared for you and go ahead with your plan. I will command my men to back you up when the time comes. I recommend that you bring a force of your own as well. I fear you'll only get one chance at this.Tokens of the Descendants^70^All^Terokkar Forest^Hazzik^Hazzik^^Adversarial Blood^^Collect Time-Lost Scrolls from the time-lost arakkoa in Skettis and bring them to a Skull Pile inside a summoning circle in Skettis. Summon and defeat the descendants of Terokk's adversaries and return to Hakkiz with Akkarai's Talon, Garokk's Spine, Vekkaz's Scale and Gezzarak's Claw.^The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book. Gezzarak the Huntress, Garokk the Crystal Giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vekkaz the Windrager. They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world. You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa and burn them at the summoning circles all over Skettis. Bring me a token from each one. These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends.The Netherwing Mines^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Mistress of the Mines^The Netherwing Mines^Rise, Overseer!^Dragons are the Least of Our Problems, The Great Murkblood Revolt, Crazed and Confused^Seek out the Mistress of the Mines on Netherwing Ledge.^Your help is required at the Netherwing Mines, overseer <name>. Two days ago our mining operations came to a grinding halt when we made a grim discovery. A miner was working in the depths of the mine and struck his pick upon an unusual crystal formation. Unfortunately, this crystal formation was attached to a very angry nether dragon. The beast woke from its slumber and annihilated all of our workers. Report to the Mistress of the Mines. They await you at the mouth of the mines, southwest of here.Picking Up The Pieces...^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Mistress of the Mines^Mistress of the Mines^The Netherwing Mines^^^The Mistress of the Mines at the Netherwing Mines in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to recover 15 Nethermine Cargo crates.^Much of our hard work lies scattered about in these mines. Carts full of cargo are littered across every inch of this mine! We just can't get to any of it with the current infestation. That's where you come in, <name>. Your daily duty here at this mine is to collect the cargo left behind by the miners and deep mine workers. Gather the nethermine cargo and return it to me or my sister.Dragons are the Least of Our Problems^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Dragonmaw Foreman^Dragonmaw Foreman^^The Netherwing Mines^^The Dragonmaw Foreman at the Netherwing Mines in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill 15 Nethermine Flayers and 5 Nethermine Ravagers.^That dragon waking up riled up a host of other nasty creatures in these mines. Two types are proving to be a thorn in the side of the Dragonmaw: Nethermine flayers and Nethermine ravagers. You must help us by killing them off. All I ask is your involvement once per day. Get in there and kill as many as you can!To Rule The Skies^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Sky Commander Keller^Sky Commander Keller^^^^Collect Dragon Teeth.^As ye've flown around, ye must have noticed the dragons above. I trust ye haven't fallen victim ta their rage. Help us put an end ta it, <name>! Rivendark and Obsidia lord over this terrace, while Insidion and Furywing rule the skies over yon terrace ta the northeast. Each has a perch on their respective domains. I be wondering if ye and yer friends will go ta one, <lad /lass>, break open an egg and attract the dragon down. Bring me some teeth as proof. Ta rule the skies, it's either them or us.A Fel Whip For Gahk^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Gahk^Gahk^^A Father's Duty^^Collect a Fel Whip.^Gahk think being smart is dumb sometimes. Gahk not want to think. Me want little <race> to smash big demons! Dey have some chiefs, and da chiefs all have whips to hurt da little demons. You bring Gahk a whip! You challenge demon chief in forge camps at burning, green, fel crystal prism. Use many apexis shards to get dem to come. Dey called Galvanoth, Braxxus, Zarcsin and da Mo'arg Incinerator.The Relic's Emanation^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Chu'a'lor^The Crystals^^^Gain Apexis Emanations from an Apexis Relic.^Now that you have felt the enlightening vibrations of the apexis relics, it is time for you to further your understanding of their workings. We are very eager to benefit from your observations! As you progress in your ability to attune to the relics, you will gain a higher level of knowledge. This recognition will come in the form of an emanation from the relic. Return to us when you have attained such an emanation.The Great Murkblood Revolt^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Murkblood Escape Plans^Mistress of the Mines^The Great Murkblood Revolt^The Netherwing Mines^^Take the Murkblood Escape Plans to the Mistress of the Mines.^This document outlines a revolt planned by the Murkblood broken. It seems that the dragon was to be used as a diversion to draw attention away from their escape. Looking at all of the corpses littering the mine, it would be safe to assume that their plans failed. Return the escape plans to the Mistress of the Mines.Seeker of Truth^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Mistress of the Mines^Mistress of the Mines^The Great Murkblood Revolt^^^Find a Murkblood Overseer and interrogate him. Return to the Mistress of the Mines with the Murkblood information and the Hand of the Overseer.^These miners are far too stupid to concoct any type of escape plan. We must find and punish the source. Venture into the depths of the mine and seek out the Murkblood overseers. If they have not been overcome by the denizens of the mine, they will undoubtedly be hiding. Once you locate one, interrogate him until he reveals the true mastermind behind the escape. Return to me with the identity of this traitor and the hand of the overseer.Crazed and Confused^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Ronag the Slave Driver^Ronag the Slave Driver^^The Netherwing Mines^^Ronag the Slave Driver in the Netherwing Mines of Shadowmoon Valley wants you to slay the Crazed Murkblood Foreman and 5 Crazed Murkblood Miners.^Don't worry about this dragon, <name>. We've got plans for it... Deeper in this mine is a band of crazed Murkblood. After the dragon broke out, they were cut off from the exit. Somehow, after a mere 2 days of isolation, they've lost all sense of decency. They've resorted to cannibalism and the promotion of mayhem. We don't need that kind of madness in this place. Find 'em and kill 'em. All of 'em.Stand Tall, Captain!^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Rise, Overseer!^Disrupting the Twilight Portal, The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron, Hail, Commander!^Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Well, well, well... still alive I see. That's good, because Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his tower at once. Get a move on!Escape from Skettis^70^All^Skettis^Skyguard Prisoner^Sky Sergeant Doryn^^To Skettis!^^Escort the Skyguard Prisoner to safety and report to Sky Sergeant Doryn.^Hail, <name>. I thank you for coming to my aid. The arakkoa's monstrous birds knocked me from my nether ray while on a scouting mission. Let's get out of here, while we can.Disrupting the Twilight Portal^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Mor'ghor^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Stand Tall, Captain!^^Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill 20 Deathshadow Agents.^One of your responsibilities as a captain of Dragonmaw is to snuff out Burning Legion activity in Outland. It is your duty to silence those that defy Lord Illidan! The demons foolishly attempt to stabilize the portal found on the Twilight Ridge of western Nagrand. They must pay for their treachery, and you will be the orc that collects on their debt. Travel to the Twilight Ridge and lay waste to its inhabitants. You will be responsible for making at least one attack per day on their fortifications.The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Illidari Lord Balthas^Illidari Lord Balthas^The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron^Stand Tall, Captain!^^Illidari Lord Balthas at the Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to bring him 2 Felsteel Bars, 1 Adamantite Frame, 1 Khorium Power Core and 1 Flawless Arcane Essence.^Reth'hedron now lords over the Twilight Ridge of Nagrand. An eredar of such power being loosed upon this world does not bode well for the Illidari. Alas, we do not have the resources required to slay Reth'hedron. Not with the war the Sha'tar have brought to the Black Temple. No... I have a better plan. You will subdue Reth'hedron, banishing him back through the Twilight Portal. For this a soul cannon must be fashioned. Return to me with the materials on this list.Subdue the Subduer^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Illidari Lord Balthas^Illidari Lord Balthas^The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron^^^Illidari Lord Balthas at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley has tasked you with using the Soul Cannon on Reth'hedron the Subduer in Nagrand.^<Balthas holds up an alien looking device.> This is a soul cannon. Its effects are devastating when attuned. This one is attuned to my blood. The same blood flowing through the veins of Reth'hedron - my brother. Aye, his misplaced allegiance will be the end of him. Take the cannon and fly to the Twilight Ridge in western Nagrand. Locate Reth'hedron and fire! You must stay on your mount and within range for the effects to take hold. Stand your ground against him and he will have no choice but to flee!A Special Thank You^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Chu'a'lor^Jho'nass^^^^Speak with Jho'nass at Ogri'la in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^You honor us with your efforts on our behalf. And now there is someone that we would like for you to meet. Jho'nass is our most trusted quartermaster. He maintains a stock of goods that we provide for sale to only the most dedicated of friends to Ogri'la. You are one such friend, <name>. When you find the time, go and speak with him. As we understand it, he has prepared a little something for you as a token of our appreciation.Hail, Commander!^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Stand Tall, Captain!^Kill Them All!, Kill Them All!^Speak with Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^Captain <name>! <Taskmaster Varkule salutes you.> Overlord Mor'ghor has asked to see you in his chambers at once!Hungry Nether Rays^70^All^Skettis^Skyguard Handler Deesak^Skyguard Handler Deesak^^To Skettis!^^Use the Nether Ray Cage in the woods south of Blackwind Landing and slay Blackwind Warp Chasers near the Hungry Nether Ray. Return to Skyguard Handler Deesak when you've completed your task.^Nether rays are surprisingly loyal and obedient once properly trained. Unfortunately the war on Skettis is taking a toll on them. We have dozens of sorties a day - the poor fellows rarely get a break. And with recent shortages on feed, if those blasted birdmen don't kill them on a mission then starvation will. If you can lend a hand, take one of our rays to the woods in the south. They don't mind warp chaser meat as long as it's a fresh kill.Kill Them All!^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Mor'ghor^Arcanist Thelis^Kill Them All!^Hail, Commander!^^Deliver news of your mission along with the Dragonmaw Flare Gun to Arcanist Thelis at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley.^Commander <name>, stand at attention! You are to take a battalion of Skybreakers and sack the Scryers' outpost located at the foot of the Netherwing Fields. With the Sanctum of the Stars destroyed, our lines of communication to our posts at Eclipse Point and Illidari Point will once more be open. Go now! Use this flare gun to signal the Skybreakers for the attack!Commander Hobb^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Arcanist Thelis^Commander Hobb^Kill Them All!^^The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid^Give the Dragonmaw Flare to Commander Hobb at the Sanctum of the Stars in Shadowmoon Valley.^The Dragonmaw only dare attack us when our guard is down. They would face certain defeat if they were to attack us while we were prepared. I want you to let them come, <name>. <Thelis nods.> Yes... a trap. Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Hobb. He is standing guard right outside this building.Threat from Above^70^All^Shattrath City^Yuula^Yuula^Threat from Above^^To Skettis!^Slay any 20 Gordunni Ogres in the Barrier Hills and return to Yuula in Shattrath City.^So you want to join the Skyguard? Well, I know you can fly... but can you fight? The Skyguard is sworn to protect Shattrath from the dangers that loom above us, both near and far. The Gordunni ogres who dwell in the Barrier Hills to the north are an immediate threat to us. Reaching the ogres has been problematic for Shattrath's ground units. That's where we come in. See what you can do to help contain them.The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Commander Hobb^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Commander Hobb^^Assist Commander Hobb and the Scryers in defending the Sanctum of the Stars. Once all of the Dragonmaw forces have been defeated, return to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp with the Scryer Medals.^Take these Scryer medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of "victory" once this is over. He will recognize them as coming from the corpses of fallen Scryer soldiers. Now all that remains is to use the signal flare to alert the Dragonmaw raiders. We will crush them when you are ready. Just give me the word.To Skettis!^70^ ^Skettis^Yuula^Sky Sergeant Doryn^Threat from Above^^Fires Over Skettis, Escape from Skettis, Hungry Nether Rays^Take the Explosives Package to Sky Sergeant Doryn at Blackwind Landing outside Skettis.^The Barrier Hills are only one of the fronts where we've been deployed. A less immediate but far more dangerous threat looms from beyond the Skethyl Mountains, from within the arakkoa city of Skettis. A few months ago our scouts detected a huge increase in arakkoa activity there. Several attacks against Shattrath followed. We've stationed forces outside of their city since. Take these explosives to Sergeant Doryn at Blackwind Landing, just outside Skettis. Tell him you're a new recruit.Kill Them All!^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Mor'ghor^Anchorite Ceyla^Kill Them All!^Hail, Commander!^^Deliver news of your mission and the Dragonmaw Flare Gun to Anchorite Ceyla at the Altar of Sha'tar.^Commander <name>, stand at attention! You are to take a battalion of Skybreakers and sack the Aldor outpost located northwest of our beloved Black Temple. With the Altar of Sha'tar destroyed, our lines of communication to our posts at Coilskar will once more be open. Go now! Use this flare gun to signal the Skybreakers for the attack!Commander Arcus^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Anchorite Ceyla^Commander Arcus^Kill Them All!^^The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid^Give the Dragonmaw Flare to Commander Arcus at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley.^The Dragonmaw only dare attack us when our guard is down. They would face certain defeat if they were to attack us while we were prepared. I want you to let them come, <name>. <Ceyla nods.> Yes... a trap. Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Arcus. He is standing guard right outside this building.The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Commander Arcus^Overlord Mor'ghor^^Commander Arcus^^Assist Commander Arcus and the Aldor in defending the Altar of Sha'tar. Once all of the Dragonmaw forces have been defeated, return to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp with the Aldor Medals.^Take these Aldor medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of "victory" once this is over. He will recognize them as coming from the corpses of fallen Aldor soldiers. Now all that remains is to use the signal flare to alert the Dragonmaw raiders. We will crush them when you are ready. Just give me the word.Bombing Run^70^All^Druid^Sky Sergeant Vanderlip^Sky Sergeant Vanderlip^Bombing Run^^Bomb Them Again!^Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.^You can fly around as a crow... so what! Ever annihilate something on the ground while you were flying? Want to? Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la. With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business. Want to prove yourself? Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks. Just don't let them shoot you down, too!Bow to the Highlord^70^ ^Shadowmoon Valley^Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath^Overlord Mor'ghor^Bow to the Highlord^^^Speak to Overlord Mor'ghor at Dragonmaw Base Camp in Shadowmoon Valley.^I am unworthy to even carry a message directed at you, sir. Please forgive me for this indulgence. Overlord Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his chambers at once!Lord Illidan Stormrage^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Overlord Mor'ghor^Barthamus^Bow to the Highlord^^Jorus the Cobalt Netherwing Drake, Malfas the Purple Netherwing Drake, Onyxien the Onyx Netherwing Drake, Suraku the Azure Netherwing Drake, Voranaku the Violet Netherwing Drake, Zoya the Veridian Netherwing Drake^Meet Illidan Stormrage. Seek out Barthamus in the Lower City of Shattrath should you survive.^Come, highlord <name>. Illidan himself awaits us!Assault on Bash'ir Landing!^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Sky Commander Keller^Aether-tech Apprentice^^^^Speak with the Aether-tech Apprentice at Skyguard Outpost in the Blade's Edge Mountains.^Heya, <boyo /girly>! Up fer some fun are ye? Every couple o' hours, me aether-techs launch an assault on Bash'ir Landing, far ta the northeast in the Blade's Edge Mountains. They say that they're there 'studying' the Bash'ir crystalforge, but it's an assault; there be no two ways about it. We use the crystalforge to resupply, and there's always extra to be sold. Go on down ta the landin' pad and speak with the aether-tech apprentice. He'll tell ye when the next mission is ta launch.Inspecting the Ruins^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Garran Vimes^Inspector Tarem^They Call Him Smiling Jim^^^Speak to Inspector Tarem at the Shady Rest Inn.^Poor James never recovered from the destruction of the Shady Rest and the murder of his family. The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this. I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping. The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers.Inspecting the Ruins^35^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Krog^Inspector Tarem^^^^Speak to Inspector Tarem at the Shady Rest Inn.^If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. Theramore has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. Normally, I'd advise you to steer clear, but we have orders from Orgrimmar to 'assist' in the investigation. Accept any help the Theramore investigator offers, even feed him a tidbit or two of information if you'd like, but save your real findings for me.Traitors Among Us^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Calia Hastings^Calia Hastings^Traitors Among Us^^^Confront 5 Deserter Agitators and return to Calia Hastings near the docks in Theramore.^It's good to meet you, <class>. I've come to Theramore to help eliminate the problem of the deserters. Not only have some of the men abandoned their posts, but some have filtered back into the town. These deserter agents are spreading lies and propaganda, hoping to convince others to join their ranks. They're at virtually every guard post throughout the town and the docks. Find them, expose them, and discredit them. At this point, anything more risks inspiring more sympathy for them.Propaganda War^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Calia Hastings^Calia Hastings^Traitors Among Us^^Discrediting the Deserters^Bring the Deserter Propaganda to Calia Hastings near the docks in Theramore.^The deserter agents were doing far more than just chatting up the guards. We've found a number of leaflets the deserters somehow managed to smuggle in on a ship in the docks. The ship used to transport the leaflets is still in Theramore, at the farthest dock. If you can sneak aboard and capture the rest of their propaganda documents, their agents will lose their most powerful tool. Be careful! The ship is manned by seasoned privateers and the cargo is probably being kept in the captain's quarters.Kyle's Gone Missing!^7^Horde^Mulgore^Ahab Wheathoof^Ahab Wheathoof^^^^Ahab Wheathoof at Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore wants you to feed his prized puppy, Kyle the Frenzied.^Help, <name>! My prized puppy, Kyle, has run away! I just know he's running around Bloodhoof Village, lost and hungry. Will you find him and feed him? Once he eats he will settle down and come home. To feed him you will need to find food. His favorite meal is tender strider meat. Just venture east and you should find plenty of striders. Hunt one down and take its succulent meat to Kyle. When you see Kyle in town, put the meat down and he is sure to come to you.Oooh, Shinies!^70^All^Zul'Aman^Griftah^Budd Nedreck^Oooh, Shinies!^^^Griftah wants you to take Griftah's Note to Budd in the Ghostlands, just outside of Zul'Aman.^Come closer, <man/sweetheart>! Let ol' Griftah look at yer shiny things.... Hmm. Yeh, yeh, not bad, but ya can do better. Much, much better. <Griftah leans in and whispers.> There be priceless shinies everywhere, <name>, ya just gotta know where to look! It be yer lucky day; I know a fella who can help ya find more shinies than ya can ever carry. Visit my ol' friend, Budd, near Zul'Aman and show him this here. Ya be tellin' him ol' Griftah sent ya and he'll let ya in on his new project.Promises, Promises...^70^All^Zul'Aman^Budd Nedreck^Budd Nedreck^Oooh, Shinies!^^^Budd Nedreck in Hatchet Hills wants you to retrieve his map from High Priest Nalorakk's terrace in Zul'Aman.^My inscrutable theories confirm rumors of vast treasure in Zul'Aman. There'll be mounts and mansions for everyone! First things first, though. You must earn your share, after all.... Our initial efforts here haven't gone as well as I hoped. In fact, my map, and the recruits I lent it to, have gone missing. They were after a troll-beast named Nalorakk. Forget the crew, I need that map! Succeed, and you'll go down in history as the one who helped Budd Nedreck unlock the secrets of Zul'Aman!Discrediting the Deserters^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Calia Hastings^Calia Hastings^Discrediting the Deserters^Propaganda War^^Calia Hastings wants you to distribute the Altered Leaflets to 6 Theramore Guards, then report back to her near the docks in Theramore.^I've altered the leaflets you captured from the deserters' mercenary friends at the docks. Now, anyone who reads them will get an entirely different view of the deserters and their aims. If we distribute these to enough of the guards, the deserters will be too embarrassed to ever reestablish their presence within our walls. <Calia hands you a stack of the altered leaflets.> Why don't you get started while I plan our next move?The End of the Deserters^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Calia Hastings^Calia Hastings^Discrediting the Deserters^^A Disturbing Development, The Hermit of Swamplight Manor^Capture Gavis Greyshield, then report to Calia Hastings near the docks in Theramore.^Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation. My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks. Arresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight. Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender. I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands he can't win.A Disturbing Development^36^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Lieutenant Aden^Captain Wymor^A Disturbing Development^The End of the Deserters^^Report to Captain Wymor at Sentry Point.^Reports from our scout patrols have recently taken a disturbing turn. They tell of men wearing red Defias bandanas walking the Dreadmurk Shore north of Theramore's walls. Wreckage in the area suggests they may be survivors of a shipwreck, but our information is limited. Captain Wymor at Sentry Point, a guard tower to the north of the city, is looking for help in following up on the reports.Defias in Dustwallow?^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Wymor^Captain Wymor^A Disturbing Development^^^Obtain the Defias Orders from Garn Mathers and bring them to Captain Wymor at Sentry Point.^My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas! The Defias are craftsmen and guildsmen, not sailors. What are they doing at the site of a shipwreck on a continent they've no interest in? Their leader is rumored to reside on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession.Renn McGill^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Wymor^Renn McGill^A Disturbing Development^^^Bring the Defias Orders to Renn McGill in the waters off the Dreadmurk Shore.^From the wording of the orders you recovered, it looks like the first priority of the Defias will be to locate and secure whatever cargo they possessed. SI:7 has had a salvage diver named Renn McGill working out of Theramore for some time. When he heard about the shipwreck, Renn went north to dive near the islands the Defias now occupy. If we're to beat the Defias to this cargo, we'll need his help. Look for him in the waters northeast of a small island just north of the island you visited earlier.Secondhand Diving Gear^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Renn McGill^Renn McGill^A Disturbing Development^^^Bring the Tool Kit and Damaged Diving Gear to Renn McGill in the Dustwallow Marsh.^There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative "borrowing" first. Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time!Recover the Cargo!^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Renn McGill^Renn McGill^A Disturbing Development^^Jaina Must Know^Bring 6 Salvaged Strongboxes to Renn McGill in Dustwallow Marsh.^Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though. The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce.Jaina Must Know^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Renn McGill^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Jaina Must Know^Recover the Cargo!^^Speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore.^You must bring news of our findings to Lady Jaina without delay! If the Defias were transporting a prisoner, there's no telling who it might be or if the person is still alive! One thing is for certain, <name>. The Defias wouldn't go to all this trouble for some petty grudge. Their prisoner must have been someone of importance. Lady Jaina would know better than anyone else what these findings mean. You'll find her at the top of the mage tower at Theramore's center.Survey Alcaz Island^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Jaina Must Know^^Proof of Treachery^Speak to Cassa Crimsonwing and use one of her gryphons to survey Alcaz Island. When your survey is complete, speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore.^It looks like Renn's hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there. Theramore's defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's gryphon master, to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air. Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the Defias' involvement in this kidnapping.A Grim Connection^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Garran Vimes^Captain Darill^^The Deserters^Confirming the Suspicion, Arms of the Grimtotems^Report to Captain Darill at North Point.^I've spoken with Inspector Tarem regarding the evidence you gathered from the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. He seems certain that the hoofprints and the shield you found there point to the Grimtotem clan of tauren. With reports of Grimtotem activity on the rise in the marsh, this has to be more than a mere coincidence. I'm sending you to speak with Captain Darill, who is something of an expert on the Grimtotems. Follow the road north out of town to North Point tower. It's the second outpost on the road.Confirming the Suspicion^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Darill^Captain Darill^^A Grim Connection^Tabetha's Assistance^Bring the Grimtotem Battle Plan to Captain Darill at North Point Tower.^The Grimtotems may be the most warlike of all the tauren clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders. There's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek.Prisoners of the Grimtotems^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Sergeant Lukas^Sergeant Lukas^^Raptor Captor^^Sergeant Lukas at North Point Tower wants you to free 5 Theramore Prisoners.^We're doing all we can to keep the Grimtotem raiders at bay, but they keep launching assaults on the tower. Even worse, they've managed to discover and capture the patrols the captain sends out to gather information and safeguard the road. I suspect the captives are being held in Blackhoof Village, to the northwest. Knowing the Grimtotems, the defenders of the village probably carry the keys to the prisoners' cages with them. I don't care what you have to do, <class>, just bring back my men alive.Raptor Captor^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Sergeant Lukas^Sergeant Lukas^^^Prisoners of the Grimtotems, Unleash the Raptors^Sergeant Lukas at North Point Tower wants you to capture 6 raptors. You can capture either Bloodfen Raptors or Bloodfen Screechers.^The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors. Take this rope and use it to capture bloodfen raptors or bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle.Unleash the Raptors^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Sergeant Lukas^Sergeant Lukas^^Raptor Captor^^Sergeant Lukas at North Point Tower wants you to place the Raptor Bait near the windmill in Blackhoof Village.^Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to "encourage" them to attack the Grimtotems at Blackhoof Village to the northwest. I've got a leftover haunch of... well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took.Arms of the Grimtotems^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Darill^Captain Darill^^A Grim Connection^^Captain Darill at North Point Tower wants you to bring him 7 Blackhoof Armaments.^If the equipment you found at the ruins of the inn belonged to a Grimtotem attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest. We haven't been able to gather much information about Blackhoof Village, but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there. Do whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn.Tabetha's Assistance^39^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Darill^Tabetha^Tabetha's Assistance^Confirming the Suspicion^^Speak with Tabetha at her farm.^I can't spare any men to help search for a second Grimtotem outpost, but I think I know of someone who might be able to help you. Deep in the Quagmire, to the south, there is a small farmstead owned by Tabetha. She may seem little more than an old hermit, but the truth is that she's a mage and scryer of some renown. Follow the road south to her farm and seek her help in finding the culprits responsible for the massacre at the Shady Rest Inn.Raze Direhorn Post!^39^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Tabetha^Tabetha^Tabetha's Assistance^^^Burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post, then return to Tabetha at her farm.^There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new "neighbors" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer. Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.Justice for the Hyals^39^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Tabetha^Captain Garran Vimes^Tabetha's Assistance^^^Speak to Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel in Theramore.^Although these Grimtotems were simply a nuisance to me, Captain Vimes will want to know of your deeds. Bring him the news that you have tracked down and dealt with those responsible for the burning of the Shady Rest Inn. It's too late to save Jim Hyal's family, but perhaps the Grimtotems will think twice before attacking anyone connected to Theramore.Peace at Last^39^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Captain Garran Vimes^Captain Garran Vimes^Tabetha's Assistance^^^Captain Garran Vimes at Foothold Citadel wants you to lay the Wreath at the Hyal Family Monument.^I wish we had a way of letting James Hyal's wife and son know that we have brought their murderers to justice. <Captain Vimes produces a small wreath decorated with flowers.> There are some who say that their spirits will know, even if we cannot reach them. It's not much, but I'd like you to lay this wreath at the Hyal family monument. It's one of the larger stones in the graveyard just north of Theramore's gates.Break the Blockade^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Bombardier Petrov^Bombardier Petrov^^^^Take Petrov's Cluster Bombs and drop them on enough pirates to kill or destroy 25 Blockade Pirates and 10 Blockade Cannons. Once you've accomplished that, return to Bombardier Petrov at Westguard Keep.^All of our ships are sunk! We need your help to break the pirate blockade below in the Shattered Straits! Take these cluster bombs and hitch a ride on the zeppelin that Harrowmeiser has 'loaned' to us. He'll fly you over the decks of those pirate scoundrels, and you make sure to give it to them good! If you can't bomb them to smithereens, I'm afraid we'll never be able to break the blockade.Scare the Guano Out of Them!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Engineer Feknut^Engineer Feknut^^^^Collect 10 Darkclaw Guano and deliver them to Engineer Feknut at Steel Gate.^You, yes you... I need your help! Petrov sent me up here to get bat guano for the cluster bombs he's making back at the keep. He sent me to my doom! The darkclaw bats hang out in the Rivenwood to the north, but I'm not taking a step off of this platform unless it's to go home! But you... you could get it for me! Yes? Pretty please?!!! Here, take these firecrackers. My thinking is that if you drop 'em underneath the bats, the guano will be scared right out of them!Shoveltusk Soup Again?^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Chef Kettleblack^Chef Kettleblack^^^^Chef Kettleblack has asked you to obtain 6 Shoveltusk Meat and deliver them to her at Westguard Keep.^With all of the strange disappearances of our livestock, we better resupply in a hurry, or the beasties around these parts will be the least of our worries! Seeing as I'm in charge of feeding this lot, I'm going to need you to head east and get me some meat. More to the point, I'm looking to cook us up some tender shoveltusk meat. Just beware the stags... they're mean!Direhorn Raiders^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Apprentice Morlann^Apprentice Morlann^^^^Kill 12 Direhorn Grimtotems and return to Apprentice Morlann at Tabetha's Farm.^The Grimtotems up at Direhorn Post, just to the north, are getting bolder by the day. At night, you can often hear them chanting about their deeds in battle against people who've tried to settle here. They're determined to drive us from Tabetha's farm even though she's trained generations of apprentices here. We've defended the farm as best we can, but Apprentice Garion was wounded in the last attack. Go to Direhorn Post and kill any Grimtotem you can find! The attacks must stop.The Clutches of Evil^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Captain Adams^^^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Destroy 15 Proto-Drake Eggs and 15 Proto-Whelps, and then return to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.^<name>, I don't trust anyone but you to take care of this. I need the proto-drake eggs and proto-whelps in the burning forest to the southeast destroyed! Since we arrived here, the Ember Clutch has been ablaze; there must be some sort of perverse magic at work. And lately it seems to be growing. My men tell me that if we don't do something quickly, we'll be surrounded on all sides by the fire within a few weeks' time! Get down there and eliminate the threat by destroying those eggs and the proto-whelps.Bloodfen Feathers^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Brogg^Brogg^^^Banner of the Stonemaul, The Essence of Enmity^Bring 5 Bloodfen Feathers to Brogg at Mudsprocket.^Are you startled by Brogg's presence here, little <race>? Don't worry. Goblins at Mudsprocket are Brogg's friends and you can be, too. Brogg left Brackenwall Village when new overlord not take revenge against black dragonkin for destroying old home and killing many of Brogg's old friends. Brogg come here to lay friends spirits to rest and avenge them, but Brogg need help preparing. For ritual, Brogg need feathers with strong magic, like ones worn by raptors at Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town.Spirits of Stonemaul Hold^41^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Brogg^Brogg^Spirits of Stonemaul Hold^^^Brogg, at Mudsprocket, wants you to put 10 Stonemaul Spirits to rest.^Brogg has completed the totem that will put the spirits of his friends to rest. When the dragonkin came, they killed all Stonemaul who did not flee. Brogg fled with Overlord Mok'Morokk, hoping to lead a counterattack with other Stonemaul survivors. The counterattack never came and the spirits of the Stonemaul dead still haunt Brogg and the others. Take this totem north to Stonemaul Ruins and use it near ogre skeletons to draw the spirit to you. Defeat the spirit to give it rest with its bones.Banner of the Stonemaul^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Brogg^Brogg^^Bloodfen Feathers^^Retrieve the Stonemaul Banner and bring it to Brogg at Mudsprocket.^When the dragons came and took over Brogg's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner. Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends. Brogg's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, <name>.The Essence of Enmity^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Brogg^Brogg^^Bloodfen Feathers^^Bring 10 Black Dragonkin Essences to Brogg at Mudsprocket.^To make the totem Brogg will need for his ritual, he must use the essences of the creatures who killed his friends. The hate and anger of Brogg's enemies will fuel the magic of his vengeance. Track down Firemane ash tails, scouts, or scalebanes and use Brogg's totem on their corpses. Only when the dragonkin die will they give up their essences. The creatures you seek swarm over the Den of Flame to the northwest and the Stonemaul Ruins to the north.Challenge to the Black Flight^41^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Brogg^Brogg^Spirits of Stonemaul Hold^^^Plant the Stonemaul Banner near the entrance to Onyxia's Lair, wait for Onyxia's response, then return to Brogg at Mudsprocket.^Brogg relishes the thought of taking his revenge on the black dragonkin of the marsh. <name>, you have been very helpful in preparing for this moment. Will you help? Take Brogg's clan banner and travel east until you see a cave like a dragon's mouth. At the entrance to that cave, plant Stonemaul banner and issue Brogg's challenge to Onyxia. Brogg and the Stonemaul will have their lands back!Undercover Sister^70^All^Ghostlands^Donna Brascoe^Donna Brascoe^^Blood of the Warlord^^Report to Donna Brascoe to collect a reward for your heroism in Zul'Aman. Donna is currently stationed in the Ghostlands, just outside Zul'aman.^<Donna looks around and then whispers to you.> <name>, what I'm about to tell you must remain confidential, understood? I've been sent by the Shattrath Peacekeepers to infiltrate Budd's gang here. Truth be told, since you first arrived you've been a key person of interest in my investigation. But your deeds have since cleared you of any suspicion. In fact, for your slaying of the crazed warlord, Zul'Jin, I'm compelled to reward you for your efforts.Tuskin' Raiders^70^All^Zul'Aman^Prigmon^Prigmon^Tuskin' Raiders^^^Prigmon needs you to collect 10 Forest Troll Tusks from the trolls in Zul'Aman. Bring them to him at Budd's camp in the Ghostlands.^Ey mon! You be new around 'ere, eh? Lemme ask a favor of ya. Budd's been refinin' his forest troll disguise. Says that he be close now - just be needin' one last touch. Tusks. My skinnin' talents be wasted 'ere. Somethin' about yankin' troll tusks be makin me queasy. Bring me back 10 troll tusks, eh mon?A Troll Among Trolls^70^All^Zul'Aman^Prigmon^Zungam^Tuskin' Raiders^^^Prigmon has tasked you with locating and assisting his cousin Zungam, somewhere within Zul'Aman.^Lissen mon, there be sumthin' else needs doin fer ol' Prigmon. Zungam, my good-fer-nuthin' cousin, be stuck inside Zul'Aman. He still be alive too - I seen his signal flare just last night! I should be lettin' him rot fer gettin' me tied up in this mess, but he be owin' me big money. Do what ya can to help him out, then leave the collectin' to me!X Marks... Your Doom!^70^All^Zul'Aman^Budd Nedreck^Budd Nedreck^Oooh, Shinies!^^^Enter Zul'Aman and visit Halazzi's Chamber, Jan'alai's Platform, and Akil'zon's Platform. Report the details of those areas to Budd, at his camp in the Ghostlands.^How did those fools fail? I told them to be careful - even gave them disguises to help them blend in. Ahh, well. The bright side of their failure is that this opportunity falls to you. Succeed, and you'll be well on your way to joining my crew and sharing in the immeasurable fame that will soon be mine. Not that I need any more, mind you. There are yet a few portions of my map that require further exploration before our excavation can be initiated....The New Plague^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Lysander^Apothecary Lysander^The New Plague^^^Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing wants you to recover 10 Intact Plague Containers from the wrecked ship to the southeast.^Not long after Arthas condemned us to this wretched existence, we in the Royal Apothecary Society endeavored to create a plague of our own. A plague that would devour all flesh: living, dead or undead. We've succeeded in creating this plague and we're here to hand deliver it to the Scourge's doorstep. The Alliance intercepted the ship carrying the latest strain engineered in our Undercity laboratories. Head to the wreckage southeast of here and salvage whatever containers you can.Spiking the Mix^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Lysander^Apothecary Lysander^The New Plague^^^Bring 3 Giant Toxin Glands from Giant Tidecrawlers to Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord.^I've a feeling the long trip across the sea is affecting the effectiveness of our plague. What is needed is a potent toxin to boost the potency of the strain. The crabs near this beach are a distant relative of the much smaller brown-shelled tidecrawler. The smaller tropical variety produces a paralytic toxin strong enough to knock out an ogre. As we all know bigger is better! The much larger glands on the local variety should prove more potent. Bring me a few!The Grimtotem Weapon^38^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Apprentice Garion^Apprentice Garion^^^^Apprentice Garion at Tabetha's Farm wants you to test the Captured Totem on 10 Mottled Drywallow Crocolisks or Drywallow Daggermaws.^During the last Grimtotem attack, I was wounded, but not before I managed to capture a curious totem our enemies were using against us. It seemed to be emitting raw bolts of energy during the battle, but in all my experiments, I haven't managed to figure out how it works. I'll loan the totem to you if you agree to help me test it. The watery areas surrounding the farm are home to pesky mottled drywallow crocolisks and drywallow daggermaws. Try fighting the crocolisks near the totem.Test at Sea^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Lysander^Apothecary Lysander^The New Plague^^New Agamand^Speak to Bat Handler Camille and take a riding bat to intercept the Alliance reinforcements. Once above their fleet, use the Plague Vials to infect 16 North Fleet reservists.^We've just received word of reinforcements coming to the aid of the Alliance forces. Their timing couldn't be better! We're in sore need of test subjects and these North Fleet reservists will do nicely! Take these plague vials with you and speak to Camille, the Bat Handler. Tell her you need to commandeer a riding bat for a special assignment for us. Once you're at sea, drop the vials on the reinforcement fleet. I can't wait to see the results!Hex Lord? Hah!^70^All^Zul'Aman^Budd Nedreck^Budd Nedreck^Oooh, Shinies!^^^Budd Nedreck in Hatchet Hills wants you to kill Hex Lord Malacrass in Zul'Aman.^Excellent! Everything's nearly ready for my grand entrance into Zul'Aman. You've done a fine job, <name>. I've spoken with my crew and they're warming up to you nicely. I'd say you're very close to becoming a permanent member of the team. Only one thing remains for you to do - dispatch that 'Hex Lord' fellow. Nothing to it, really. You stand up to this wretch and he'll likely just turn and run. Weaker, older trolls just add intimidating titles to their name to make up for their deficiencies, you see?The Zeppelin Crash^40^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Apprentice Morlann^Moxie Steelgrille^^^Corrosion Prevention^Speak with Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck.^Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the Steamwheedle Cartel passed through here a few days ago. She was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and it's pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried. If you have time, you may want to check up on her out at Beezil's Wreck, due east of here, near the mountains.The Reagent Thief^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Apprentice Garion^Apprentice Garion^^^^Bring 6 vials of Marsh Venom to Apprentice Garion at Tabetha's Farm.^If there's one thing you can count on Apprentice Morlann to do, it's whine about reagents. Normally, I just ignore him, and it never works. This time, I'm going to try something different. Maybe if I replace the missing reagents before he notices, he'll leave me alone. The most common reagent we both use is marsh venom, which comes from the darkfang creepers and noxious shredders in the marsh north of the farm. If you bring me the venom, I'll replace it before Morlann notices it's gone.Corrosion Prevention^40^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Moxie Steelgrille^Moxie Steelgrille^^The Zeppelin Crash^^Moxie Steelgrille wants you to dissolve 10 oozes and report back to her at Beezil's Wreck.^Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo! I can't go back empty-handed, <class>! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything! This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented power core should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off.My Daughter^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Old Man Stonemantle^Overseer Irena Stonemantle^^Leader of the Deranged^^Old Man Stonemantle has asked you to find his daughter, Overseer Irena Stonemantle, at Steel Gate.^Tell me, is it true? Did the explorers that went into Whisper Gulch go mad? My daughter is the overseer of the Explorers' League that went north to some place called Steel Gate. With the horrible events that have befallen us, I fear for her safety. Please, <class>, I am too old to make the journey. Her name is Irena. Will you go make certain that she is alright?See to the Operations^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Overseer Irena Stonemantle^Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist^See to the Operations^Leader of the Deranged^^Explorer Irena Stonemantle has asked you to speak with a Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist at Steel Gate.^Our work out here is really just beginning. But now that we've brought these flying machines in from Westguard Keep, it should really pick up. The problem is that we're lacking enough qualified pilots. And with things getting worse in the Rivenwood to the north, I'd like to get things wrapped up here quickly and then head back home. If you can lend a hand, go have a chat with one of my chief archaeologists. You'll find them next to the flying machines on the north and south sides of the site.The Hermit of Swamplight Manor^36^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Sergeant Amelyn^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^^The End of the Deserters^^Speak to "Swamp Eye" Jarl at Swamplight Manor.^There's a fellow the locals know as "Swamp Eye" Jarl, who lives alone out in the swamp. Sometime ago he "took over" Swamplight Manor after the previous owners disappeared under mysterious circumstances. I like to send someone to check up on him every once in a while. He kind of reminds me of my grandfather, you know? Some say he's not quite right in the head. If you're headed northwest on the road out of Theramore, you'll find Swamplight Manor in the Witch Hill area, before the road turns west.Blood of the Warlord^70^All^Zul'Aman^Blood of Zul'jin^Budd Nedreck^^^Undercover Sister^Bring the Blood of Zul'jin to Budd at his camp in the Ghostlands, outside Zul'Aman.^As you examine the pulsating vial, your thoughts turn to the petulant little man outside Zul'Aman. You can't wait to see Budd's expression when he sees this!What's Haunting Witch Hill?^36^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Mordant Grimsby^Mordant Grimsby^What's Haunting Witch Hill?^^^Mordant Grimsby at Swamplight Manor wants you to gather information from 10 Risen Husks or Risen Spirits.^I traveled out here to pay Jarl a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it... Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about Witch Hill? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl!The Witch's Bane^36^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Mordant Grimsby^Mordant Grimsby^What's Haunting Witch Hill?^^^Bring 9 sprigs of Witchbane to Mordant Grimsby at Swamplight Manor.^In my years as an herbalist, I've often observed that nature will provide subtle cures to the most vexing of problems. I've read that hedge mages and witch doctors often use the smoke of an herb known as witchbane to draw evil from its hiding places. If true, this would mean witchbane should be growing near the shallow waters of Witch Hill. You should be able to identify it by its broad leaves and reddish central stalk. Bring me any of the herb you can find, <name>. It may be our only hope.Root Causes^71^All^Howling Fjord^Ember Clutch Ancient^Ember Clutch Ancient^^^^Slay 5 Dragonflayer Handlers and Skeld Drakeson. If you manage to do so, return to an Ember Clutch Ancient in the Ember Clutch.^All things in nature seek a balance. It is only through the interference of those not in tune with that harmony that the balance is shifted. You waste your efforts when you kill the whelps and drakes. The real culprits behind the expansion of these magically burning woods are the newly awakened vrykul and their master, Skeld Drakeson. If it's blood on your hands that you seek, start with them. You will find their lair on the south side of the Ember Clutch.Cleansing Witch Hill^36^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Mordant Grimsby^Mordant Grimsby^What's Haunting Witch Hill?^^^Mordant Grimsby at Swamplight Manor wants you to plant the torch at the end of the dock and defeat anything that appears.^The torch is ready. Plant it at the end of the dock and be prepared to face whatever comes forth. I have no idea what the torch's smoke may reveal... if anything emerges at all. I must say, I have my doubts about this kind of folk magic, but we haven't time for anything else. For your sake and Jarl's, I wish you luck.WANTED: Goreclaw the Ravenous^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Wanted Poster^Drazzit Dripvalve^^^^Kill Goreclaw the Ravenous and report to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.^Travelers and Steamwheedle personnel working in the field are advised to avoid the Bloodfen Burrow to the west of town. The area is overrun with raptors lead by the cruel and cunning Goreclaw the Ravenous, who has already killed at least two Steamwheedle engineers. Drazzit Dripvalve has authorized a generous reward to be paid to the individual who rids Mudsprocket of this menace.The Apothecary's Letter^38^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Sealed Letter^Andello Porter^^^^Bring the Sealed Letter to Andello Porter at Tabetha's Farm.^Recovered from the body of a Forsaken apothecary, this letter contains alarming evidence of a close alliance between the Grimtotems and the new masters of Lordaeron. "As a demonstration of good faith and a symbol of our newfound trust, we have dispatched Apothecary Cylla to aid you in battling our mutual enemy in the land of Kalimdor. None will stand before our combined might and determination." This letter should be brought to the attention of the SI:7 agent at Tabetha's Farm, Andello Porter.Signs of Treachery?^38^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Sealed Letter^Nazeer Bloodpike^^^^Bring the Sealed Letter to Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village.^Recovered from the body of a Forsaken apothecary, this letter hints at an underground correspondence between Undercity and the Grimtotem leadership. "As a demonstration of good faith and a symbol of our newfound trust, we have dispatched Apothecary Cylla to aid you in battling our mutual enemy in the land of Kalimdor. None will stand before our combined might and determination." Perhaps Nazeer Bloodpike in Brackenwall Village will know how to handle this information.Mage-Lieutenant Malister^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^The Clutches of Evil^^Captain Adams has asked you to speak with his advisor, Mage-Lieutenant Malister, at Westguard Keep.^THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Those proto-drakes are attacking the keep! Beasts such as that should have been scared off when you took care of their clutches and whelps. You did take care of them, right? <name>, this calls for more direct action. Speak with my advisor, Mage-Lieutenant Malister. He'll provide you with the means to get at those infernal creatures.Two Wrongs...^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^^Report to Scout Knowles, Danger! Explosives!, Send Them Packing^Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep has tasked you with the destruction of 3 Proto-Drakes.^Now that we've riled up these Ember Clutch proto-drakes, they may be inclined to continue their attacks upon the keep. This will not do. I hate to compound one wrong with another, but in this case it would appear that we will have to destroy the creatures. A regrettable course of action, but one that we need to undertake regardless. Take my wand. I've been experimenting with increasing its range, but it doesn't pack much of a punch. However, what it will do is get a proto-drake's attention.One Last Time^72^All^Howling Fjord^Tarnished Promise Ring^ ^^^^Escort the Ghost of Explorer Jaren safely to Explorer Irena Stonemantle at Steel Gate in the Howling Fjord.^Hello there. Am I dead? I think I am, because I'm hovering over my body! Oh, what an unfortunate turn of events. I was about to propose to Irena when the Scourge descended on us. I know that she's still alive... I can feel her in my heart. <class>, do you think you might safely get me to her? The Scourge can still see my ghost, and no doubt can do horrible things to me. I'd like to look upon her beautiful face one last time. You can tell her that I love her for me.One Size Does Not Fit All^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Cannoneer Ely^Cannoneer Ely^^^^Cannoneer Ely has tasked you with rounding up 10 Westguard Cannonballs and returning them to him at Westguard Keep.^<Lad /Lass>, who's the genius that made our cannons a non-standard size? Now we have ta make special cannonballs ta shoot out o' the infernal contraptions! I would look kindly on ye if ye would go out and find the balls we've already shot. No doubt with the way these louts shoot they be all o'er the place ta the south and east. <The cannoneer spaces his hands apart to give you an idea of how big the cannonballs are.> That would be faster than us making 'em from scratch fer a certainty.This Old Lighthouse^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Sergeant Amelyn^Babs Fizzletorque^This Old Lighthouse^^^Speak to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse on the island east of Theramore.^The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again. I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know?Thresher Oil^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Babs Fizzletorque^Babs Fizzletorque^This Old Lighthouse^^^Bring 4 containers of Thresher Oil to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse near Theramore.^The old log in the lighthouse indicates that the lamp was fueled with oil from the threshers that live along the coast here. <Babs wrinkles her nose at the mention of such outdated technology.> I suppose it's a practical, if inelegant solution. The log says that the oil taken from the youngest murk threshers works the best, and those live right underneath the docks of Theramore. If you're up for it, would you help resupply the lighthouse with fuel?Dastardly Denizens of the Deep^35^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Babs Fizzletorque^"Dirty" Michael Crowe^This Old Lighthouse^^^Bring Dastardly Denizens of the Deep to "Dirty" Michael Crowe on the Theramore docks.^You know, it's amazing what you can find in that old lighthouse. After I lit the lamp, I noticed this book in one of the old trunks up there. <Babs holds up the book and reads the title dramatically.> "Dastardly Denizens of the Deep!" Why, I think I might swoon if I ever saw one of these! I'm sure it's good for a laugh or two, but I simply don't have time for reading right now. You know who might enjoy it, though... that fishmonger on the docks, "Dirty" Michael Crowe. He collects old books.Is it Real?^36^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^"Dirty" Michael Crowe^Nat Pagle^This Old Lighthouse^^^Talk to Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing in Dustwallow Marsh.^Oh, I'm sure you and Babs had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends? If you listen closely enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old Nat Pagle. He's got a small fishing camp on a little island in Tidefury Cove, which is southwest across Dustwallow Bay.Playin' With Dolls^70^All^Zul'Aman^Zungam^Griftah^Tuskin' Raiders^^^Take the Tattered Voodoo Doll to Griftah in Shattrath City.^I'm touched, <name>, an' dat be da truth. I'm not rememberin' the last time a <race> helped Zungam outta trouble. I snatched this from one of them savages when he was busy chainin' me up. It don't look like much, but if anyone can determine its worth, it be my good friend, Griftah! If ya be makin' it outta here alive, it might be worth takin' this to him out in Shattrath City.Take Down Tethyr!^36^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Major Mills^Major Mills^This Old Lighthouse^^^Major Mills at the Theramore docks wants you to defeat Tethyr.^Sea monster or no, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this Tethyr. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars. I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw its attention.Report to Scout Knowles^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Scout Knowles^Report to Scout Knowles^Two Wrongs...^^Captain Adams has asked you to report to Scout Knowles at the Ember Spear Tower.^<name>, now that those damnable proto-creatures have been dealt with, I've another task for you. One of my scouts has reported back some suspicious activity by the Forsaken to the south. It looks like they're up to no good at the vrykul village known as Halgrind. I want you to personally take over the investigation down there. Speak with Scout Knowles to find out what he's uncovered and proceed from there. His last reported position is at the Ember Spear Tower, just to the west of Halgrind.More than Coincidence^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Krog^Krog^^Return to Krog^^Krog at Brackenwall Village wants you to bring him 7 Blackhoof Armaments.^We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth. Between the hoofprints and the shield with Mosarn's mark, I'm lead to believe that the Grimtotems may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture.The Grimtotem Plot^38^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Krog^Krog^^Return to Krog^Seek Out Tabetha^Bring the Grimtotem Battle Plan to Krog at Brackenwall Village.^With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion. We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target. Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans.Mission: Eternal Flame^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Scout Knowles^Scout Knowles^Report to Scout Knowles^^^Scout Knowles at the Ember Spear Tower has recommended that you use the Ever-burning Torches to destroy the four Plague Tanks surrounding Halgrind.^The Forsaken are up to no good and from what I can tell, those plague tanks of sludge are a big part of it. If I may suggest, <sir /ma'am>, we should probably destroy them before they can get any more use out of the things. I took the liberty of preparing a bundle of torches from the Ember Clutch. These things have been burning for days! Here, I'm sure you can put them to better use than I in destroying those tanks.Seek Out Tabetha^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Krog^Tabetha^Seek Out Tabetha^The Grimtotem Plot^^Speak with Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire.^The arms you captured in Blackhoof Village have not seen any combat beyond mere training exercises, which means the Grimtotems who destroyed the Shady Rest are still at large. To the south, in the heart of the Quagmire, lives the witch Tabetha. Though she is a human, she has dealt honorably with us and trained some of our mages. Ask her for assistance in tracking down the band of Grimtotem responsible for burning the inn. The Alliance must not be allowed to think we were complicit in the attack.Return to Krog^38^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Mosarn^Krog^^Questioning Reethe^More than Coincidence, The Grimtotem Plot^Speak with Krog at Brackenwall Village.^I hope I've been helpful to you and I'm sorry I can't offer more information. My apprentices and I produce such a large volume of arms and armor that it's almost impossible to recall details about any individual piece. Not only do we outfit the braves defending tauren lands, but the Grimtotems have a particular fondness for my work. A seasoned warrior knows good work when he sees it.Raze Direhorn Post!^39^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Tabetha^Tabetha^Seek Out Tabetha^^^Burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post, then return to Tabetha at her farm.^There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new "neighbors" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer. Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.Justice Dispensed^39^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Tabetha^Krog^Seek Out Tabetha^^^Return to Krog at Brackenwall Village.^I doubt the Grimtotems will give up their campaign to drive humans from the marsh. At least we have dealt with the perpetrators of the crimes at the Shady Rest Inn. I'm sure the investigator who sent you doesn't need to be told this, but the Horde can no longer afford not to rein in the Grimtotems. There will be a day when their actions will put the Horde in a regrettable position. Neither Lady Jaina nor Warchief Thrall desire another war, but are they willing to do what's necessary to avoid it?Secure the Cargo!^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Moxie Steelgrille^Moxie Steelgrille^Secure the Cargo!^^^Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck wants you to recover 8 pieces of Zeppelin Cargo.^This zeppelin was carrying six months' worth of supplies to us at Mudsprocket! Sure, they've been able to barter for some of what they need, but they won't hold out forever. I've been sent out here to recover what I can of the cargo, but the wreckage is scattered all over the marsh in this area. I'm sure a lot of the cargo didn't survive the crash, but are you willing to help me recover what we can?Delivery for Drazzit^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Moxie Steelgrille^Drazzit Dripvalve^Secure the Cargo!^^^Take the Zeppelin Cargo to Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.^Drazzit will expect to hear something from me soon, but I don't think the site is secure enough for me to leave. If you have time, would you be willing to take some of the salvaged cargo down to him at Mudsprocket? If you haven't been there yet, it's a small settlement to the southwest of here, beyond the Stonemaul Ruins. You can take the road there from Tabetha's Farm, too. When you get to Mudsprocket, the guy you're looking for is Drazzit Dripvalve.Nat's Bargain^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Nat Pagle^Nat Pagle^This Old Lighthouse^^^Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing wants you to test his new fish bait.^So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes. But you want to know about Tethyr. I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet. Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim over to that wrecked ship to the southwest. If you survive, let me know how it works!Oh, It's Real^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Nat Pagle^Major Mills^This Old Lighthouse^^^Speak with Major Mills at the docks in Theramore.^Yes, Tethyr is certainly real, and he lives in the waters off Theramore. Has a thing for bright lights. He's the reason they shut down the lighthouse in the first place, you know... And if you light it up again, he'll come right back. But no one in their right mind would do that. So that must be your plan! It's been good sharing a drink with you, but don't blame ol' Nat if Tethyr REALLY turns you into fish bait. If you're going to do this, make sure you consult Major Mills at the Theramore docks.Help for Mudsprocket^39^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Tabetha^Drazzit Dripvalve^^^^Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.^When that goblin... what's her name... Boxie, Foxy... Moxie, that's it! Anyway, when she came through here on her way to the zeppelin wreck, she said the town of Mudsprocket was having some problems. That crashed zeppelin was bringing them fresh supplies. If you follow the road south from here, past the Stonemaul Ruins, you'll eventually come to Mudsprocket. Why don't you check in with Drazzit Dripvalve down there and see if there's anything you can do to help?Tabetha's Farm^37^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Guard Byron^Tabetha^^^^Speak with Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire.^Deep in the heart of the swamp lives an old woman named Tabetha. We've never really known much about her, save that she's a good deal older than she appears. She's helped us from time to time and helped keep the peace here between the Horde and our forces. She used to keep in regular contact, but we haven't received one lately. Could you check in with her when you have time? Just follow the road beyond North Point Tower, where it turns south and into the Quagmire. You can see her farm from the road.Check Up on Tabetha^37^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Nazeer Bloodpike^Tabetha^^^^Speak to Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire.^A human woman named Tabetha lives on a small farm near the middle of the marsh. Ordinarily, I wouldn't associate with a human, but her help has proven useful at times. Unfortunately, she's been out of touch for quite some time now and I'm looking for someone to travel down to her farm to see if everything's all right. If you follow the road south out of the village, then into the swamp's interior, you'll find her farm near the middle of the Quagmire.Mission to Mudsprocket^39^Alliance^Dustwallow Marsh^Lieutenant Aden^Drazzit Dripvalve^^^^Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.^The Steamwheedle Cartel has recently established a new outpost in the southern part of Dustwallow Marsh. It's called Mudsprocket, if I recall, and it's located on the main road south out of Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins. This is an excellent opportunity for us to establish new trade contacts and Lady Jaina wants me to send a representative down there to establish contact. Would you be willing to go?Help Mudsprocket^39^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Nazeer Bloodpike^Drazzit Dripvalve^^^^Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.^The Steamwheedle Cartel's new outpost in the southern part of the marsh isn't faring so well. The zeppelin carrying supplies to Mudsprocket crashed, leaving them without vital tools, food, and medical supplies. Follow the road down south and into the marsh's interior. You'll pass by Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins before the road brings you to Mudsprocket. Offer any help you can provide to the town's leadership.Archmage Alturus^70^All^Deadwind Pass^Apprentice Tasserel^Archmage Alturus^^^^Speak to Archmage Alturus outside of Karazhan in Deadwind Pass.^I was sent here by my mentor to look for assistance, but unfortunately I'm not allowed outside of Lower City and the individuals that frequent this establishment tend to be less than helpful. You do seem different, more like the adventurous type. If you're interested in aiding our cause, speak to Archmage Alturus outside of Medivh's old dwelling, Karazhan. In the meantime, I'm going to see about gaining access to the rest of the city. One of our old associates is rumored to be here.Catch a Dragon by the Tail^40^All^Dustwallow Marsh^Gizzix Grimegurgle^Gizzix Grimegurgle^^^^Gizzix Grimegurgle at Mudsprocket wants you to bring him 8 Wyrmtail stalks.^With the zeppelin crash delaying supplies, we've run out of medicines and bandages. We're making use of what we can, but between all the insects, the injuries, and the enemies we're encountering here, I can barely keep up! I've found one herb that seems to help heal wounds and dull pain, but it, too, is in short supply. It's called wyrmtail, and it's abundant in the Dragonmurk and Wyrmbog areas east of town. The plants themselves are made of coiled stalks, and seem to pulsate when you look at them.Danger! Explosives!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Sapper Steelring^Sapper Steelring^Danger! Explosives!^Two Wrongs...^^Use Steelring's Foolproof Dynamite to collect 6 Whisper Gulch Ore Fragments and 18 Whisper Gulch Gems. Then return them to Sapper Steelring at Westguard Keep.^<name>, the captain's tasked me with a mission. I'd like you to help. A bunch of my fellow Explorers' League people went nuts digging up stuff in the Whisper Gulch just to the north. They're attacking anyone trying to get in! The captain is only concerned with the ore for the keep. Lucky for us, I have just the thing to do the trick. Get in there, blow up the ore, and bring it back along with any gems you find. Running this place isn't cheap you know! I gotta warn you though, that ore is strange!Reports from the Field^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^High Executor Anselm^High Executor Anselm^War is Hell^^^Speak to Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael in the battlefield at the Bleeding Vale south of Vengeance Landing. Return to High Executor Anselm when you've completed this task.^Our mission in Northrend is to destroy Arthas. The Alliance are but an obstacle that we'll crush wherever we find them. We've managed to destroy their easternmost fleet; but the survivors have barricaded themselves on the Derelict Strand, south of here. Our forces should've overwhelmed their make-shift defenses long ago, but we underestimated their will to live. Seek my officers in the field, Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael and get them to report on the situation.Send Them Packing^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Explorer Abigail^Explorer Abigail^^Two Wrongs...^^Explorer Abigail has asked you to /raise your hand at 10 Abandoned Pack Mules and then return to her at Westguard Keep.^I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the Whisper Gulch to the north. Most of the Explorers' League went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered. That doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules! If you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure.The Hermit of Witch Hill^36^Horde^Dustwallow Marsh^Draz'Zilb^"Swamp Eye" Jarl^The Hermit of Witch Hill^^^Speak with "Swamp Eye" Jarl at Swamplight Manor.^The marsh seems to have a strange effect on humans. Some grow mad simply by living here. Anyone who has ever settled at Swamplight Manor has gone mad in a spectacular way. The latest owner, one "Swamp Eye" Jarl, is already showing signs. I don't completely understand what's happening there, you'd have my thanks for looking into it. The manor is at the eastern edge of the swamp. Trek east across Bluefen and past North Point Tower. The manor is in a haunted patch of land called Witch Hill.Let Them Eat Crow^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Pontius^Pontius^Let Them Eat Crow^^^Pontius, the kennel keeper at Vengeance Landing, wants you to use the Plaguehound Cage to summon a Hungry Plaguehound and feed it Crow Meat from Fjord Crows west of Vengeance Landing.^The high executor wants me to use my dogs to sniff out enemy scouts, but I can tell you right now these plaguehounds aren't going anywhere until they're properly fed. If our military doesn't understand that these beasts are picky enough to not eat the rubbish they've given me, then they can't expect them to be of any use in the field. You seem to have some time on your hands, why don't you take one of these dogs out hunting for crows out west? Their meat isn't very tasty to us, but my boys love it!Hell Has Frozen Over...^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Macalroy^Vice Admiral Keller^Hell Has Frozen Over...^^^Speak with Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port.^Fordragon's got another thing coming if he thinks the group of green-gilled scrubs he sent to defend this port can hold out much longer. <Macalroy raises an eyebrow as he examines your equipment.> You, however, might fare a bit better. The importance of holding this port cannot be stated enough; and with those monsters flying overhead, the situation around here has gone from bad to worse. Report to Vice Admiral Keller just northwest of here and let him know that you're all out of bubble gum.The Windrunner Fleet^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^High Executor Anselm^Captain Harker^War is Hell^^^Speak to Bat Handler Camille at Vengeance Landing and obtain passage to the Windrunner. Report to Captain Harker aboard the ship.^We have the Windrunner, the Queen's Reprisal and the Oblivion stationed just east of the Derelict Strand. Send orders to the fleet's commander, Captain Harker, that they're to destroy the Alliance's cannons. Speak to our bat handler, Camille, and ask for passage to the fleet's location. Be quick, <name>, every minute we spend fighting the Alliance is a minute we could've spent fighting Arthas.Ambushed!^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Captain Harker^Captain Harker^War is Hell^^^Captain Harker aboard the Windrunner wants you to kill 15 North Fleet Marines.^This should have been a walk in the park. Their forces are hungry, injured and ill equipped. Yet somehow, we walked right into their trap. We approached these reefs from the south to gain cover and were immediately boarded by the Alliance dogs. I'm sorry to say, if you want our cannons to fire at anything, you're going to have to help us take our ships back.Of Keys and Cages^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Father Levariol^Father Levariol^Of Keys and Cages^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^^Father Levariol has asked you to collect enough Gjalerbron Cage Keys to free 10 Gjalerbron Prisoners. Return to him at Westguard Keep when you manage to do so.^The captain may not care, but from the little we know, the vrykul are conducting heinous rites in some sort of 'awakening' ritual up north in Gjalerbron. They're using living sacrifices to fuel their unholy rituals! <class>, you must put a stop to this! It matters not who or what is in those cages, they must be freed. I'd bet that the vrykul hold the keys. The Light knows the last thing we need is more of those strange vrykul walking about, or worse yet, them wakening something even more evil!Guide Our Sights^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Captain Harker^Dark Ranger Lyana^War is Hell^^^Use the Smoke Flares at the location of the Alliance Cannons on the northern wall of the Derelict Strand. Report to Dark Ranger Lyana at the Bleeding Vale after you've completed this task.^We should be able to kill our way back to our guns. Unfortunately, visibility is less than desirable so you will have to mark our targets from the ground. Take these smoke flares with you and use them to mark the locations of the cannons along the northern wall in the Derelict Strand, west of here, where the Alliance are holding out. Let Lyana know as soon as the way is clear for the ground troops. We can take care of ourselves over here.Landing the Killing Blow^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Dark Ranger Lyana^Dark Ranger Lyana^War is Hell^^^Dark Ranger Lyana south of the Vengeance Landing wants you to kill Captain Olster, Lieutenant Celeyne, and Sergeant Lorric at the Derelict Strand.^You've proven yourself in the field of battle, <name>. You might very well have changed the tides in our favor. I've an important assignment for you now. I'm not sure how much longer the weakness we've exposed is going to last, so we must use the element of surprise to our advantage. I want you to use the confusion created by our attack and go behind enemy lines to assassinate their leaders. In order of rank, they are: Captain Olster, Lieutenant Celeyne and Sergeant Lorric. Good luck, <class>.Report to Anselm^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Dark Ranger Lyana^High Executor Anselm^War is Hell^^A Score to Settle^Report back to High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord.^Let's send word back to old Anselm then. Victory has come later than expected, but better late than never. Tell him it will take our forces a few hours at most to finish off the stragglers here. Glory to the Banshee Queen!Dealing With Gjalerbron^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Captain Adams^Dealing With Gjalerbron^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^The Slumbering King^Captain Adams has asked you to kill 15 Gjalerbron Warriors, 8 Gjalerbron Rune-casters, and 8 Gjalerbron Sleep-watchers. Afterward, return to him at Westguard Keep.^And now we have a different problem. My scouts that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul are up to no good at their main fortress to the north. They call the place Gjalerbron, though you'd pronounce the 'Gj' as if it were an 'Sh'. Odd creatures. But that's not important; what is, is that you get up there and put an end to the lives of as many of those creatures as you can while trying to figure out what they're up to. I know that I can count on you, <name>.Necro Overlord Mezhen^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Captain Adams^Dealing With Gjalerbron^^^Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. Then, return to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.^The Scourge are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them! They must be working to bring the vrykul into Arthas' fold. I want the leader of these necrolords eliminated! Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized. I will not see the vrykul successfully allied with the Scourge! Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron.Gjalerbron Attack Plans^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Gjalerbron Attack Plans^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Gjalerbron Attack Plans^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^^Deliver the Gjalerbron Attack Plans to Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep.^These plans detail an imminent attack upon Westguard Keep. It would appear that the frost wyrm, Glacion, who circles overhead is to be used for the offensive. Surely Mage-Lieutenant Malister would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to him at the keep to the south.The Frost Wyrm and its Master^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Gjalerbron Attack Plans^^^Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. Then, return with the horn to Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep.^You were right to bring this to me, <name>. You must take help back north with you to Gjalerbron and slay that wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile! Even now, as we speak here, the frost wyrm may be on its way. However, if I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it! And <name>, please bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands.In Service to the Light^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Father Levariol^Father Levariol^Of Keys and Cages^^Sleeping Giants^Slay 10 Deathless Watchers, 4 Fearsome Horrors, and 2 Putrid Wights. Afterward, inform Father Levariol at Westguard Keep of your success.^Your service has been exemplary, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: the Scourge. The Light cannot abide their presence, and neither shall we. I hope that it is not asking you too much, but I would have you return north to Gjalerbron and crush the unholy Scourge in that vile lair! Be sure to check for them in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron as well. Purification is the key to salvation, my child. Make us proud!Leader of the Deranged^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Sapper Steelring^Sapper Steelring^Danger! Explosives!^^My Daughter, See to the Operations^Slay Squeeg Idolhunter and then report back to Sapper Steelring at Westguard Keep.^So, I hate to say it, pal, but while you were out, the captain took a keener interest in that place. Looks like he wants my old Explorers' League boss in there dead. My guess would be that we're gearing up for an offensive to clear out the rest of them, and the captain wants their head lopped off, as it were. Do me a favor? Head back into Whisper Gulch and put an end to Squeeg Idolhunter. From what I remember, my guess would be that he's in the cave in the northwest corner.Trail of Fire^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Hanes^Apothecary Lysander^^^^Escort Apothecary Hanes out of the Derelict Strand. Report to Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord when you've completed this task.^Thanks for bailing me out of this mess, <name>. I was not looking forward to what these Alliance scumbags had in store for me. Let's get out of here and see if we can get back at them somehow. Is that a campfire over there?If Valgarde Falls...^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Vice Admiral Keller^Vice Admiral Keller^Hell Has Frozen Over...^^^Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord wants you to slay 12 Dragonflayer Invaders or Dragonflayer Worgs.^If Valgarde falls, our primary supply line into Northrend will cease to exist. From there it'll only be a matter of time before we're all servants of the Lich King. Now I don't know about you, but I've got a wife and three kids back in Elwynn and I'll be damned if I'll go down without a fight. The situation here is critical and we can use all the manpower you're able to muster. Get to the front gate and help the guards defend the city against the invading monsters!Rescuing the Rescuers^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Vice Admiral Keller^Vice Admiral Keller^Hell Has Frozen Over...^^Fresh Legs, Into Utgarde!, The Human League, The Shining Light, Into the World of Spirits, The Path to Payback^Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord wants you to rescue 8 Valgarde Scouts that have been impaled and left for dead.^We'd been here for a month when those malformed giants appeared out of thin air. We were ill-prepared for any sort of attack and paid dearly for our complacency. An entire archaeology team was lost and several townsfolk were abducted and taken to the ruins. We've been on the defensive ever since. To make matters worse, the scouts we sent to rescue our people have been harpooned by the vrykul and left for dead in the forest directly north of Valgarde. Dislodge those harpoons and free our scouts!Towers of Certain Doom^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Westguard Sergeant^Westguard Sergeant^^Operation: Skornful Wrath^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^The Westguard Sergeant has informed you that using the Sergeant's Flare to target all four of the towers at Skorn for cannon volleys would be advisable.^<Sir /Ma'am>, as we move through Skorn, we have to bring down those towers! If you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom for us! However, we do have it within our means to call in cannon volleys from Westguard Keep. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them. Just don't get too close!Gruesome, But Necessary^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Westguard Sergeant^Westguard Sergeant^^Operation: Skornful Wrath^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^The Westguard Sergeant has asked you to use The Sergeant's Machete to dismember 20 Vrykul of the Winterskorn tribe at Skorn.^We've had reports that these vrykul can rise from the dead; not unlike the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath. Let's not take any chances. Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, you'll need to carve up the remains of the vrykul that we take down. I'd do it, but I have a sensitive stomach. <The sergeant smirks.> I spent all morning sharpening it, so it should do the job.Burn Skorn, Burn!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Westguard Sergeant^Westguard Sergeant^^Operation: Skornful Wrath^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^The Westguard Sergeant has orders that you should use the Sergeant's Torch to set fire to the Northeast and Northwest Longhouses and the Barracks at Skorn.^Captain Adams gave me strict instructions to make sure that a good deal of infrastructure damage was inflicted on this site. However, since you're in charge out here, that's at your discretion, <sir /ma'am>. May I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn? All we have to do is get inside each and throw this torch.Operation: Skornful Wrath^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Westguard Sergeant^Absholutely... Thish Will Work!^^Towers of Certain Doom, Gruesome, But Necessary, Burn Skorn, Burn!, Stop the Ascension!^Captain Adams has asked you to use the Westguard Command Insignia at Skorn, and then to speak with the Westguard Sergeant.^<name>, I must now ask you to undertake an operation so hazardous, so deadly, that only you can see it through. The vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits on our eastern border. My scouts inform me that those 'giants' are poised to strike us, and with my forces scattered all over the fjord, I don't have the men to take the place by force. Instead, you're going to use your cunning. I've sent a sergeant ahead with the details. Show this command insignia at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and follow your orders.Stop the Ascension!^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Vrykul Scroll of Ascension^Father Levariol^^Operation: Skornful Wrath^^Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near the Thane's Pyre to call him out and slay him. Afterward, due to the nature of the ritual, you're sure that Father Levariol at Westguard Keep will be interested in seeing the scroll.^This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual. A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background. A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Westguard Sergeant^Captain Adams^^Towers of Certain Doom, Gruesome, But Necessary, Burn Skorn, Burn!^Of Keys and Cages, Dealing With Gjalerbron, Gjalerbron Attack Plans, Down to the Wire, I'll Try Anything!, Everything Must Be Ready^Return the Westguard Command Insignia to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.^We -- well, you -- have done everything that we were sent here to accomplish <sir /ma'am>. I must say that it's been a pleasure taking orders from such a fine, young <race>. The captain is sure to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I am at your disposal.Fresh Legs^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Scout Valory^Defender Mordun^Fresh Legs^Rescuing the Rescuers^^Scout Valory wants you to investigate the sounds of battle coming from the northeast of Wyrmskull Village.^It's come at great cost, but we've completed our inspection of the site. The news isn't good. Nearly everyone has been slain or captured. Only a few veteran guards remain unaccounted for. The scouts have done all we can here. You must pick up where we've left off. Sounds of a skirmish are coming from up the hill to the northeast. Have a look, <class>. We can only hope there are some who have survived, and that they may have some intel we can use against this enemy.Into Utgarde!^71^Alliance^Utgarde Keep^Defender Mordun^Vice Admiral Keller^Fresh Legs^Rescuing the Rescuers^^Defender Mordun has tasked you with the execution of Ingvar the Plunderer who resides deep in Utgarde.^Listen up, youngster. I've put down me share of these creatures - and your share too fer that matter. Here be what ya need to know.... The vrykul are fearless in a fight. Seems they actually yearn fer a death in battle. With their numbers and that ferocity, we're doomed - plain and simple. There's one they esteem though, goes by the name of Ingvar. I dunno why they be seekin' his praise, but bring him down and you'll deal a mighty blow to their spirit. Then, perhaps, we'll have a chance....Sniff Out the Enemy^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Pontius^Dragonskin Scroll^Let Them Eat Crow^^^Use the Plaguehound Leash near the plaguehound cages at Vengeance Landing and look for clues at the location you're led to by the Plaguehound Tracker.^Now that this rascal's belly's full, maybe he will be more willing to cooperate. Here's his leash, just come get him from his cage whenever you're ready to take him. I don't know what Anselm expects you to find, but look for clues wherever it is that the dog takes you.The Dragonskin Map^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Dragonskin Scroll^High Executor Anselm^Let Them Eat Crow^^^Bring the Dragonskin Map to High Executor Anselm in Vengeance Landing.^Upon closer inspection, the scroll appears to be a heavily-illustrated map of the fjord. The location of various villages are depicted in what seem to be tribal symbols. The location of Vengeance Landing is marked with a disproportionately large skull. This map will almost certainly be of military value to High Executor Anselm.Prisoners of Wyrmskull^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Vice Admiral Keller^Vice Admiral Keller^Hell Has Frozen Over...^^^Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord wants you to rescue 3 Captured Valgarde Prisoners.^This battle is far from over, <name>. If our people are still alive inside that village, someone has to go and get 'em. <Vice Admiral Keller nods at you.> Head north and enter Wyrmskull Village. Once there, look for our people. If they are imprisoned you'll need to find a way to break them out. Maybe they'll have some more information about what it is that we're actually fighting.Skorn Must Fall!^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chieftain Ashtotem^Winterhoof Brave^^Mimicking Nature's Call^Gruesome, But Necessary, Burn Skorn, Burn!, Towers of Certain Doom, Stop the Ascension!^Chieftain Ashtotem has asked you to use the Winterhoof Emblem at Skorn, and then to speak with the Winterhoof Brave.^<name>, the vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits to the south. Its strange giants have recently awakened and have begun to spread, attacking us wherever they can. My scouts inform me that they are poised to strike at us here, but I do not have the strength to repel such a force. Instead, we will prepare to leave north to less dangerous lands. I ask that you use your cunning to buy us time. I've sent a brave ahead with the details. Show this emblem at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and do all he can to aid you.Gruesome, But Necessary^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Winterhoof Brave^Winterhoof Brave^^Skorn Must Fall!^The Conqueror of Skorn!^The Winterhoof Brave has asked you to use The Brave's Machete to dismember 20 Vrykul of the Winterskorn tribe at Skorn.^Our elders say that these vrykul may be able to rise from the dead; not unlike the walking dead you call the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath. We should not take any chances. Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, carve up the remains of the vrykul that we slay. I spent the morning sharpening it, so it should cleave even through their thick bones.Burn Skorn, Burn!^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Winterhoof Brave^Winterhoof Brave^^Skorn Must Fall!^The Conqueror of Skorn!^The Winterhoof Brave suggests that you use the Brave's Torch to set fire to the Northeast and Northwest Longhouses and the Barracks at Skorn.^Chieftain Ashtotem ordered me to destroy many buildings here. However, you are in charge, so it falls to your hands, <name>. I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn. All we have to do is get inside each and set them ablaze with this torch.Towers of Certain Doom^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Winterhoof Brave^Winterhoof Brave^^Skorn Must Fall!^The Conqueror of Skorn!^The Winterhoof Brave has informed you that using the Brave's Flare to target all four of the towers at Skorn for air strikes would be advisable.^As we move through Skorn, we must destroy the towers. If you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom. However, we can call in wind rider air strikes from Camp Winterhoof. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them. Just don't get too close.Stop the Ascension!^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Vrykul Scroll of Ascension^Greatmother Ankha^^Skorn Must Fall!^Of Keys and Cages^Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near the Thane's Pyre to call him out and slay him. Afterward, due to the nature of the ritual, you're sure that Greatmother Ankha at Camp Winterhoof will be interested in seeing the scroll.^This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual. A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background. A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.The Conqueror of Skorn!^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Winterhoof Brave^Chieftain Ashtotem^The Conqueror of Skorn!^Gruesome, But Necessary, Burn Skorn, Burn!, Towers of Certain Doom^Gjalerbron Attack Plans, Find Sage Mistwalker^Return the Winterhoof Token to Chieftain Ashtotem at Camp Winterhoof.^You have done everything that we were sent here to do, <class>. I must admit that you fight well. Your people are not as strange as I first thought. Chieftain Ashtotem is certain to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I will continue to fight at your side.Ingvar Must Die!^71^Horde^Utgarde Keep^Dark Ranger Marrah^High Executor Anselm^^^^Dark Ranger Marrah has asked you to kill Ingvar the Plunderer in Utgarde Keep, then bring his head to High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing.^Finally, someone's come. I've been here far too long and my wits are beginning to fail me. Of our entire recon party, only I remain. I shall give you my report and it will be up to you to act upon the information. Know this, <class>; it did not come cheaply. These vrykul are relentless fighters. Given their numbers and their savage tactics, our only hope is to bring down their leader and pray it brings chaos to their ranks. Ingvar is his name. Bring his head to Anselm when your duty is done.Dealing With Gjalerbron^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chieftain Ashtotem^Chieftain Ashtotem^The Conqueror of Skorn!^^The Slumbering King^Chieftain Ashtotem has asked you to kill 15 Gjalerbron Warriors, 8 Gjalerbron Rune-casters, and 8 Gjalerbron Sleep-watchers. Afterward, return to him at Camp Winterhoof.^My longrunners that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul have awakened at their main fortress to the west. It is a forbidden place known as Gjalerbron. The longrunners tell me that the vrykul are performing strange rituals. We cannot allow this to continue. Are you willing to continue to assist us? Will you kill the vrykul at Gjalerbron before they finish whatever they are doing and attack us here?Necro Overlord Mezhen^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chieftain Ashtotem^Chieftain Ashtotem^The Conqueror of Skorn!^^^Kill Necro Overlord Mezhen. Then, return to Chieftain Ashtotem at Camp Winterhoof.^The dead ones are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them? We must eliminate the leader of these necrolords. Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized. We cannot afford to see the vrykul successful in whatever they are doing with these undead creatures! Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron.Of Keys and Cages^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Greatmother Ankha^Greatmother Ankha^Of Keys and Cages^Stop the Ascension!^Sleeping Giants^Greatmother Ankha has asked you to collect enough Gjalerbron Cage Keys to free 10 Gjalerbron Prisoners. Return to her at Camp Winterhoof when you manage to do so.^From the little we know, the vrykul are conducting unnatural rites in an 'awakening' ritual to the west in Gjalerbron. They're using living sacrifices to fuel their rituals. <name>, you must stop this. It matters not who or what is in those cages, they must be freed. I would guess that the vrykul hold the keys. The last thing we need is more of those strange vrykul threatening us, or worse, them wakening something even more evil....Gjalerbron Attack Plans^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Gjalerbron Attack Plans^Celea Frozenmane^Gjalerbron Attack Plans^The Conqueror of Skorn!^^Deliver the Gjalerbron Attack Plans to Celea Frozenmane at Camp Winterhoof.^These plans detail an imminent attack upon Camp Winterhoof. It would appear that the frost wyrm, Glacion, who circles overhead, is to be used for the offensive. Surely Celea Frozenmane would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to her at the camp to the east.The Frost Wyrm and its Master^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Celea Frozenmane^Celea Frozenmane^Gjalerbron Attack Plans^^^Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. Then, return with the horn to Celea Frozenmane at Camp Winterhoof.^Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my wind riders cannot fight a dragon. You must take help back west with you to Gjalerbron and slay the frost wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile! Even now it may be on its way! If I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it! And <name>, bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands!The Walking Dead^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Greatmother Ankha^Greatmother Ankha^Of Keys and Cages^^^Slay 10 Deathless Watchers, 4 Fearsome Horrors, and 2 Putrid Wights. Afterward, inform Greatmother Ankha at Camp Winterhoof of your success.^Your assistance to us has been tremendous, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: these so-called Scourge. The spirits of the land and air, the waters and the fire below the world, would not abide their presence, but seem to do nothing about them. We will see to it that they are dealt with! Perhaps it is asking too much, but I would have you return west to Gjalerbron and destroy the unnatural Scourge in that vile lair. Be sure to check in the Waking Halls below Gjalerbron as well!Down to the Wire^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Gil Grisert^Gil Grisert^Down to the Wire^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^^Gil Grisert wants you to bring him 10 clumps of Spotted Hippogryph Down.^The vanguard of the Alliance force will be arriving within days. The soldiers will be expecting their winter gear to be prepared, but I've still got more cloaks to make. I've been using spotted hippogryph down for the cloaks' linings, but my stock won't last! You've got to help me, <name>. Captain Adams will have my hide if those cloaks aren't ready in time! Bring me all the down you can find out there. It's dropped to the ground by molting hippogryphs flying over the wilderness around the fort.War is Hell^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^High Executor Anselm^High Executor Anselm^War is Hell^^^High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing wants you to take the Burning Torch and use it to burn 10 of the corpses littered to the west of town.^We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast. The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been. This does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives. In the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time. Take this torch - you're going to make sure that doesn't happen.Hasty Preparations^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Ahota Whitefrost^Ahota Whitefrost^^^^Ahota Whitefrost at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring him 10 clumps of Spotted Hippogryph Down.^The down of the spotted hippogryph is prized by my people and used for everything from fletching to ceremonial clothing. We're making preparations to leave the post, so this is the last chance I'll get to gather it this season. With your help, I'll have enough to make sure everyone has the equipment they need for the long trek into the hills. Conditions worsen very quickly up there and a storm can blow in without warning. The down can be found all over the ground in the area surrounding the post.A Score to Settle^71^Horde^Utgarde Keep^High Executor Anselm^High Executor Anselm^^Report to Anselm^^High Executor Anselm wants you to to go into Utgarde and slay Prince Keleseth.^This elf prince thinks he can come to my town, insult my queen, kill my men and get away with it? He thinks we're going to stand by while the hordes of Utgarde build up to launch an attack? Not in a million years. You're going to walk right into Utgarde and kill him in front of any of these vrykul gorillas that might be watching. I want Arthas to know that we've arrived and we're playing for keeps.The Human League^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Beltrand McSorf^Pulroy the Archaeologist^The Human League^Rescuing the Rescuers^^Search Wyrmskull Village for Pulroy.^We were on the brink of an archaeological breakthrough when those monsters attacked! Sadly, I was the only one to make it back to Valgarde. Now I don't know if my crew is dead or alive, but the artifacts we uncovered on that dig must be found! If you're heading into Wyrmskull Village, will you keep an eye out for my team? If there's any hope of recovering that information, we must pursue it! Search for Pulroy first. He was the last one I saw before I made my escape.Zedd's Probably Dead^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Pulroy the Archaeologist^Zedd^The Human League^^^Search Wyrmskull Village for Zedd.^To whomever finds this journal: These bloodthirsty monsters have taken up residence in the ruins of Wyrmskull. What they want or why they're here is a mystery. In any case, the artifacts are not safe with those beast-men around. Zedd and I made a new discovery while hiding out: a cipher to decode the tablets! Unfortunately Zedd and I were separated late last night. He had the cipher. Tablets were with Glorenfeld and Daegarn. Location unknown... Find Zedd. -PulroyMaking the Horn^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Nokoma Snowseer^Nokoma Snowseer^Making the Horn^^Suppressing the Elements, The Book of Runes, March of the Giants^Nokoma Snowseer at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring her 6 Undamaged Ram Horns.^My people have been hunting the giant yeti of these hills for generations and I will be participating for the first time this year. It will probably be the last before we leave the post forever. To prepare for the hunt, I must fashion a loud horn from the horns of the dire rams that roam the snowy areas near our camp. The elders tell me the sound mimics the mating call of the female yeti, but I have my doubts. Bring me the best dire ram horns you can find, <name>, and I'll select one from among them.And Then There Were Two...^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Zedd^Glorenfeld^The Human League^^^Search the Utgarde Catacombs for Glorenfeld.^There's no sign of the cipher on Zedd. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt: "Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets." Perhaps you should head into the catacombs located just north of here and search for Glorenfeld and Daegarn. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs.The Depths of Depravity^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Glorenfeld^Glorenfeld^The Human League^^^Glorenfeld at the Utgarde Catacombs wants you to collect 10 Wyrmskull Tablets.^They're keepin' Daegarn locked up in a cage at the large fightin' ring nearby. From what I've gathered, the Dragonflayers bring out their prisoners to battle against their most powerful gladiators. They dump the losers in the basement where Scourge necromancers turn 'em into ghoulies! It's horrifying! But first things first! The tablets are strewn about all across this dungeon. Let's get those recovered before you go off tryin' to be a hero.Return to Valgarde^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Glorenfeld^Beltrand McSorf^The Human League^^Trust is Earned, Out of My Element?, Outpost Over Yonder...^Take Glorenfeld's Package to Beltrand McSorf at Valgarde Port.^Tis a shame we lost two of our best dwarves while uncovering these relics. They sacrificed their lives to keep this information safe. <Glorenfeld wraps the cipher and tablets in a tattered cloth.> Take these back to Valgarde. McSorf will know what to do with the find. As for me? I'll be alright on my own. I've gotten this far in one piece!Green Eggs and Whelps^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Plaguebringer Tillinghast^Plaguebringer Tillinghast^Green Eggs and Whelps^^^Plaguebringer Tillinghast has asked you to collect 10 Plagued Proto-Whelp Specimens and deliver them to him at New Agamand.^This new plague that we're working on is wonderful and I think we should expand its testing. How about testing it on proto-whelps?! Just think of the possibilities. The ability to infect not only humanoids, but extend our reach to any creature! Here, I've hoarded an extra plague canister for the right time and place, and you look like the right person. Spray the eggs at Ember Clutch to the northwest, then get specimens from the plagued proto-whelps that hatch.Draconis Gastritis^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Plaguebringer Tillinghast^Plaguebringer Tillinghast^Green Eggs and Whelps^^^Plaguebringer Tillinghast at New Agamand wants you to use Tillinghast's Plagued Meat to attract down a Proto-Drake and observe its reaction to eating the stuff.^Wait, that gives me an idea! What if it didn't kill the whelps because it was sprayed on the outside of their eggs? <name>, we have to get the plague inside of them! I know! I've got some plagued meat here. Take it to the Ember Clutch and get them to eat it! But no, we're thinking too small. Let's get one of the proto-drakes flying overhead to come down and eat it. Yes! Stay close to the meat and observe what happens. Yes, it might attack you, but such is the price of progress.Mimicking Nature's Call^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Nokoma Snowseer^Nokoma Snowseer^Making the Horn^^Skorn Must Fall!^Test the Carved Horn and then return to Nokoma Snowseer at Camp Winterhoof with the results.^The horn has been roughed out, but before I make the traditional carvings, I want to be certain that it will work. Ahota tells me that he tests his horns at the foot of the frozen waterfall to the northeast of the post. Ahota tells me that our hunters have used the acoustics of frozen water in this way for generations. I can't wait to learn more! Will you help me test out the horn? If I've done everything right, you may even attract a yeti, so be prepared! Bring the horn back once you've tested it.A Lesson in Fear^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sergeant Gorth^Sergeant Gorth^Let Them Eat Crow^^Baleheim Bodycount, Baleheim Must Burn!^Gorth wants you to kill Ulf the Bloodletter, Oric the Baleful and Gunnar Thorvardsson and drive the Forsaken Banner through their corpses. Slay Vrykul across the Forsaken blockade until they appear.^When you've been in lots of fight like Gorth, you learn that to beat enemy good you have to make them really scared to die! But these vrykuls not afraid. You kill one and another comes... screaming louder and with a bigger weapon than the one before. Only thing that makes vrykuls afraid is when we kill the biggest and baddest vrykul of all. Go fight the Winterskorn across the blockade until hero vrykuls show up! Then you kill them dead and put queen's flag on corpses. They must learn to fear!Baleheim Bodycount^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sergeant Gorth^Sergeant Gorth^^A Lesson in Fear^The Ambush^Sergeant Gorth wants you to kill 16 Winterskorn Vrykul inside Baleheim.^Them vrykuls just keeps coming and coming out from town west of here. No end in sight! Gorth has an idea. You go INSIDE town and kill them Winterskorn there. THEN they stop coming here!The Yeti Next Door^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Foreman Colbey^Foreman Colbey^^^The Enigmatic Frost Nymphs, The Book of Runes, March of the Giants^Foreman Colbey at Fort Wildervar wants you to defeat Shatterhorn.^Maybe if the sentries won't help me, you will? I'm the foreman of the mine just across the bridge. My men are mining ore for the weapons our expeditionary force will need to carve a path into the Grizzly Hills. A giant yeti has invaded the mine, blocking the tunnel we need to expand! We've tried yelling at him and smoking him out, but nothing's worked. Maybe you could rouse it from its sleep with a meal of meat from the frosthorn rams in the snowy areas around town? Please? We're desperate!Baleheim Must Burn!^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sergeant Gorth^Sergeant Gorth^^A Lesson in Fear^The Ambush^Sergeant Gorth wants you to go to Baleheim and use Gorth's Torch to burn 1 Winterskorn Dwelling, 1 Winterskorn Watchtower, 1 Winterskorn Bridge and 1 Winterskorn Barracks.^Killing the Winterskorns maybe not enough. Maybe we burn their houses too! Uh... and their bridges. We should burn whole town to be safe! You take this torch. Go to Baleheim, to the west, and burn EVERYTHING! That teach them good.The Artifacts of Steel Gate^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sage Mistwalker^Sage Mistwalker^Find Sage Mistwalker^^^Sage Mistwalker has asked you to collect 10 Steel Gate Artifacts. When you have all of them, return to him at Steel Gate.^I came out here for a different reason; an old friend of mine has been calling to me in my dreams. But now that I see these small things with their machines making a big hole in the ground, it makes my blood boil. From what I can see, these dwarves, as they are known, are digging up artifacts; artifacts that could be important to our past. I want you to go down there and get these things for me. Don't let any of those dwarves stand in your way.Find Sage Mistwalker^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Greatmother Ankha^Sage Mistwalker^Find Sage Mistwalker^The Conqueror of Skorn!^^Greatmother Ankha has asked you to check on the condition of Sage Mistwalker. She believes him to be at or near Steel Gate.^<class>, I grow worried that my son, Sage Mistwalker, has been gone for such a long time. The land is cruel and deadly. He spoke of a recurring vision that he had of a wolf, and went west with a small group of longrunners to seek its source. I believe the name of the place he mentioned was Steel Gate. Will you find him? I want to make sure that no ill has befallen him.The Shining Light^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Ares the Oathbound^Ares the Oathbound^The Shining Light^Rescuing the Rescuers^^Ares the Oathbound in the Utgarde Catacombs wants you to recover the Sacred Artifact.^<Ares gasps for air as he tries to speak.> I am an envoy of the Argent Crusade, charged with a sacred duty. Our forces were decimated in the Plaguelands. By the light of dawn, the artifact was cleansed and made pure once more. So many perished in the wake of its redemption. There is still a chance... still time. The artifact was hurled into the den of the fallen, far below us. Guarded by the unmerciful dead. <Ares' body glows with blinding light.> Light. Will. Protect. You.Guided by Honor^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Ares the Oathbound^Lord Irulon Trueblade^The Shining Light^^^Return the Sacred Artifact to Lord Irulon Trueblade at Valgarde.^<Ares smiles.> Glory to the Light. You have done it! <Ares coughs.> Take the artifact and return it to Valgarde. Lord Irulon Trueblade awaits its return. Fight with honor, friend. Always. Honor. <Ares dies.>Dragonflayer Battle Plans^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Vice Admiral Keller^Vice Admiral Keller^Hell Has Frozen Over...^^^Vice Admiral Keller at Valgarde Port in the Howling Fjord has asked that you bring him the Dragonflayer Battle Plans.^While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of Ingvar, we do know that Yanis resides in a cave next to the worg pit inside Wyrmskull Village. Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards Dragonflayer battle plans. I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any vrykul that get in your way - including Yanis!To Westguard Keep!^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Vice Admiral Keller^Captain Adams^Hell Has Frozen Over...^^^Take the Dragonflayer Battle Plans to Captain Adams at Westguard Keep in the Howling Fjord.^<Vice Admiral Keller rolls up the battle plans.> We've got all the information we need to keep Valgarde protected. You must take these battle plans to Westguard Keep, located on the western fjord cliff wall. Speak with the flight master assistant, Emilune Winterwind. She will put you on the back of a gryphon headed towards Westguard. Once there, find Captain Adams. He's the one in charge. Adams will know what to do with these plans.Preying Upon the Weak^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Trapper Jethan^Trapper Jethan^^Everything Must Be Ready^^Trapper Jethan at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him 8 pieces of Trapped Prey.^Glad to meet you. I've come here from the Grizzly Hills to do business with your cohorts. My people maintain a large outpost there, and you'd do well to visit it when you head north. I've set up traps in the woodlands and snowy areas around here. With the meat and the furs from the creatures they capture, I'll have plenty to barter with the townspeople. I can offer you a share of my profits if you're willing to help gather prey from the traps. Beware though, you won't be the only predator out there.The Offensive Begins^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^High Executor Anselm^Sergeant Gorth^Let Them Eat Crow^^^Speak to Sergeant Gorth at the blockade near the elevator west of Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord.^No one seems to know very much about the vrykul. Our records show no signs of activity in their lands for centuries. Yet here they are, just as we move against Arthas. The map you retrieved makes it clear that we'll have to defeat them if our forces are to get any further into Northrend. One of my best sergeants, an abomination known as Gorth, oversees the blockade beyond the lift. Assist him in launching a pre-emptive strike on Baleheim. If a vrykul attack occurs, it will be launched from there.Rivenwood Captives^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Longrunner Skycloud^Longrunner Skycloud^^^^Longrunner Skycloud has asked you to free his 7 Winterhoof Longrunners. Once you have managed to do so, return to him at Steel Gate.^Something, most likely the walking dead known as the Scourge, has agitated the creatures hereabouts. While escorting the sage here, we lost most of our hunting force to the riven widows -- huge and deadly spiders, which inhabit the Rivenwood to the north. I must stay here to protect the small force we have left, but you... you could see if my longrunners are still alive, trapped within the riven widow's cocoons. Would you do this, stranger?Keeping Watch on the Interlopers^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Junat the Wanderer^Apothecary Malthus^Keeping Watch on the Interlopers^Suppressing the Elements^^Speak to Apothecary Malthus at the Apothecary Camp.^Even the earth cannot hold back the tide of death washing over it. Corpses walk the land, spreading their putrefaction with alarming speed. A small expedition has made its way up the western cliffs and rests near Whisper Gulch. Take a look for yourself, <name>. See if you can learn their purpose and dissuade them from bringing their poisons into our lands. Travel southwest from the post, toward the cliffs overlooking the western beach. Their camp will be west of the excavation at Steel Gate.What's in That Brew?^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Malthus^Apothecary Malthus^Keeping Watch on the Interlopers^^^Apothecary Malthus at the Apothecary Camp wants you to bring him 5 Dwarven Kegs.^To the southeast is an area called Whisper Gulch. It's overrun with members of the Explorers' League who've gone mad! They attacked our caravan as it passed through the area, and they've harried our foraging parties as well. I must know what's causing this madness! I suspect that whatever they're drinking from the kegs scattered around the gulch contributes to their insanity. I want you to steal the kegs from those dwarves while they're busy mining away.The Ring of Judgement^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Glorenfeld^Daegarn^The Human League^^^Find Daegarn in the Ring of Judgement located inside the Utgarde Catacombs.^You might have already seen the room where Daegarn is being held while you were gatherin' the tablets. It's through this corridor and then down a set of steps. Daegarn will be in the room at the bottom of the steps - locked up tight! Get down there and find him. At the very least you might be able to get the cipher from him.Stunning Defeat at the Ring^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Daegarn^Glorenfeld^The Human League^^^Defeat the gladiators at the Ring of Judgement and face Oluf the Violent. Defeat Oluf and recover the Ancient Cipher.^Oluf will come out if you defeat the other gladiators. That's 'bout the only way we're getting' that cipher back. Put on your whompin' boots and get busy in the Ring of Judgement. If you do manage to get the cipher back, return it to Glorenfeld o'er near the entrance to these catacombs. Me? Don't worry about me! We're on the brink of discovering the missing link to human-kind!Brains! Brains! Brains!^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Grick^Apothecary Grick^^^^Apothecary Grick at the Apothecary Camp wants you to bring him 12 Deranged Explorer Brains.^Has Malthus drawn you in with his blather about beer kegs and crazy dwarves? I'm not questioning that the dwarves are crazy, but I don't think stealing their beer is going to do any good. What we need is brains. Lots of brains. We'll get down to the bottom of this mystery in no time, and perhaps even find a new component for the plague. Take this saw, go southeast into the Whisper Gulch, and kill yourself some dwarves. Use the saw to help you harvest the brains and bring them back here.The Enigmatic Frost Nymphs^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Lieutenant Maeve^Lurielle^The Enigmatic Frost Nymphs^The Yeti Next Door^Spirits of the Ice^Speak with Lurielle at the Frozen Glade.^When we first scouted locations for the fort, we encountered hostile creatures at two of the glades here in the north. When we passed the snow-covered one directly south of the town, the dryads there watched us with interest, but did not attack. We were tired and worn down by the weather. They could've easily killed several of our men, but they didn't. Perhaps, in reaching out to them, we might discover unexpected allies. Are you willing to travel to the Frozen Glade and make contact with them?The Ambush^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sergeant Gorth^Lydell^The Ambush^Baleheim Bodycount, Baleheim Must Burn!^^Speak to Lydell at Lydell's Ambush.^The vrykuls in Baleheim is completely defeated, no doubt about it. But still their leader stays in town and won't give up. Gorth sends Lydell and his assassins to make good ambush to the northwest. You talk to Lydell and figure out how to get Vrykul chieftain to come out. Then you kill him. You kill him real good.New Agamand^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Lysander^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^New Agamand^Test at Sea^^Bring Lysander's Strain to Chief Plaguebringer Harris in New Agamand in western Howling Fjord.^I'm afraid our equipment isn't exactly the best here at Vengeance Landing. After all it's a military controlled outpost. I will need you to take a sample of this strain to Chief Plaguebringer Harris in New Agamand, follow the road beyond Baleheim south and then west. They have better equipment there - he will know what to do. You must hurry, <name>. Our enemies are stronger and more numerous than us. We need to develop a viable weapon against them!A Tailor-Made Formula^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^New Agamand^^^Obtain the Dragonflayer Patriarch's Blood from Thorvald at Thorvald's Camp and bring it to Chief Plaguebringer Harris in New Agamand.^We've been spraying down the vrykul village of Halgrind for weeks now and the vrykul just won't drop dead. Let's face it, <name>, by now our Plague has been exposed to humans, dwarves, dogs, livestock... you name it. As our strains adapt to their hosts, more impurities get thrown in the mix. What we need is a strain made custom for the vrykul's biology. Halgrind's chieftain fled the town after we took it over; you'll find him west of here. As a patriarch of the Dragonflayer clan, his blood is ideal.Apply Heat and Stir^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^New Agamand^^^Fill the Empty Apothecary's Flask at the Cauldron of Vrykul Blood, then mix the Flask of Vrykul Blood with Harris's Plague Samples nearby until you've obtained a Balanced Concoction.^You've done well so far, <name>. I'd like to teach you some of my more advanced techniques, so that you gain a better understanding of the plague. Take this empty flask and fill it with blood from the cauldron to my left. Mix it with the plague samples to my right until you obtain a well balanced mix.Field Test^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^New Agamand^^^Venture into Halgrind and use the Plague Spray on 10 Plagued Dragonflayer Vrykul. Return to Chief Plaguebringer Harris to report the results.^Now that we have a strain of the plague that has adapted to vrykul carriers, we really ought to test it on our specimens in Halgrind. If all goes according to plan, they will disintegrate immediately as the plague devours their innards! You will find Halgrind north of here. Our plaguebringers are deploying the previous strain there - shouldn't be hard to spot.Time for Cleanup^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^"Hacksaw" Jenny^New Agamand^^^Speak to "Hacksaw" Jenny in New Agamand.^Being the practical man that I am, I'm going to declare our research here a success. After all, what army can't be stopped by turning its rank and file against each other? I will send word of our achievements to Vengeance Landing soon enough. But first I need you to take care of cleaning up our experimentation site. See "Hacksaw" Jenny about making you a custom abomination. One packing some explosive power if you catch my drift.Parts for the Job^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^"Hacksaw" Jenny^"Hacksaw" Jenny^New Agamand^^^"Hacksaw" Jenny in New Agamand wants you to obtain 6 Shoveltusk Ligaments and 1 Fresh Pound of Flesh.^So Harris wants a demolition job, eh? Yeah, I can help out. You're gonna have to get me some parts, though. I can't afford to use up my choice components on something that's gonna get blown up. First of all, I'm going to need shoveltusk ligaments... way better than the human kind. I will also need a pound of flesh. A fellow known as Anton sells cheap meat. He travels up and down the road to the west.Warning: Some Assembly Required^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^"Hacksaw" Jenny^"Hacksaw" Jenny^New Agamand^^^Use the Abomination Assembly Kit in Halgrind and round up plagued Vrykul with your Mindless Abomination. Slay at least 20 and return to "Hacksaw" Jenny in New Agamand when you're done.^Well, here you are! Our friend's going to be somewhat... unstable. So I suggest not putting him together until reaching Halgrind. Once you're there, use the abomination to round up as many vrykul as you can before self-destructing. Come back with whatever's left once you're done. I can always use more body parts!Suppressing the Elements^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Wind Tamer Kagan^Wind Tamer Kagan^^Making the Horn^Keeping Watch on the Interlopers^Wind Tamer Kagan at Camp Winterhoof wants you to kill 8 mountain elementals. You may kill either Howling Cyclones or Iceshard Elementals.^If you are to survive here, as we have, you must learn to face the environment's challenges head on. The elements will claim your life if you're not vigilant, as the proliferation of elementals in these northern hills shows. We must cull the elementals one last time before we can leave this place. Are you willing to aid us while we continue to make preparations? You must kill any iceshard elementals or howling cyclones you encounter in the snowy hills surrounding the outpost.The Frozen Glade^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Nokoma Snowseer^Lurielle^The Frozen Glade^^Spirits of the Ice^Speak with Lurielle at the Frozen Glade.^For generations, my people have told tales of frost nymphs cavorting in glades hidden away in the wilderness. I used to search for them as a child, against the advice of my parents, until I nearly froze to death. These days, it isn't necessary to comb the forests for them. They've decided to reveal themselves for reasons I can only guess, but I don't think the change can be ignored. Venture southeast to the Frozen Glade and seek out the nymphs, but beware; you will pass the Twisted Glade on your way.Spirits of the Ice^71^All^Howling Fjord^Lurielle^Lurielle^The Enigmatic Frost Nymphs^^The Fallen Sisters, Wild Vines^Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to bring her 15 Icy Cores.^The ice elementals surrounding our glade were once our companions, but a volatile and destructive force has swept through the land, turning them against us! This is but one of the horrors my sisters and I have endured. We have revealed ourselves to you in the hope that you will help us stave off the decay that has crept into our glades and poisoned our sisters! We've been gathering the cores of the ice elementals and keeping them safe so that one day, we might be able to restore them. Will you help?The Fallen Sisters^71^All^Howling Fjord^Lurielle^Lurielle^^Spirits of the Ice^^Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to use her pendant on 7 Chill Nymphs.^To the southwest was a glade that used to look much like this one. Mysterious forces and alien magics are reshaping the land. The glade has thawed, the sisters living there driven mad by the sudden change. We thought to reach out to them, but they attacked us. I fear many may be beyond saving, but I cannot give up hope. Take my pendant, travel southwest to the Vibrant Glade, and use it to try to free my sisters.Wild Vines^71^All^Howling Fjord^Lurielle^Lurielle^^Spirits of the Ice^^Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to kill 8 Scarlet Ivy.^The sisters who lived in the Vibrant Glade, to the southwest, used to tend to gorgeous beds of scarlet ivy, but the same force that has driven them mad has transformed their beloved ivy. The vines now grasp at the feet of the unwary, or lash at any who approach the glade. Before we can reclaim the glade, the vines must be tamed and uprooted. Clear as much of the ivy as you are able. It has already begun to grow out of control.Spawn of the Twisted Glade^71^All^Howling Fjord^Lurielle^Lurielle^^^Keeper Witherleaf^Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to kill 10 Thornvine Creepers.^The glade to the west has been transformed into a hideous place called the Twisted Glade. Horrible beasts dwell among the trees, stones, and pool of the glade. I cannot guess where the creatures came from or what horrible forces animate them, but they must be dealt with! I fear that if they are allowed to dominate the glade, they will poison it beyond redemption. Clear the glade of these creatures who murdered our sisters.The Cleansing^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sage Mistwalker^Sage Mistwalker^Find Sage Mistwalker^^^Sage Mistwalker at Steel Gate has advised you to cleanse yourself of Your Inner Turmoil through meditation at the Frostblade Shrine.^We braved the Rivenwood because of my troubled dreams concerning my worg life-friend, Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him. But, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way. First, you must cleanse your inner turmoil. There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, northeast of Camp Winterhoof. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain. Meditate there and then return to me.Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers^71^All^Howling Fjord^Lurielle^Lurielle^^^^Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to freeze 8 Spores.^The glade to the northwest, now the Twisted Glade, used to be home to a number of keepers of the glade. Together with the sisters, they saw to the glade's upkeep. When the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous spores that wither healthy greenery. I'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals. Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating.The Cleansing^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Watcher Moonleaf^Watcher Moonleaf^The Cleansing^^^Watcher Moonleaf at Steel Gate has advised you to cleanse yourself of Your Inner Turmoil through meditation at the Frostblade Shrine.^Of late I've had nightmares concerning a worg named Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him. However, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way. But first, you must cleanse your inner turmoil through meditation. There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, far to the northeast. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain. Meditate there to cleanse yourself and then return to me.In Worg's Clothing^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sage Mistwalker^Ulfang^Find Sage Mistwalker^^^Sage Mistwalker has asked you to seek out and help Ulfang in the Rivenwood.^From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood. He is in great danger. I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood. The disguise is weak, relying upon the strange magics of that haunted wood. While it will only convince the worgs, it will allow you to get close to Ulfang. Please, <class>, find and help him.Alpha Worg^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Ulfang^Sage Mistwalker^Find Sage Mistwalker^^^Ulfang has asked you to slay Garwal. Then, return the Worg Disguise to Sage Mistwalker at Steel Gate.^When you've eaten Talonshrike's eyes, you should be able see Garwal and rip out his throat! <race>-thing, seek out and slay Garwal in the western Rivenwood. After you have killed him, go and tell Mistwalker that I am once more the alpha worg!In Worg's Clothing^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Watcher Moonleaf^Ulfang^The Cleansing^^^Watcher Moonleaf has asked you to seek out and help Ulfang in the Rivenwood.^From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood. He is in great danger! I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood. The disguise is weak, relying upon the strange magics of that haunted wood. While it will only convince the worgs, it will allow you to get close to Ulfang. Please, <class>, find and help him.Alpha Worg^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Ulfang^Watcher Moonleaf^The Cleansing^^^Ulfang has asked you to slay Garwal. Then, return the Worg Disguise to Watcher Moonleaf at Steel Gate.^When you've eaten Talonshrike's eyes, you should be able see Garwal and rip out his throat! <race>-thing, seek out and slay Garwal in the western Rivenwood. After you have killed him, go and tell Moonleaf that I am once more the alpha worg!Mission: Package Retrieval^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Scout Knowles^Scout Knowles^Report to Scout Knowles^^^Scout Knowles has asked you to retrieve the Apothecary's Package from inside Halgrind. Once you have it, return to the scout at the Ember Spear Tower.^Well darn, we need some of that plague-stuff. I know! While you were destroying the vats, I happened to spy one of the apothecaries from New Agamand being pulled into Halgrind by the vrykul down in there. Poor fella'. <name>, I'd bet anything that apothecary has the goods on him. Think you could go into Halgrind and retrieve his package?Mission: Forsaken Intel^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Scout Knowles^Peppy Wrongnozzle^Report to Scout Knowles^^Absholutely... Thish Will Work!^Scout Knowles has asked you to deliver the Apothecary's Package to Peppy Wrongnozzle at Westguard Keep.^Right, so I think you should get this stuff over to Peppy Wrongnozzle back at the keep. She's something of an amateur alchemist, but she's the only one we've got. One thing about Peppy; she does love her drink. So, you'll likely find her at the tavern 'soaking up the atmosphere'. I'm sure she'll know what to do.I'll Try Anything!^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Christopher Sloan^Christopher Sloan^I'll Try Anything!^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^^Christopher Sloan at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him 5 Northern Barbfish.^I never want to see another barrel of salted fish as long as I live! Filling barrels day in and day out, and there are still more to be filled! I wish I hadn't used up all that bait I bought from Nat Pagle. Worked like magic, it did. Now I'm lucky if I can catch a fish an hour! I hear the northern barbfish make pretty good bait, but who's crazy enough to dive into a freezing cold lake and hack up the water plants in search of them? Not me... but maybe, just maybe, I can persuade you to...Absholutely... Thish Will Work!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Peppy Wrongnozzle^Peppy Wrongnozzle^Absholutely... Thish Will Work!^Mission: Forsaken Intel^^Peppy Wrongnozzle at Westguard Keep has suggested that you take her Peppy's Special Mix and administer it to the Dragonflayer Vrykul Prisoner to witness its results.^Voila, inshtant plague vacshine! But I sure as heck am not going to try thish on myself. And I know you don't want to be my tesht shubject! Oh, I've got... I've got an idea! We've got a vrykul prishoner being held down in the cells under the keep. Why don't you take thish mix I whipped up down there, and get that giant to drink it ...hic?!You Tell Him ...Hic!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Peppy Wrongnozzle^Captain Adams^Absholutely... Thish Will Work!^^^Peppy Wrongnozzle has suckered you into giving the bad news about the Forsaken plague to Captain Adams. Visit him at Westguard Keep.^Here'sh the deal. I'm not going to the captain with thish news. I'm an amateur alchemist, thish ishn't my job, and I'm on break! Beshides, he'sh a big grumpkin... and you know him better than I do! Sho, jusht go up into the keep and tell him. I'm sure he'll be reashonable about the whole thing ...hic. <Peppy turns back to her drinking.>Mission: Plague This!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Captain Adams^Captain Adams^Absholutely... Thish Will Work!^^^Captain Adams has ordered you to get 5 bomb hits on the Plague Tanks at New Agamand. Do not return to him at Westguard Keep until you have accomplished that.^The Royal Apothecary Society thinks they're going to perfect a new plague to melt us down where we stand?! Not on my watch! Get out to the courtyard and speak with Greer Orehammer. He's got a gryphon and some bombs ready for you. I want you to bomb the plague tanks at New Agamand to smithereens!Into the World of Spirits^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Thoralius the Wise^Thoralius the Wise^Into the World of Spirits^Rescuing the Rescuers^^Thoralius the Wise at Valgarde wants you to find his Reagent Pouch.^While the Explorers' League may discern bits and pieces of the past through their archaeological findings and the Vice Admiral might extract some knowledge of the present through brute force, the truth lies with the spirits. With the proper reagents I am able to see into the spirit world. It is there that the past, present and future of Northrend resides. If you wish to learn more, I will require my reagent pouch. It was lost in a ship that is now at the bottom of Daggercap Bay, just east of here.The Echo of Ymiron^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Thoralius the Wise^Thoralius the Wise^Into the World of Spirits^^^Thoralius the Wise wants you to search Wyrmskull Village while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Wyrmskull.^The spirit world has fallen under the sway of the Lich King. Fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare now stand watch over the realm of the elements. I sense that these val'kyr are guarding a terrible secret. I am too old and weak to survive another journey. You must go in my place, <name>. Take this incense burner to Wyrmskull Village and use it to enter the spirit world. Find the large dwelling in the northeast! Avoid the val'kyr at all costs lest they make you a permanent fixture in their world.Anguish of Nifflevar^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Thoralius the Wise^Thoralius the Wise^Into the World of Spirits^^^Thoralius the Wise wants you to search Nifflevar while you are in the spirit world and find information about the Secrets of Nifflevar.^All that we know of the vrykul indicates that they only recently appeared in Northrend. Why, then, are we seeing vrykul in visions that date back 15,000 years? Surely if the vrykul had previously existed in Northrend we would have known. You must press on to Nifflevar. To get there you must go northeast, through Wyrmskull Village, and take the path leading up through the dam. Nifflevar is on the bluffs of the fjord. Use the incense burner once you arrive at Nifflevar and search the area for clues.The Book of Runes^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Prospector Belvar^Prospector Belvar^The Book of Runes^The Yeti Next Door^^Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him The Book of Runes.^The vast rocky area to the southeast, Giants' Run, has been overrun by Iron Dwarves. Scouts have reported seeing the dwarves coaxing stone giants from the ground, then carving runes on them. I can't fathom their motives, but I suspect they're somehow trying to turn the giants into weapons. The iron rune stonecallers and binders carry large tomes with them, which must contain the runes they're carving on the giants. Capture the pieces of this book, assemble them, and bring it back to me, <name>.The Rune of Command^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Prospector Belvar^Prospector Belvar^The Book of Runes^^^Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis.^Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation. Take it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered. The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run.Mastering the Runes^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Prospector Belvar^Prospector Belvar^The Book of Runes^^^Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar.^I've got a set of picks, hammers, and chisels with me, but they won't work for carving these runes. The tools used by the Iron Dwarves are imbued with magic during their forging. When they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist. I believe I know how it works, but without a set of those tools, I can't be certain. Look for kits resembling mine near the Iron Dwarf pavilions at Giants' Run and bring them to me.The Book of Runes^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Longrunner Pembe^Longrunner Pembe^The Book of Runes^Making the Horn^^Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof wants you to bring him The Book of Runes.^Chieftain Ashtotem dispatched me on a scouting mission to Giants' Run, a broad, rocky plateau to the southeast, past the Frozen Glade. The area has been taken over by Iron Dwarves who seem to be altering the giants as they emerge from the earth. The iron rune stonecallers and binders carry large tomes with them, which must contain the runes they're carving on the giants. Capture the pieces of this book, assemble them, and bring it back to me. It's the only way we'll understand their plans.Mastering the Runes^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Longrunner Pembe^Longrunner Pembe^The Book of Runes^^^Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof.^I think I've figured out what the Iron Dwarves are doing. The tools they use are imbued with magic during their forging. When they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist. If I had a set of those tools, I could mimic the runes in the book. I captured one of these boxes from one of the pavilions at Giants' Run, but it was empty. Look for similar boxes and recover a set of tools from them.The Rune of Command^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Longrunner Pembe^Longrunner Pembe^The Book of Runes^^^Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis.^Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation. Take it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered. The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run.Wanted: Nazan's Riding Crop^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Nazan's Riding Crop. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^Today I have a buyer who is interested in a piece that's held by the mount of Illidan's herald. I, of course, speak of Vazruden the Herald and his dragon mount, Nazan. If you want the finder's fee that I offer in return, find them flying above the Ramparts at Hellfire Citadel and return with the dragon's riding crop. My sources tell me that the item in question is personally held by the dragon. It is said that Nazan refuses to allow Vazruden to strike him with it.March of the Giants^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Researcher Aderan^Researcher Aderan^March of the Giants^The Yeti Next Door^^Researcher Aderan at Fort Wildervar wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants.^To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. What their ultimate destination is, I do not know. The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Use this pick to deactivate the runes on the giants' corpses and return with your findings.The Lodestone^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Researcher Aderan^Researcher Aderan^March of the Giants^^^Researcher Aderan at Fort Wildervar wants you to compare the Rune Sample with the Broken Tablet.^If we can locate what's luring the giants northwest, we might be able to stop them before they reach their destination. Although I was able to decipher many of the runes on the samples you brought me, the ones I don't know concern me the most. When I visited Giants' Run, I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of Frostblade Peak. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn.Demolishing Megalith^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Researcher Aderan^Researcher Aderan^March of the Giants^^^Defeat Megalith and return to Researcher Aderan at Fort Wildervar.^Binder Murdis created Megalith to be the most powerful of the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. After the expeditionary force arrives, our soldiers will be able to isolate and defeat the remaining giants and oust their Iron Dwarf masters from their camps. Search the foothills of Frostblade Peak, north of Giants' Run for Megalith and defeat him!Wanted: Keli'dan's Feathered Stave^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Keli'dan's Feathered Stave. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^There is no accounting for taste. Take my most recent buyer for instance. There is a blood orc within Hellfire Citadel known as Keli'dan the Breaker. He bears a most mundane stave; certainly nothing to take a second glance at. And yet, this is what my customer wishes. Who am I to say no? If you desire my compensation, you will find him and his stave within the Blood Furnace.Wanted: Bladefist's Seal^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Bladefist's Seal. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^Today I have a very wealthy collector in need of something very unique indeed. Warchief Kargath Bladefist carries upon his person his seal of command, which he uses to sign all official documents. I want you to retrieve it for me. You will find him deep within the Shattered Halls. No doubt you will have to wade through a veritable army to get to him. I have no doubt that you will succeed.Wanted: Shattered Hand Centurions^70^All^Shattrath City^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun has tasked you with the deaths of 4 Shattered Hand Centurions. Return to him in Shattrath's Lower City once they all lie dead in order to collect the bounty.^Do you question your master? Neither does Mah'duun. The blood of the centurions of the Shattered Hand clan is what I seek. You will find them within the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel. If you want the bounty, you will not return until you have slain them all.March of the Giants^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sage Edan^Sage Edan^March of the Giants^Making the Horn^^Sage Edan and Camp Winterhoof wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants.^To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. I know nothing of their goals, nor of their destination. The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Fell some of these giants. Take this pick with you and use it on the corpses of the runed stone giants. It will deactivate the runes. Once you've tested enough giants, return to me with your findings.The Lodestone^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sage Edan^Sage Edan^March of the Giants^^^Sage Edan at Camp Winterhoof wants you to compare the Rune Sample with the Broken Tablet.^We must find what's luring the giants northwest, so we can stop them before they reach their destination. While the rune samples gave us some clues, the unknown runes worry me. When I visited Giants' Run, I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of Frostblade Peak. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn about the identity of this lodestone.Demolishing Megalith^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Sage Edan^Sage Edan^March of the Giants^^^Defeat Megalith and return to Sage Edan at Camp Winterhoof.^Binder Murdis created Megalith to be a kind of keystone for the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. I will ask Chieftain Ashtotem to divert some of our men as we move north and dedicate them to eliminating the last of the runed giants. Without their giants, the Iron Dwarves cannot stand against us. Search the foothills of Frostblade Peak, north of Giants' Run for Megalith and defeat him!Wanted: The Heart of Quagmirran^70^All^Coilfang Reservoir^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain The Heart of Quagmirran. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^I have an unusual request. A certain wealthy individual that I am in contact with off-world is interested in a macabre piece. Specifically, she wants the heart of Quagmirran. I hear that the beast has three, but one will suffice for our purposes. As I understand it, you can find Quagmirran resting within a deep pool of water at the Slave Pens.Wanted: A Black Stalker Egg^70^All^Coilfang Reservoir^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem wants you to obtain a Black Stalker Egg. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^There is only ever one great mother of the marsh walkers in Zangarmarsh. She is always known as the Black Stalker, and she hatches from one of the eggs left behind when her mother dies. I have a buyer who is interested in one of those eggs.

Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^While it is known that Warlord Kalithresh of the naga is a great warrior in his own right, there are fewer who know that he has codified all of his knowledge. One of my customers is aware of it though, and is keenly interested in obtaining his treatise. I ask that you travel to the Steamvault in Coilfang Reservoir and obtain this book for me.Wanted: Coilfang Myrmidons^70^All^Coilfang Reservoir^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun has asked you to slay 14 Coilfang Myrmidons. Return to him in Shattrath's Lower City once they all lie dead in order to collect the bounty.^Mah'duun hears and obeys, and I now ask you to be my instrument. It has been related to me that the myrmidons of the coilfang tribe must be destroyed. Seek them out within the humid confines of the Steamvault underneath Coilfang Reservoir. I will accept nothing less than their utter annihilation.Wanted: The Headfeathers of Ikiss^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to acquire The Headfeathers of Ikiss.

Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^Today I have a personal request of you, yet the reward will certainly match the danger. My family has a 'history', shall we say, with Nexus-Prince Shaffar and his followers. If the amulet he wears were to fall into my hands then surely that would mean that he had been dealt with. If the bounty I am offering is of interest to you then journey to his lair within Auchindoun's Mana-Tombs.Wanted: The Exarch's Soul Gem^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to recover The Exarch's Soul Gem. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^Within Auchindoun's Auchenai Crypts many unsavory experiments are undertaken in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the necromantic arts. Many are the spirits that are tortured or destroyed therein. I have a customer who is interested in the liberation of one of those spirits. I have been informed that this spirit is contained within a soul gem held by none other than Exarch Maladaar himself. Seek him out within the crypts with all due haste and return to me with the gem.Wanted: Murmur's Whisper^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Murmur's Whisper. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^When I'm done speaking, you may not want to take this commission. I have an eccentric client who specializes in the study of dead realities. It is rumored that the being known as Murmur destroyed the last world from which he was summoned. The professor is interested in examining his 'whisper' as he called it to understand how it is that Murmur accomplished such a feat. Will you journey to the Shadow Labyrinth within Auchindoun and retrieve it for me?Wanted: Malicious Instructors^70^All^Shattrath City^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to kill 3 Malicious Instructors.

Return to him when it's done.^I'm providing the catering for some unusual party guests tonight. One of these fellows was flying around in Skettis and got knocked to the ground by a monstrous kaliri--his leg was broken badly. They've requested something special for his get well party: Kaliri Stew. I can loan you my cooking pot so you can whip up a batch of stew for me. The recipe itself is simple, but you'll need to get a giant kaliri wing and some cooked warp burgers.Wanted: The Epoch Hunter's Head^70^All^Caverns of Time^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain the Epoch Hunter's Head. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^The tastes of my customers range from the mundane to the exotic. And sometimes they want to do very mundane things with the exotic objects they seek. Such is the case with my latest request. My client, who shall remain nameless, wishes to obtain the head of the Epoch Hunter to mount on his wall. <class>, will you find a way to travel back in time to Old Hillsbrad and procure said head for my trophy-hunting patron?Super Hot Stew^70^All^Cooking^The Rokk^The Rokk^^^^The Rokk in Lower City has asked you to cook up some Demon Broiled Surprise using his cooking pot, two Mok'Nathal Shortribs and a Crunchy Serpent. Return to him when it's done.^I'm trying to invent something with some real zing. But to be honest, I'm more of an idea goblin these days. I've lost my sense of adventure. But you... remind me of my younger days; ready to take on the world with a sword in one hand and a skillet in the other. I want you to take my beloved cooking pot and head out to Blade's Edge. Throw in some shortribs and crunchy serpent--already cooked for extra flavor--and broil it over an abyssal's corpse, the only thing hot enough to do the trick.Manalicious^70^All^Cooking^The Rokk^The Rokk^^^^The Rokk in Lower City has asked you collect 15 Mana Berries from the Eco-Domes in Netherstorm.^Wouldn't you know it, I think my foodstuffs are up to date and someone comes along and requests the unusual: Mana Berry Delight. Unfortunately, mana berries are only found in the eco-domes of Netherstorm. Just don't bother looking around Stormspire--it's picked clean. I could only trust someone trained in the culinary arts to pick the best berries, so don't let me down!Soup for the Soul^70^All^Cooking^The Rokk^The Rokk^^^^The Rokk in Lower City has asked you to cook up some Spiritual Soup using his cooking pot. Return to him when it's done.^Death is in the air. I've never had so many orders for my famous soup--it lifts your spirits and soothes the soul. And I know a fellow cook when I see one! Would you like to help me out and get a cut of the profits? Here, take my cooking pot, gather some clefthoof meat and I'll let you in on a little secret. What makes my soup so good for the soul? It's not chicken--I cook it at the Ancestral Grounds in Nagrand to soak up all that spiritual stuff there.Wanted: Aeonus's Hourglass^70^All^Caverns of Time^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to acquire Aeonus's Hourglass. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^I swear that some of my customers are crazy. There are possessions that you go after, and there are ones that you dare not even think of! My current client is clearly over-the-top insane. He covets the hourglass that Aeonus holds. Yes, you heard right, Aeonus of the Infinite Dragonflight! Who am I to argue since he's paying a king's ransom? So, ready to go to the Caverns of Time and travel to the Black Morass to retrieve it for me?Wanted: Rift Lords^70^All^Caverns of Time^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to kill 4 Rift Lords. Return to him in Shattrath's Lower City once they all lie dead in order to collect the bounty.^Mah'duun knows where you must go. Mah'duun knows that you must kill rift lords. But, Mah'duun does not know exactly when. I know that does not make sense, but the voice on the winds was not more specific. Travel to the Black Morass through the Caverns of Time and the way shall be made clear.Wanted: A Warp Splinter Clipping^70^All^Tempest Keep^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain a Warp Splinter Clipping. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^Not long ago, I was approached by a kaldorei druidess with a touching request. And plenty of gold, of course! It would appear that the forces of Darnassus wish to restore an ancient of the arcane known as Warp Splinter. The giant tree has been confused or corrupted, I'm not certain, but you'll find it inside of the Botanica at Tempest Keep. She said that all they would need to regrow him was a small clipping.Wanted: Sunseeker Channelers^70^All^Tempest Keep^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to kill 6 Sunseeker Channelers.

Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^I always assumed that Pathaleon the Calculator used magic to project his image across Outland. Apparently I was wrong. My latest customer tells me that the blood elf uses a mechanical device for his communication with the leaders of Prince Kael'thas's special projects. As I understand it, he acquired it from the Zaxxis rebels in the Netherstorm. My client wishes to obtain the projector. Why don't you pay Pathaleon a visit? He can be found within the Mechanar at Tempest Keep.Wanted: Tempest-Forge Destroyers^70^All^Tempest Keep^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to destroy 5 Tempest-Forge Destroyers. Return to him in Shattrath's Lower City once they all lie dead in order to collect the bounty.^There are mechanical constructs within the Mechanar which Mah'duun has been told must be dismantled. Go to Tempest Keep, find the tempest-forge destroyers and destroy them. Then you may return to collect the bounty.Wanted: The Scroll of Skyriss^70^All^Tempest Keep^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain The Scroll of Skyriss. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^Today's client seeks something truly unique. It is said that Harbinger Skyriss is a servant of the Old Gods. It is also said that he carries a large scroll that contains their instructions for his domination of life in the universe on their behalf. My current buyer wishes to get <his /her> hands on that scroll, nevermind that <he /she> won't be able to read the language upon it. Travel to Tempest Keep's Arcatraz and get it for me, will you, <class>?Wanted: Arcatraz Sentinels^70^All^Tempest Keep^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to dismantle 5 Arcatraz Sentinels. Return to him in Shattrath's Lower City once that has been accomplished in order to collect the bounty.^The sentinels within the Arcatraz have gone haywire. The prisoners run rampant and the guards attack those that would help. Mah'duun hears the speaker on the nether winds. The speaker says to destroy the sentinels. Accomplish this and today's bounty is yours.I've Got a Flying Machine!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist^Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist^See to the Operations^^^The Steel Gate Chief Archaeologist wants you to transport 3 Sacks of Relics from the bottom of the site and take them to the platform on the north or south side of Steel Gate.^Well, what are you waiting for, there's work to be done!

Yer back for another day's work? Well, alright, here's the keys. We don't need any haulin' today, so just keep an eye out for anything suspicious, okay?

But there are murloc down there, and I fear the worst has befallen them. Surely you have time to see if they're alright? There's a way down to the beach just to the southwest, though watch out for the worgs and other things lurking in the woods.And You Thought Murlocs Smelled Bad!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Explorer Jaren^Explorer Jaren^^^^Explorer Jaren has asked you to kill 15 Scourge of any type along the Chillmere Coast. Return to him once you have done so.^Originally I came down here to investigate some rumors about artifacts to be dug up. I knew that there were murlocs along the coast here, but I never in a million years thought I'd see this. <The explorer pokes his head out to look around the tree.> The Scourge are out there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead! <class>, I think it's our duty to do something about this. Think you could take out a good chunk of those Scourge?It's a Scourge Device^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Scourge Device^Explorer Jaren^It's a Scourge Device^^^Deliver the Scourge Device to Explorer Jaren on the Chillmere Coast.^The Scourge creature you just destroyed had this device held in its clutches. It has a jewel set into it which looks similar to the one that tops the scourging crystals. Surely, Explorer Jaren would like to have a look at this.Bring Down Those Shields^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Explorer Jaren^Explorer Jaren^It's a Scourge Device^^^Explorer Jaren on the Chillmere Coast has asked you to destroy 3 Scourging Crystals.^Look at the button on the side of the controller here. I bet if you got close enough to one of those scourging crystals, you could use the controller to bring its shield down. Then it would simply be a matter of destroying the thing before its shield goes back up. What do you say, <name>? You up for it? I can guarantee a nice reward for you if you can bring down those shields and destroy the crystals. It's the least we can do to keep the Scourge from making more of their own kind.And You Thought Murlocs Smelled Bad!^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Apothecary Anastasia^Apothecary Anastasia^^^^Apothecary Anastasia has asked you to destroy 15 Scourge of any type along the Chillmere Coast. Return to her at the Apothecary Camp once you have done so.^I came here to investigate a rumor about a Scourge presence nearby. I expected murlocs along the coast down below, but I never thought I'd see this! The Scourge are down there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead! <class>, we will not suffer them to create more of their kind, especially not from murlocs! There is a ramp down to the beach just northwest of the camp. See to it that you deal with the Scourge in a timely fashion!It's a Scourge Device^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Scourge Device^Apothecary Anastasia^It's a Scourge Device^^^Deliver the Scourge Device to Apothecary Anastasia at the Apothecary Camp.^The Scourge creature you just destroyed had this device held in its clutches.

I bet if you got close enough to one of those scourging crystals, you could use the controller to bring its shield down. Then it would simply be a matter of destroying the thing before its shield goes back up. Brave enough to hazard another trip down there, <name>? I can guarantee a nice reward for you if you can bring down those shields and destroy the crystals. How can you refuse if it means less Scourge, especially ones made from murlocs?Everything Must Be Ready^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Quartermaster Brevin^Gil Grisert^^All Hail the Conqueror of Skorn!^Preying Upon the Weak^Speak with Gil Grisert at Fort Wildervar.^When the expeditionary force moves north, Captain Adams expects everything to be ready at Fort Wildervar. The scouts and craftsmen there have been tasked with preparing the gear and rations for our men for the climb into the hills. The captain's famous for his temper, so I want to send someone ahead to check on the preparations. Fort Wildervar is far to the northeast, beyond Skorn, up in the snow-covered areas near the border with Grizzly Hills. Find Gil Grisert there and make sure he is prepared.The One That Got Away^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Christopher Sloan^Christopher Sloan^I'll Try Anything!^^^Christopher Sloan at Fort Wildervar wants you to defeat Frostfin.^The barbfish you brought should work well as bait for most fish, but I fear it'll attract a monster! When I first arrived, I put some of Nat Pagle's favorite bait on my hook and cast it into the water. A huge monster latched on, with giant teeth and icicles hanging from its fins! Would've pulled me into those icy waters if I hadn't cut the line! I can't use the new bait until ol' Frostfin's been dealt with. Use this bait near the sunken boat in the middle of the lake. He won't be able to resist!Camp Winterhoof^70^Horde^Howling Fjord^Cormath the Courier^Chieftain Ashtotem^^^^Speak to Chieftain Ashtotem at Camp Winterhoof.^In my travels as a courier, I've seen a number of strange denizens of the Howling Fjord, but one group stands out. From a distance, they look like tauren, but upon closer inspection, they're quite different -- sturdier and shaggier. I found one of their settlements far to the north, beyond Halgrind, Skorn, and the northern forests. Camp Winterhoof, it's called, and it sits in the foothills of Gjalerhorn near the border with Grizzly Hills. Make contact with them, and see if they might be of use to us.Brother Betrayers^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Ulfang^Ulfang^The Cleansing^^^Ulfang has asked you to kill the traitorous worgs, Bjomolf and Varg. Return to him in disguise in the Rivenwood after you have done so.^Watcher Moonleaf is from my dreams! If you are her friend, you are mine. I was alpha male until the last full moon. Then the strange white worg, Garwal, came from the north, and with the help of my once-brothers, he quickly became alpha worg. There is something unnatural about him. To help, you must first kill those who betrayed me. Bjomolf hunts to the northwest of a place called Steel Gate. And look for Varg to the southeast, near the West Spear Tower. They will not be fooled by your form.Brother Betrayers^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Ulfang^Ulfang^Find Sage Mistwalker^^^Ulfang has asked you to kill the traitorous worgs, Bjomolf and Varg. Return to him in disguise in the Rivenwood after you have done so.^Mistwalker is from my dreams! If you are his friend, you are mine. I was alpha male until the last full moon. Then the strange white worg, Garwal, came from the north, and with the help of my once-brothers, he quickly became alpha. There is something unnatural about him. To help, you must first kill those who betrayed me. Bjomolf hunts to the northwest of a place the two-legs call Steel Gate. And look for Varg to the southeast, near the West Spear Tower. They will not be fooled by your form.Eyes of the Eagle^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Ulfang^Ulfang^The Cleansing^^^Ulfang has asked you to collect the Eyes of the Eagle. Return to him in disguise in the Rivenwood after you have done so.^Garwal hides himself behind an unnatural magic. None can see him unless he wants you to. There may be one chance we can take, though. My enemy, the great eagle, Talonshrike, is said to have eyes that can see anything. If you were to take her eyes, then you would surely be able to see Garwal. Talonshrike keeps her nest at the base of a waterfall just to the southwest of the vrykul place called Skorn. If you touch the eggs in her nest, she will come down from the sky to kill you. Get her eyes.Eyes of the Eagle^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Ulfang^Ulfang^Find Sage Mistwalker^^^Ulfang has asked you to collect the Eyes of the Eagle.

Get her eyes.We Call Him Steelfeather^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Gil Grisert^Gil Grisert^Down to the Wire^^^Locate Steelfeather circling Fort Wildervar and use the Feathered Charm to discover his secret. Report your findings to Gil Grisert.^We see one brave hippogryph circling over the fort, then swooping down and taking prey. Jethan over there has taken a couple of shots at the creature, but his arrows bounced right off! We've taken to calling this remarkable creature Steelfeather, but we can't see why he prefers the area around Fort Wildervar. Most hippogryphs are wary of people. Researcher Aderan has helped us fashion a charm from one of the creature's feathers. He claims it will allow the user to see through Steelfeather's eyes.The Path to Payback^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Guard Captain Zorek^Guard Captain Zorek^The Path to Payback^Rescuing the Rescuers^^Guard Captain Zorek at Valgarde in Howling Fjord wants you to recover the Harpoon Operation Manual.^Two weeks ago our chief engineer got his hands on a vrykul harpoon gun - the same type of gun that the vrykul use to take down our ships. By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual. Unfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to Wyrmskull Village. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the Utgarde Catacombs, located at the northwest end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual!It Goes to 11...^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Lieutenant Icehammer^Lieutenant Icehammer^The Path to Payback^^^Lieutenant Icehammer in the Howling Fjord wants you to destroy the Dragonflayer Longhouse, Dragonflayer Dockhouse, Dragonflayer Storage Facility and 8 Dragonflayer Defenders.^We must strike while the vrykul forces are in disarray! Take the harpoon control mechanism to Nifflevar and locate the northernmost harpoon building on the bluff side of the village. Once there, commandeer one of the vrykul harpoon guns that are stationed on the building's deck. Use the harpoon gun to rain hell upon Wyrmskull Village! Destroy the longhouse, dockhouse, storage facility and any defenders that the vrykul may send at you! Do this and Daggercap Bay will become a much safer port!Trident of the Son^71^All^Howling Fjord^Old Icefin^Old Icefin^^^^Old Icefin wants you to obtain Rotgill's Trident. Return it to him on the small island on the Chillmere Coast.^<From the scratches he makes in the rock, you see several symbols: a trident, a mur'ghoul, the sun, a wrecked ship, and a rough stick-figure of yourself.> <Puzzling out what the murloc is conveying takes a while. Obviously he wants you to get a trident from the Chillmere Coast, but the image of the sun is puzzling. That is until you realize he means his son.> <His son was changed into a mur'ghoul! He wants you to find him to the south near the wrecked ship and return with his trident.>The Enemy's Legacy^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Scribe Seguine^Scribe Seguine^^^^Go into Nifflevar, north of Ghostblade Post and look for the Saga of the Winter Curse, the Saga of the Val'kyr and the Saga of the Twins.^As our armies march through Northrend, our enemies will not suffer mere defeat. Their houses will burn, their corpses will be devoured by our plagues, all trace of their existence will be lost. This worries me as a seeker of knowledge. The eastern town of Nifflevar will soon be razed by our forces in Vengeance Landing. The vrykul bard, Helgus, lived there and wrote three sagas: the Saga of the Twins, the Saga of the Winter Curse and the Saga of the Val'kyr. Obtain them before Nifflevar is destroyed.Shield Hill^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^"Hacksaw" Jenny^"Hacksaw" Jenny^^^^"Hacksaw" Jenny wants you to bring her 5 Ancient Vrykul Bones from the reanimated Vrykul in Shield Hill, south of New Agamand.^My work should be extremely easy in a time of war. There ought to be usable body parts everywhere. It's not that simple, though. With these eggheads making all sorts of killer plagues and sending them to enemy towns, most of the material gets contaminated. There is a place, though, where usable samples exist. Shield Hill, south of here, is an ancient vrykul burial ground where the dead walk but are not afflicted with any plague - ours or the Lich King's. Get me some bones, I'll pay ya well.Locating the Mechanism^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Guard Captain Zorek^Guard Captain Zorek^The Path to Payback^^^Guard Captain Zorek at Valgarde in Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Harpoon Control Mechanism.^Don't worry, <name>; this is all going to lead to something big! HUGE! You're just going to have to trust me for now and do as I ask of you. We need to get the mechanism mentioned in the manual for the next step of the plan. I have a strong suspicion that you'll find one on one of those vrykul that operate the harpoon guns in Wyrmskull Village. You'll find them on the east side of the village, on the docks by the longhouses.Meet Lieutenant Icehammer...^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Guard Captain Zorek^Lieutenant Icehammer^The Path to Payback^^^Guard Captain Zorek wants you to take the Harpoon Control Mechanism to Lieutenant Icehammer stationed outside of Nifflevar.^Do you see those vrykul buildings on the bluffs to the northeast? The vrykul call that place Nifflevar. It's where most of their harpoon attacks on our frigates originate. Well guess what? The time for payback has come, <name>. I need you to take this harpoon control mechanism and meet up with Lieutenant Icehammer, who is hiding out in a vrykul building northwest of Nifflevar. When you're ready I'll place you on the back of one of our gryphons and zip you right to him!Keeper Witherleaf^71^All^Howling Fjord^Lurielle^Lurielle^^Spawn of the Twisted Glade^^Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to kill Keeper Witherleaf.^You have been a great friend and ally to us, <name>. There is one more thing I must ask of you. You have seen the corruption of the Twisted Glade and the beasts that dwell there. The blacksouled keepers will continue raising these abominations from the waters and soil of our glade unless we act against them. The most powerful of the blacksouled keepers is known as Keeper Witherleaf. Slay him, <name>, and open the way for the redemption of the glade as you once redeemed my sisters.Drop It then Rock It!^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Lieutenant Icehammer^Lieutenant Icehammer^The Path to Payback^^^Lieutenant Icehammer in the Howling Fjord wants you to place the Alliance Banner in Baleheim and then defend the banner against attackers.^I'm not about to put the fate of this mission into the hands of some untested scrub. Now, if you want to prove to me that you've got what it takes to carry out this mission, you'll need to do what I tell you. Take this battle standard and head over to Baleheim, directly north of here. Once you're at Baleheim, find the center of town and drop our flag. Fight off any vrykul dirt bags that attempt to take down our beloved flag and return to me once you've established Alliance dominance!Harpoon Master Yavus^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Lieutenant Icehammer^Lieutenant Icehammer^The Path to Payback^^^Lieutenant Icehammer in the Howling Fjord wants you to slay Harpoon Master Yavus at Nifflevar.^That was a fairly strong showing at Baleheim, <name>. Before you go off patting yourself on the back there's work to be done at Nifflevar. We've located the vrykul responsible for the majority of the harpoon attacks on our frigates - goes by the name of Yavus. You'll find him in the main harpoon structure on the bluffs of Nifflevar, southeast of here. Track him down and execute him for crimes against the Alliance! Do me proud, <name>!Sleeping Giants^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^Mage-Lieutenant Malister^^In Service to the Light^^Mage-Lieutenant Malister has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. Return to him at Westguard Keep when you have done so.^I've overheard what you've had to say with Father Levariol. Allow me to suggest that he's not having you go far enough. You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron! I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely. Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul.Sleeping Giants^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Ahota Whitefrost^Ahota Whitefrost^^Of Keys and Cages^^Ahota Whitefrost has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. Return to him at Camp Winterhoof when you have done so.^I've overheard what you've had to say with Greatmother Ankha. With all due respect, she's not having you go far enough. You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron! I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely. Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul.Forgotten Treasure^71^All^Howling Fjord^Handsome Terry^Handsome Terry^Pirates of the North Seas^Street "Cred"^Gambling Debt^Handsome Terry at Scalawag Point wants you to bring him 1 Amani Vase and 1 Eagle Figurine from the shipwreck to the south.^I've made my fortune by specializing in treasure that regular pirates don't appreciate: art, antiquities, collector's pieces. Black Conrad's fleet sank south of here years ago. All the gold and jewelry was picked clean by divers, but two ancient relics remain there. One is a museum-quality Amani vase, the other is an eagle figurine. Go and retrieve them for me and I'll vouch for you with the other pirates. I'll even throw in something to make your underwater adventure a bit more manageable.Let's Go Surfing Now^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Lieutenant Icehammer^Guard Captain Zorek^The Path to Payback^^^Use the large Vrykul Harpoon Gun in Nifflevar to launch yourself into Valgarde. Report your victory over the Vrykul to Guard Captain Zorek.^Navigating the steep bluffs of Howling Fjord can be nerve-racking! I've come up with a solution to ease that burden by utilizing vrykul technology and dwarven ingenuity. With just a few adjustments and some fine tuning I've created Icehammer's harpoon controller! Of course it hasn't been tested, but that's what you're here for! Take the controller to the big gun in Nifflevar and use it to launch yourself into Valgarde. Report your victory to Zorek. Oh yea, you can keep the controller.Daggercap Divin'^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Harold Lagras^Harold Lagras^^^^Harold Lagras at the bottom of Daggercap Bay wants you to recover 10 Valgarde Supply Crates.^Hey... Uh... What's up? What are you doing down here? Me? Oh... Well, you see... I'm... Um... I'm trying to clean this place up! Orders from Keller himself! He says to me, "Harry, I want you to put on a divin' bell and search the shipwrecks of Daggercap for OUR stuff..." Say, maybe you could lend me a hand while you're down here. Throughout the bay here are all kinds of goodies, err, I mean supplies. Go out and bring me back whatever you find. Use this diving helm so you don't run out of air and die.The Explorers' League Outpost^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Beltrand McSorf^Stanwad^The Human League^^^Deliver McSorf's Bundle to Stanwad at the Explorers' League Outpost in Howling Fjord.^It's all a bunch of cryptic nonsense! Even with this cipher I can't make heads or tails of these tablets. Admittedly, cryptography is not my strong point. You'll need to take the cipher and tablets to our cryptographer, Stanwad. Unfortunately, I haven't heard from Stanwad in two weeks. He took a team of twenty scientists to the dig sites on the southeastern bluffs of the fjord and hasn't been heard from since. The best I can do is have McGoyver over there give you a lift with his flying machine.Alicia's Poem^70^All^Shattrath City^Alicia^Caylee Dak^^^^You have been asked to deliver Alicia's Poem to Caylee Dak in Shattrath City in Outland.^Hi, I wrote a poem for my friend Caylee. She likes to hang out with the Aldor in Shattrath City. You know, in Outland? Could you take my poem to her? My mommy says I'm too young to go to Shattrath City!The Slumbering King^72^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Mezhen's Writings^Captain Adams^^Dealing With Gjalerbron^^Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken King Ymiron. Should you manage to do so, return to Westguard Keep and report your success to Captain Adams.^A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below. However, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron. If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late.The Slumbering King^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Mezhen's Writings^Chieftain Ashtotem^^Dealing With Gjalerbron^^Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken King Ymiron. Should you manage to do so, return to Camp Winterhoof and report your success to Chieftain Ashtotem.^A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below. However, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron. If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late.The Fragrance of Money^71^All^Howling Fjord^Handsome Terry^Handsome Terry^Pirates of the North Seas^^^Handsome Terry at Scalawag Point in Howling Fjord wants you to obtain 4 Bear Musk from the Rabid Brown Bears in the surrounding area.^Us pirates are known for many things, but hygiene isn't one of them. Most pirate ships be carrying five or six times as many rats as people. It's no wonder all the bears on this island caught the rabies soon after we moved in. Long story short, the boss wants 'em all dead. It just so happens I know a recipe for a bear musk fragrance popular among Stormwind nobles. We kill the bears and sell the musk. I see a fine business opportunity for us here. What say ye?Feeding the Survivors^71^All^Howling Fjord^Elder Atuik^Elder Atuik^^^Arming Kamagua^Elder Atuik at Kamagua in Howling Fjord wants you to obtain 6 pieces of Island Shoveltusk Meat from Island Shoveltusk in the Isle of Spears.^We tuskarr rely mostly on our fish catch for sustenance. In times of great need, however, we will on occasion hunt land animals. The nearby village of Iskaal was recently attacked by pirates and the survivors just keep pouring in. Our catch has been modest this week, but there are many shoveltusk on the island and their meat is plentiful. Aid my people by hunting these great beasts and obtaining their meat.Arming Kamagua^71^All^Howling Fjord^Elder Atuik^Elder Atuik^Arming Kamagua^Feeding the Survivors^^Elder Atuik wants you to obain 3 Chimaera Horns.^Issliruk, the spirit of war, is depicted as a silver eagle by my people. Our stories tell of how Issliruk fought against a hundred worgs to save his young. It is time for us, too, to fight against our foes to save our brethren. We will need to craft new weapons. The horns of the frostwing chimaera that make their home in the snowy parts of the island are sharp and are easily crafted into spear tips. Bring me the best of these horns that you can find.Avenge Iskaal^71^All^Howling Fjord^Elder Atuik^Elder Atuik^Arming Kamagua^^Travel to Moa'ki Harbor^Elder Atuik wants you to go to Iskaal and slay 8 Northsea Slavers. Use the Horn of Kamagua should you need assistance.^The totem of Issliruk is ready, <name>, and for that I thank you. We must cast our peaceful ways for the time being and strike at those who've attacked our land and our kin. The pirate slavers that raided Iskaal have lost their minds and slaughtered all their captives. Go to Iskaal, to the east of here and do what must must be done. Take this horn and call on my brethren should you need assistance.Zeh'gehn Sez^71^All^Howling Fjord^Zeh'gehn^Handsome Terry^Pirates of the North Seas^^^Return to Handsome Terry to decipher what Zeh'gehn asked of you.^Is like dis, mon. Ye be wantin' me 'elp spotting some craven bag-o-wire been cardin' da crew? Ye gotta bring me a croaker, matey. Aft I an' I show ye who da blaggard be, mon. Nah, nah, croaker show ye. Ye'll ku fer yerself with yer own deadlights, yahso. Bring us a carver yahso too, 'atsteppa. Galang, bucko.Trust is Earned^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Trust is Earned^Return to Valgarde^^Hidalgo at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to find a Fjord Grub and feed it to one of the falcons in the cage by his feet.^The first and most important factor in falconry is the bond between the falconer and <his/her> bird. Trust must be earned by the master! <Hidalgo points to the falcons in the cage at his feet.> If you are to earn their trust you will first need to fill their bellies. The fjord rock falcon, as these birds are known, primarily eat grubs. Throughout the fjord you will find loose rocks that serve as breeding grounds for these grubs. Find a grub and return here to feed the falcons in the cage.Gambling Debt^71^All^Howling Fjord^Taruk^Taruk^Gambling Debt^Forgotten Treasure^^Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to collect "Silvermoon" Harry's Debt.^I heard you did a little work for Terry. I was hoping someone reliable would show up around these parts. See, pirates love to gamble. They, however, do not love to pay their gambling debt. If you're interested in collecting some coin on my behalf, I'd be willing to give you a cut. Let's start you out with an easy one. "Silvermoon" Harry's a bit of an eccentric, keeps all sorts of expensive blood elf knickknacks inside his tent - yet when I see him he always pretends to be broke. Get my gold.The Ransacked Caravan^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Trust is Earned^^^Hidalgo at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Trained Rock Falcon to recover 5 Fjord Turkeys.^I was leading a caravan here from Valgarde that was attacked by Dragonflayers. I was the only survivor of that ambush. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it back here with the cargo of fjord turkeys. This is the perfect opportunity for you to get your feet wet with your rock falcon. <Hidalgo hands you a cage.> Take this falcon cage and head west down the road leading out of this camp. Use the falcon to capture the loose turkeys and return here when you've gathered enough. Remember to feed the falcon!Jack Likes His Drink^71^All^Howling Fjord^Taruk^Taruk^Gambling Debt^^^Taruk at Scalawag Point in Howling Fjord wants you to collect Jack Adams' Debt.^Our next customer, Jack Adams, won't be the pushover that Harry was. He spends all day drinking with his friends, tough pirates all of them. Let's not use force this time, could get ugly. See if you can use his drinking habit to your advantage. There's only so much alcohol someone can handle before passing out. Maybe one of the bar wenches will be of assistance. Once he's out, see if you can slip your hand into his pocket and get what's mine.Dead Man's Debt^71^All^Howling Fjord^Taruk^Taruk^Gambling Debt^^^Taruk at Scalawag Point wants you to search for Black Conrad's Treasure on the plateau in the northeastern end of the Isle of Spears, just north of Iskaal.^You might've heard of Black Conrad, he's a famous pirate around these parts. Well, he had a thing for gambling on my fights. He had a thing for not paying, too. I'd love to collect, but trouble is... he's dead. I was about ready to write the whole thing off, when I came across this... <Taruk unfolds a map of the Isle of Spears with an X on a northeastern plateau.> He hid his treasure on tuskarr land. I want you to get it. I'll be damned if I let that bilge sucker get away without paying.Falcon Versus Hawk^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Trust is Earned^^^Hidalgo at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use your Trained Rock Falcon to capture 10 Fjord Hawks.^Do you feel the closeness, <name>? Surely you feel a true bond forming between you and your falcon. Would you believe me if I told you that when the time is right you'll be able to see through the eyes of your bird? Aye, it is the ultimate level of falconry. But first you must hunt more! The bird must hone and quicken its reflexes. Send it against a more formidable opponent! The fjord hawks of the region make the tops of the trees around us their homes. They shall be your next target!Swabbin' Soap^71^All^Howling Fjord^Scuttle Frostprow^Scuttle Frostprow^^Street "Cred"^The Way to His Heart...^Scuttle Frostprow wants you to obtain Big Roy's Blubber as the main ingredient for her magic swabbin' soap. Return to her on the eastern pirate ship at Scalawag Point when you have it.^Yeah, I got to get the deck swabbed spotless afore Mad Jonah comes 'round. An' I ain't gonna do it on my hands and knees neither! Problem is, we're all outa soap. That's more your problem than mine though, mate. Being the newbie 'round here, I gots a special trip for ya to make. Up on the northwest coast of this island, there's a whole mess o' sea lions. Amongst the nearby ice floes you'll find the alpha bull, Big Roy. Bring me back his blubber and I'll magic-up the best soap ya ever seen!There Exists No Honor Among Birds^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Hidalgo the Master Falconer^Trust is Earned^^^Hidalgo at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use your Trained Rock Falcon to capture 8 Fjord Hawk Eggs.^You are most definitely ready for the next step in falconry, <name>. Take your trained falcon east of here, to the vrykul hawk roost near the Stonewall Lift. From the roost you will send out your falcon to steal the eggs of the hawks. Their nests will be located in remote areas of the cliff walls surrounding the roost. Locate those nests and use your falcon to scavenge for the eggs! Beware the fjord hawk matriarchs, <name>. Should you come under attack, use your falcon's escape and soar abilities to flee!The Jig is Up^71^All^Howling Fjord^Annie Bonn^Annie Bonn^"Crowleg" Dan^^^Annie Bonn at Scalawag Point wants you to bring her Jonah Sterling's Spyglass.^I know why you're here, <name>. You've been sent to kill our leader, Jonah Sterling. I'd like to offer my help. Jonah's leadership threatens our operation. Attacking the Horde and the Alliance fleets simultaneously? Suicidal. Trying to sell the tuskarr as slaves when they die days after leaving this climate? Disastrous. Jonah's hideout is located inside a cave west of here. Bring me his spyglass as proof of the deed and my first action as lead will be to end all attacks against your allies.The Way to His Heart...^69^All^Howling Fjord^Anuniaq^Anuniaq^^Swabbin' Soap^^Toss Tasty Reef Fish at a Reef Bull to lead it to a Reef Cow. Once you have helped the two to find true love, return to Anuniaq at Kamagua.^The Northsea Pirates slaughtered the isles' alpha sea lion bull, Big Roy. They made soap from him to clean the decks of their ships! <Anuniaq sighs.> Now the sea lions won't mate. Help me to repopulate their numbers. The reef bulls can be found at the Twin Shores to the southeast. They crave the tasty reef fish that can be found on the east and west sides of the isles. Take this net and gather enough fish, at least a dozen -- maybe more, to lure a bull across the strait to a reef cow.A Traitor Among Us^71^All^Howling Fjord^Handsome Terry^Zeh'gehn^Pirates of the North Seas^^^Speak to Zeh'gehn at Scalawag Post.^Our second in command, Annie Bonn, has been acting rather paranoid as of late. She seems sure we have an infiltrator in our ranks, can ye believe it? Anyhow, we have a foolproof way of uncovering rats around these parts. See, good ole' Zeh'gehn over here happens to be an authentic witch doctor. His family hails all the way from Zul... something or other. Go let him know that we're in need of his divination skills. I must warn ye, <name>, only one or two of us can understand anything Zeh'gehn says.Problems on the High Bluff^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Stanwad^Walt^The Human League^^^Speak with Walt.^As usual, the real work is left up to me and my crew. Thankfully McSorf's team didn't die for nothin'. The cipher they recovered will help us crack the stuff we've found up here - that is if we can ever get back to it! Damned iron dwarves have sprung up like leaks all over the place and are now attemptin' to bury the sites! Can you believe it? Bastards want to bury our finds! Anyhow, talk to Walt over yonder. He'll get you started.Tools to Get the Job Done^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^The Human League^^We Can Rebuild It, We Have the Technology^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to recover his Building Tools.^I've been studying this deactivated construct for days, <name>. I think I can create a reasonable facsimile of the golem that would have room inside to fit one passenger. The idea being that it would fool those iron dwarves and allow us to get inside Baelgun's. Now I'm not gonna be able to make anything with a hammer and poker. I need my tools! Unfortunately I left those behind at Ivald's Ruin when the iron dwarves first attacked. Get me my tools! Ivald's Ruin is located far to the northeast.A Carver and a Croaker^71^All^Howling Fjord^Handsome Terry^Zeh'gehn^Pirates of the North Seas^^"Crowleg" Dan^Get a Shiny Knife from "Silvermoon" Harry and capture a Scalawag Frog. Bring these to Zeh'Gehn at Scalawag Point.^Some of the pirates around here... we have our own special way of talking. Zeh'gehn has... many different special ways of talking... all mixed together. From what I can tell he wants a frog and a knife. "Silvermoon" Harry might have a knife on the cheap. There's frogs all over town, just grab one and bring it to him along with the knife. I'd hate to be in the poor critter's shoes, if you know what I mean.Out of My Element?^70^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Donny^Donny^^Return to Valgarde^^Donny at Ivald's Ruin in the Howling Fjord wants you to kill 10 Iron Rune Destroyers, 5 Iron Rune Laborers and 2 Iron Rune Sages.^Keep it down, <race>. These iron dwarves are quick on the trigger. Now don't let the activities down in the dig fool you. Those steel-skinned abominations aren't digging anything up! No sir - on the contrary - they're burying the site! For whatever whacked out reason, they don't want anyone finding this place. What kind of dwarf buries ancient relics and dig sites? I'll tell you what kind: the kind you kill with reckless abandon! Get in there and take 'em out!Outpost Over Yonder...^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Donny^Stanwad^^Return to Valgarde^^Deliver Donny's Letter to Stanwad at the Explorers' League Outpost.^I see that you haven't visited my brothers at the Explorers' League Outpost south of here. Why don't you do Donny a favor and deliver this message to Stanwad. He'll be interested to hear about the activities of the iron dwarves up here. Like I said, mount up and start heading south. You'll see the outpost right before you get to Baelgun's."Crowleg" Dan^71^All^Howling Fjord^Zeh'gehn^Handsome Terry^"Crowleg" Dan^A Carver and a Croaker^^Confront "Crowleg" Dan, who is in one of the ships at Scalawag Point. Speak to Handsome Terry when you've completed this task.^Croaker's spoken, matey. "Crowleg" Dan's on da ship yonder. Best go trace that blaggard, mon. Show'im dis set's not fe be crossed. Gaan back fe Terry when ye keelhaul 'is behind.Meet Number Two^71^All^Howling Fjord^Handsome Terry^Annie Bonn^"Crowleg" Dan^^^Speak to Annie Bonn at Scalawag Point.^All the good work you've done for us hasn't gone unnoticed, <name>. Our second in command, the delightful Annie Bonn, is incredibly impressed with what you've done so far and wants to meet you.Crisis at the Sunwell^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Adyen the Lightwarden^Exarch Larethor^Crisis at the Sunwell^^^Adyen the Lightwarden on the Aldor Rise in Shattrath City has requested that you travel to Sunwell Plateau and speak with Larethor.^By the naaru, I thank you, <race>, for your efforts. Our work is far from finished, however, and I must request that you undertake a critical mission - one as important as any I've issued. Our forces are spread thinly. To compound the strain, we've had to dispatch a contingent to Azeroth to investigate developments at the Sunwell Plateau. You are needed there, <name>. Report to Larethor. Tell him that I wish we could spare more men.Duty Calls^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Dathris Sunstriker^Exarch Larethor^Duty Calls^^^Dathris Sunstriker on Scryer's Tier in Shattrath City has insisted that you travel to Azeroth at once and report to Larethor at the Sunwell.^Hear me, <race>. Duty requires that you return to Azeroth. Every able person is to report to the Sunwell Plateau immediately. I'm afraid I have no more information to share, except this: You'll be joining forces with the Aldor for this mission. Speak with a draenei by the name of Larethor when you arrive. Apparently, the situation calls for us to set our differences aside and join forces. Prepare yourself, friend. This sounds serious.We Can Rebuild It^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^^Tools to Get the Job Done^Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jum^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Large Barrel, Industrial Strength Rope and Dark Iron Ingots.^Tools? Check. Materials? Negative. If we're going to build this thing, you're going to have to get me the materials. First things first, <name>. For the skeletal structure I'm going to need a large barrel from Nifflevar, some dark iron ingots from Valgarde, and industrial strength rope from Baleheim. Nifflevar and Baleheim are vrykul towns northwest of here. Valgarde is located in Daggercap Bay, also to the northwest. Speak with McGoyver to get the ingots. He'll fly you back here once you're all done.We Have the Technology^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^^Tools to Get the Job Done^Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jum^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to bring him a Pristine Shoveltusk Hide and Steel Ribbing.^While the infrastructure for a piece of machinery like this is important, we can't underestimate the appearance of the construct. If we're to fool the iron dwarves the clone must be exact! I can make this happen. Bring me a pristine shoveltusk hide from the shoveltusk of this region and steel ribbing from vrykul in Nifflevar or Baleheim to the northwest.Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jumping^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jumping^We Can Rebuild It, We Have the Technology^^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Rocket Jump ability at Walt's Iron Rune Carving.^Alright, <name>; the time has come for you to climb inside this thing and learn how to use its basic abilities. When you're ready, get on the work bench and I'll get you situated inside the construct. Your first lesson is going to be using the construct's transportation system. You'll notice that the iron dwarves have set up special rune carvings around the dig site. Their constructs use those rune carvings to power up and fly from point to point. Try it with the rune carving I built here.Magisters' Terrace^70^All^Shattered Sun Offensive^Exarch Larethor^Tyrith^Crisis at the Sunwell^^^Exarch Larethor at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to search Magisters' Terrace and find Tyrith, a blood elf spy.^Welcome to the Sunwell, <class>. Get yourself settled in and contribute however you can - there's much to do! Me? Yes, I have a little something that needs doing, but I'm not sure you're up to the task. We've had a contact embedded in Magisters' Terrace gathering intelligence for us. He's recently failed to report and I'm growing concerned. The terrace is just up the rise to the east. The information he was collecting is vital to our mission. Think you can handle it, <race>?Iron Rune Constructs and You: Collecting Data^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jum^^^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Collect Data ability while standing near the Iron Dwarf Relic.^The most important part of your job while controlling the construct is the collection of data. I've placed an iron dwarf relic in the cart over yonder. It's the floating, lightning infused crystal. Get on the work bench and I'll put you back in the construct. Once you're back in the driver's seat, use the construct's data collection ability to pick up the test data.The Scryer's Scryer^70^All^Shattered Sun Offensive^Tyrith^Kalecgos^Crisis at the Sunwell^^^Tyrith wants you to use the orb on the balcony in Magisters' Terrace.^<Tyrith winces in pain as he speaks.> Go to the terrace... use the orb. ...They're...feeding the sunwell....  <Tyrith gasps for breath.> Hurry... They must be stopped... before they can.... <Tyrith dies.>Iron Rune Constructs and You: The Bluff^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jum^^Lightning Infused Relics, The Delicate Sound of Thunder^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Bluff ability on Lebronski after you've walked on his rug.^You always gotta have a contingency plan in case your main plan backfires! That's why I've built in some anti-intelligence systems into the construct. Your shiny new ride might rouse some suspicion while you're at Baelgun's excavation site. That's what your bluff ability is for! Just use that any time you're confronted and you'll be safe from harm. Test it out on Lebronski by walking on his rug. Once he starts huffin' and puffin', use the bluff! Get on the work bench when you're ready to begin.Hard to Kill^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Kalecgos^Exarch Larethor^Crisis at the Sunwell^^Wanted: The Signet Ring of Prince Kael't^Kalecgos has asked you to defeat Kael'thas in Magisters' Terrace. You are to take Kael's head and report back to Larethor at the Shattered Sun Staging Area.^Welcome to the Sunwell, mortals. Your arrival is indeed timely. As you've now witnessed, the Legion forces work tirelessly, manipulating the Sunwell's power to achieve their malevolent ends. Kael'thas has risen from the ashes of defeat and once more leads them in their efforts. Find him, mortals. He must again be stopped. Other, equally urgent matters require my immediate attention. I shall leave Kael's fate to you. Do not fail. With luck, we shall speak again.Lightning Infused Relics^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^^Iron Rune Constructs and You: The Bluff^News From the East^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct's Collect Data ability to collect 15 sets of Iron Rune Data.^Your construct is ready to go. All abilities have been given a once over and I've programmed the machine to both comprehend and speak the language of the titans. Take the construct to Baelgun's Excavation Site, due south of here, and collect data from the lightning infused relics that litter the site. Remember to bluff any iron dwarves that suspect your construct to be a fake. And don't forget about rocket jumping from rune to rune to get around in there! Get on the table when you're ready!The Delicate Sound of Thunder^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Walt^^Iron Rune Constructs and You: The Bluff^News From the East^Walt at the Explorers' League Outpost in the Howling Fjord wants you to use the Iron Rune Construct to explore the thundering cave at Baelgun's Excavation Site.^The cavern that we opened at Baelgun's was the one place that most steered clear of... Can't say I blame 'em. The sound of thunder shot out of that cave, <name>! Loud, booming thunder! I think near the end, it was abandoned by all. Bad, bad things happened to any that went in to explore - most never coming back. I want you to check that cave out while you're at Baelgun's. Explore around the titan statue inside and report back with your findings.Learning to Fly^70^Alliance^Shadowmoon Valley^Nutral^Ilsa Blusterbrew^^^^Speak with Ilsa Blusterbrew at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley.^Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying <his /her> own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place. I understand the feeling completely. You, my friend, need to head to Wildhammer Stronghold in the southwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Ilsa Blusterbrew about some flight instruction. Mind you, her training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while.Learning to Fly^70^Horde^Shadowmoon Valley^Nutral^Olrokk^^^^Speak with Olrokk at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley.^Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying <his /her> own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place. I understand the feeling completely. You, my friend, need to head to Shadowmoon Village in the northwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Olrokk about some flight instruction. Mind you, his training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while.Wanted: The Signet Ring of Prince Kael'thas^70^All^Shattrath City^Wind Trader Zhareem^Wind Trader Zhareem^^Hard to Kill^^Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain The Signet Ring of Prince Kael'thas. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.^<class>, today I ask the impossible. Today, you must obtain the signet ring of Kael'thas Sunstrider, lord of the blood elves! It's true, the rumors of his death within Tempest Keep were ill-founded. He has appeared once more, this time at the Magisters' Terrace on the Isle of Quel'Danas. What he is doing there is a tale for someone else to tell you. What I know is that I have innumerable collectors interested in his princely ring, and I mean to acquire it for them. Or rather, I mean for you to do so.Wanted: Sisters of Torment^70^All^Shattrath City^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun^^^^Nether-Stalker Mah'duun wants you to slay 4 Sisters of Torment. Return to him in Shattrath's Lower City once you have done so in order to collect the bounty.^It has been whispered to Mah'duun that the sisters of torment are to be sent back to the hells from which they sprang. Mah'duun knows that these demons can be found at the Magisters' Terrace on the Isle of Quel'Danas. You will do this thing to earn the bounty, or you will not.News From the East^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Walt^Captain Adams^^Lightning Infused Relics, The Delicate Sound of Thunder^The Clutches of Evil^Speak with Captain Adams at Westguard Keep.^Westguard needs to know what's going on here, <name>. I want you to personally deliver the news to Captain Adams. Whenever you're ready, let me know and I'll put you back in the construct for one final flight. It'll take you to Westguard Keep, but more than likely blow up in the process. It's been a pleasure...In Defense of Halaa^70^Alliance^Nagrand^Lakoor^Lakoor^^^^Defeat 10 enemy players in Halaa and return to Lakoor in Telaar.^We are not a warlike race, <race>. However when war comes to our lands, we do not run away from it. The Alliance and the Horde wage war in the city of Halaa, to the northwest. We do not know what the blood elves are scheming, but any victory for the Horde would be disastrous. The history between our people and the orcs is one of bloodshed and betrayal. Go and slay the enemy in Halaa and you will be rewarded in coin, honor and renown.Enemies, Old and New^70^Horde^Nagrand^Karrtog^Karrtog^^^^Defeat 10 enemy players in Halaa and return to Karrtog in Garadar.^Our ancient enemy, the draenei, have returned with powerful allies. They wage war in Halaa, southwest of here. We cannot allow them a victory there as Garadar would be next without a doubt. Go and slay those who would aid our ancient enemy.The Dead Rise!^71^All^Howling Fjord^Orfus of Kamagua^Orfus of Kamagua^Orfus of Kamagua^^^Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in the Howling Fjord wants you to find Fengir's Clue, Rodin's Clue, Isuldof's Clue and Windan's Clue.^The path east of us is a primary hunting trail of the tuskarr. At least that's what it used to be... More recently our hunters have been returning to Kamagua claiming that the dead have risen and are out for blood! That is what has brought my son and me here. Elder Atuik asks that we find resolution in the bluffs. Will you assist us in our time of need? I seek heroes willing to brave the perils of Shield Hill, southeast of here. Search the desecrated graves for clues and return your findings to me.Spirits of Auchindoun^62^Alliance^Terokkar Forest^Exorcist Sullivan^Exorcist Sullivan^^^^Help the Alliance secure a tower in the Bone Wastes.^Auchindoun's spirits have no stake in the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, but incurring their favor will give our side an edge in the region. Ancient custom directs the living to pay their respects at spirit towers in the Bone Wastes - though only at specific times of the day. If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will have helped bring the spirits to our side. Should we succeed in gaining the spirits' favor, they will grant us a boon that will aid us in our endeavors.Spirits of Auchindoun^62^Horde^Terokkar Forest^Exorcist Vaisha^Exorcist Vaisha^^^^Help the Horde secure a Spirit Tower in the Bone Wastes.^The draenei might be our enemies, but the spirits of their ancestors in Auchindoun are restless and have no allegiance. The draenei's custom required them to pay their respects at spirit towers at various times during the day. If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will help the spirits return to peace in Auchindoun. The Alliance will try to capture the towers in order to secure the dead's favor. We must ensure that our side succeeds instead.Elder Atuik and Kamagua^71^All^Howling Fjord^Orfus of Kamagua^Elder Atuik^Orfus of Kamagua^^^Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord wants you to deliver Orfus's Bundle to Elder Atuik at Kamagua.^<Orfus bundles up the clues you brought him.> My people are bitterly entrenched in a war with the Northsea Freebooters. If any tuskarr could help us in our quest to right the wrongs of the pirates, it will be Elder Atuik of Kamagua. You must take these clues to him at once. To get to Kamagua you must take the Ancient Lift, behind me. Take the lift directly to Kamagua and find Elder Atuik.Grezzix Spindlesnap^71^All^Howling Fjord^Elder Atuik^Grezzix Spindlesnap^Orfus of Kamagua^^^Speak with Grezzix Spindlesnap.^The pirate thieves have set up port at Scalawag Point, far to the south. Unfortunately, they have fortified their camp with many deadly defenses. There is someone that might be able to assist us in infiltrating Scalawag. A pirate mercenary by the name of Grezzix Spindlesnap recently came to our village in search of food and shelter. In exchange he gives us information about our enemies and feeds them misinformation about our attack plans. Seek him out at his ship just off the coast here - southwest.Street "Cred"^71^All^Howling Fjord^Grezzix Spindlesnap^"Silvermoon" Harry^Orfus of Kamagua^^Forgotten Treasure, Swabbin' Soap^Speak with "Silvermoon" Harry at Scalawag Point about the missing Vrykul artifacts.^The Northsea Freebooters all fear and respect Grezzix. I'm thinking they recognize my special talents and envy my amazing ship. All you need to do is tag along with my cabin boy, Lou, and you'll be in like... In like tin. Pirates love tin. Just talk to Lou when you're ready to go and he'll take you to Scalawag. Oh yea, you'll want to talk to "Silvermoon" Harry first. He'll have more information on the stuff they pilfered. Just watch what you say around him. He's a freak... crazy for blood elves."Scoodles"^71^All^Howling Fjord^"Silvermoon" Harry^"Silvermoon" Harry^Orfus of Kamagua^^The Staff of Storm's Fury, The Frozen Heart of Isuldof, The Lost Shield of the Aesirites, The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir^"Silvermoon" Harry at Scalawag Point wants you to recover his Sin'dorei Scrying Crystal from the orca, "Scoodles."^One of the first things Jonah Sterling did after he went crazy was to take my prized sin'dorei scrying crystal and feed it to the bane of my existence, "Scoodles" the orca. No I didn't name the damned thing. I just know that she swims out past the ships directly southeast of Scalawag. Kill that overinflated goldfish and rip out my beautiful sin'dorei crystal from its stomach. Do this and we can get down to business.The Staff of Storm's Fury^71^All^Howling Fjord^"Silvermoon" Harry^Orfus of Kamagua^^"Scoodles"^A Return to Resting^Recover the Staff of Storm's Fury and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord.^Those artifacts are cursed and you'd be crazy to go looking for them, <race>. I know for certain that anyone that's come into direct contact with any of those items has either gone mad or been killed. Take that staff, for example. Last I heard the ship that held it was abandoned and left to rot on the coast of the Isle of Spears, north of here. If you want that thing, check the ship's hold. Whatever you do, don't bring that staff back here! And steer clear of Abdul! He'll tear your heart out.The Frozen Heart of Isuldof^71^All^Howling Fjord^"Silvermoon" Harry^Orfus of Kamagua^^"Scoodles"^A Return to Resting^Recover the Frozen Heart of Isuldof and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord.^Some say Jonah was never quite right in the head, but I know the truth. It was the heart. That damned frozen heart! I saw the change in him the second he pulled it from the grave. I could see the blood freeze in his veins... It was then that the madness truly took over. He left us to hole up in his cave on the north side of this island. Last I heard he had thrown the heart in the back of his bear den. Too little, too late... I'll kill you myself if you even think about bringing that heart back here!Maintaining the Sunwell Portal^70^All^Blade's Edge Mountains^Exarch Nasuun^Exarch Nasuun^^Report to Nasuun^^Obtain 10 Smuggled Mana Cells and return them to Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.^We must maintain the energy to our portal or it will collapse. The mana cells that the ethereals at Bash'ir Landing have hidden will continue to serve our purposes. The landing sits atop the northwestern corner of the Blade's Edge Mountains, far to the north. Remember, acquire a phase device from one of the ethereals and then use it to locate the smuggled goods. Just be cautious of the phase wyrms that they use to guard the mana cells.Blood for Blood^70^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Magistrix Seyla^Magistrix Seyla^^The Missing Magistrix^^Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to kill 4 Emaciated Felbloods by using the Fel Siphon on them. You will need Demonic Blood from nearby Wrath Heralds to power the Fel Siphon.^When Kael's forces retreated through that portal, his most loyal lackeys were rewarded with an abominable gift. They stayed behind and gorged themselves on the blood of demons for days. The blood has changed them, given them new powers. It will also prove their undoing. Obtain blood samples from other demons. Use them to power this fel siphon and deprive these arrogant fools of their new powers. Slay them in their weakened state and return to me.Blast the Gateway^70^All^Hellfire Peninsula^Magistrix Seyla^Magistrix Seyla^^The Missing Magistrix^^Magistrix Seyla at the Throne of Kil'jaeden wants you to use the Sizzling Embers to summon a Living Flare and slay Incandescent Fel Sparks near it until it becomes an Unstable Living Flare. Return to the Legion Gateway with the Unstable Living Flare to destroy it.^We have to shut down this gateway to stop Legion reinforcements to the Isle of Quel'Danas. Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare. It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy. Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare. The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable. Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway. It will know what to do.The Lost Shield of the Aesirites^71^All^Howling Fjord^"Silvermoon" Harry^Captain Ellis^The Lost Shield of the Aesirites^"Scoodles"^^Speak with Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy.^If you listen real close you can hear cannon fire coming from the northeast. That's Captain Ellis's ship, Sister Mercy. Thing is, Ellis and his entire crew were killed 'bout a month ago. <Harry nods.> Ghost ship... If it's info you be wantin' 'bout the shield, Ellis is the man to ask. Sister Mercy docks on the small island between here and Sorlof's Strand to pick up more souls for the ship's crew 'bout once every five minutes. There be no shortage of souls 'round these parts...Rediscovering Your Roots^70^All^Terokkar Forest^Mar'nah^Mar'nah^^^^Mar'nah at Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to travel to Razorthorn Rise in Outlands, collect 5 Razorthorn Roots, and return to her.^My stocks are presently sufficient, but I'll need plenty of razorthorn roots to keep up with the demand. Collecting the roots is difficult, but I know a special method of extraction. Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root. To find the roots, travel to Outlands and fly northeast from Shattrath until you reach Razorthorn Rise. Return to me, <name>, once you have collected five of the roots.Arm the Wards!^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Captain Theris Dawnhearth^Captain Theris Dawnhearth^^^^Captain Theris Dawnhearth at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to obtain 4 Mana Remnants from Wretched Fiends and Wretched Devourers and use them to energize one of the Crystal Wards surrounding the structures in Sun's Reach.^We've succeeded in reactivating the crystal wards around the sanctum, but why stop there? We'll build defenses around the other structures, but the Wretched are stubborn and continue to steal power from the crystal wards. Hunt them down and get the mana remnants they carry. Use the remnants to energize the sanctum wards; the safety of our operation depends on it.Further Conversions^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Vindicator Xayann^Vindicator Xayann^^^^Vindicator Xayann at the Shattered Sun Staging Area wants you to place the Attuned Crystal Cores inside 5 defeated Erratic Sentries to turn them into friendly units.^My plan to replace the damaged crystals on the erratic sentries has been a success. We've managed to take the Sun's Reach Sanctum with their help. I've crafted new crystals that will bring more of them under our control; place them inside the hulls of defeated sentries. We'll deploy them to other locations once they're converted.The Missing Magistrix^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Captain Theris Dawnhearth^Magistrix Seyla^^^Blood for Blood, Blast the Gateway^Use the Captured Legion Scroll near the portal at Dawning Square. Once you've gone through the portal, find Magistrix Seyla.^We sent one of our operatives to investigate the fel portal in the middle of Dawning Square, south of here. She never returned. Take this scroll we found on one of the enemy corpses. We believe it will grant you access through the portal. Once through, find Magistrix Seyla and aid her in any way you can.Mutiny on the Mercy^71^All^Howling Fjord^Captain Ellis^Captain Ellis^The Lost Shield of the Aesirites^^^Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy in the Howling Fjord has asked that you recover 5 Barrels of Blasting Powder from the ship's hold.^Aye, we got problems, matey. Me gunners have mutinied! M'n'the crew up top be tryin' to kick Sorlof's keester while dealin' with the mutinous gunners down'blo. Ye're gonna have to go down'blo and deal with those mutinous sea dogs and take their blastin' powder for the big'un o'er on the poop deck. With ye mannin' the big'un, Sorlof is sure to die and give up the booty!Sorlof's Booty^71^All^Howling Fjord^Captain Ellis^Captain Ellis^The Lost Shield of the Aesirites^^^Slay Sorlof using the Big Gun and recover Sorlof's Booty. Return Sorlof's Booty to Captain Ellis aboard the Sister Mercy.^Me crew is gonna get the big'un all primed an'ready for ya, matey. She's restin' snuggly on the bow, o'er on the other side of the ship. Go'n man it and be ready to fire when Sorlof is in our sights! Once we take that landlubber down, ye'll have to recover the booty for us, seein' as how we can't leave the damned ship! Bring that booty back to me and ye'll get your cut - the shield...The Shield of the Aesirites^71^All^Howling Fjord^Captain Ellis^Orfus of Kamagua^The Lost Shield of the Aesirites^^A Return to Resting^Return the Shield of the Aesirites to Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in the Howling Fjord.^Here's yer shield. Me hopes it doesn't curse ye like it did me'n'me crew. Ye don't have to go home, but ye can't stay here... I be certain that thar be some that would be interested in getting' it back. Now get that thing off me ship!Strange Engine Part^70^All^Fishing^Strange Engine Part^K. Lee Smallfry^^^^Take the Strange Engine Part to K. Lee Smallfry in Telredor.^This strange engine part doesn't look like it fits in a steam pump, much less anything else you've seen. Perhaps K. Lee Smallfry might know something about it.The Air Strikes Must Continue^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Battlemage Arynna^Battlemage Arynna^^^^Battlemage Arynna wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker when you're ready to fly over the Dead Scar. Once there, use the Arcane Charges to kill 2 Pit Overlords, 3 Eredar Sorcerers and 12 Wrath Enforcers.^We've taken the armory from the enemy thanks to our aerial attacks against the Legion's forces in the Dead Scar. As a matter of fact, it's gone so well that we're going to continue our air strikes against them. Take these arcane charges and use them against their forces. Talk to Ayren Cloudbreaker at the Sun's Reach Harbor when you're ready for flight.Report to Nasuun^70^All^Shattrath City^Tradesman Portanuus^Exarch Nasuun^^^Maintaining the Sunwell Portal^Tradesman Portanuus has asked you to speak with Exarch Nasuun on the Terrace of Light in Shattrath City.^I am most glad that you are here, <class>! When we took this sanctum from the wretched, we hurried to create a magical portal that leads here from Shattrath City in the Outland. My liege lord, Exarch Nasuun, is heading up the Offensive's efforts to maintain that portal. He asked me to send along any promising candidates who have what it takes to help with acquiring more energy to fuel it. Please, travel to Shattrath City and speak with him inside A'dal's chamber on the Terrace of Light.Don't Stop Now....^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Smith Hauthaa^Smith Hauthaa^^^^Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests.^Now that we have an anvil, I can really get to work. No matter how many supplies we receive, I'll always be able to put the Darkspine Iron Ore to good use. We'll need a constant supply of weapons and armor if we're to be successful here. There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here. They're collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one....The Battle Must Go On^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Harbinger Inuuro^Harbinger Inuuro^^^^Harbinger Inuuro wants you to slay 6 Burning Legion Demons and the Emissary of Hate in Dawning Square. Use the Shattered Sun Banner to impale the Emissary of Hate's corpse.^We must continue to defeat and demoralize the armies of the Legion. The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers deployed to reinforce tactical Legion positions. The enemy rallies around them for they fear them more than they fear us. Today we will change that. Take this banner and slay the demons of the Legion. When you meet the emissary, slay and impale him.Crush the Dawnblade^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Magister Ilastar^Magister Ilastar^^^^Magister Ilastar at Sun's Reach Armory wants you to slay 6 Dawnblade Summoners, 6 Dawnblade Blood Knights and 3 Dawnblade Marksmen.^We've driven the Dawnblade army out of the Sun's Reach Harbor. Sun's Reach is ours in its entirety. Yet somehow... I'm not entirely satisfied. I want you to go to Dawnstar Village, west of here, and slay any surviving Dawnblade combatants. They sealed their fate when they followed Kael to this place.Disrupt the Greengill Coast^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Captain Valindria^Captain Valindria^^^^Captain Valindria wants you to free 10 Greengill Slaves. Return to her onboard the Silvermoon's Pride at Sun's Reach Harbor once you have done so.^The naga have taken the Greengill Coast to the southeast. Their females, the Darkspine sirens, are using magic to enslave the indigenous murlocs. It's my responsibility to see to it that whatever the naga are up to over there is disrupted. That's where you come in. <class>, I want you to get the controlling orbs from the female naga and throw them near the Greengill slaves, breaking the orb and setting the murlocs free. My guess is that the murlocs will be incensed and turn on their masters.Keeping the Enemy at Bay^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Vindicator Kaalan^Vindicator Kaalan^^^^Vindicator Kaalan at the Sun's Reach Armory wants you to speak to Ayren Cloudbreaker and fly over the Dawnblade reinforcement fleet. Use the Flaming Oil to set the ship sails on fire as you fly and once you land, slay 6 Dawnblade Reservists.^We've managed to capture Sun's Reach in its entirety. Unfortunately a fleet of Dawnblade reservists is on its way to take back the harbor. Take this oil and secure a dragonhawk from Ayren Cloudbreaker. You should be able to fly within reach of the ships' sails; once you're close enough, set them on fire. Land in one of the ships and attack the reservists. With their ship sails on fire they won't be able to mount much of a defense.Ata'mal Armaments^70^All^Shadowmoon Valley^Smith Hauthaa^Smith Hauthaa^^^^Smith Hauthaa needs you to produce 5 Cleansed Ata'mal Metal. Do so by breaking down Ata'mal Armaments on her anvil at the Sun's Reach Armory on the Isle of Quel'Danas.^The Ata'mal Terrace in eastern Shadowmoon Valley is holy to the draenei, but is now overrun by fel orcs. They have dug up the special ore from that place and created corrupted weapons and armor. I need the armaments to form an alloy with the naga ore. Our anchorites have blessed my anvil with the ability to cleanse them. Retrieve the armaments from the Shadowmoon chosen, slayers and darkweavers. Return them here, breaking down and purifying them upon my anvil, and then hand me the cleansed results.Open for Business^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Mar'nah^Mar'nah^^^^Mar'nah at the Sun's Reach Harbor wants you to gather 5 Bloodberries from the bushes found on Quel'Danas.^Welcome, <name>. There are a number of ways I can assist you in your efforts here. For example, I've recently discovered a recipe for a unique elixir. The bloodberry grows wild in many regions of Azeroth and has long been considered nothing more than a nuisance. I've learned though, that when exposed to the Sunwell's power this plant takes on special properties that can be distilled and imbibed to magnify one's abilites. Bring me a sample from the nearby bushes and I'll show you what I mean.Know Your Ley Lines^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Astromancer Darnarian^Astromancer Darnarian^^^^Astromancer Darnarian in the Sun's Reach Sanctum wants you to use the Astromancer's Crystal at the Bloodcrystal, the Dawning Square portal, and the naga shrine at Greengill Coast.^Freeloaders! You all want instant gratification - never giving thought to the effort required to create even the simplest of portals. Perhaps a little education will instill a bit of gratitude for my ceaseless efforts. Take this crystal. Attune it to the Bloodcrystal to the west, at the Dawning Square portal just south of here, and at the naga shrine at Greengill Coast to the southeast. Perhaps then you'll appreciate your precious translocations....Your Continued Support^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Anchorite Ayuri^Anchorite Ayuri^^^^Anchorite Ayuri at Sun's Reach in Sunwell Isle wants you to donate 10 gold.^We've built a memorial to honor those slain in battle. It's but a small consolation to the families that lost their loved ones. I am taking up a collection to aid the orphans and spouses of our war heroes. If you can spare a small donation it would go a long way.A Magnanimous Benefactor^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^Anchorite Kairthos^Anchorite Kairthos^^^^Anchorite Kairthos wants you to donate 1000 gold to aid in Anchorite Ayuri's efforts. You will be known as <name> of the Shattered Sun if you complete this quest.^You've done so much for us, <name>. We greatly appreciate your assistance. You might have noticed Anchorite Ayuri's efforts outside. She has a big heart and is very convincing, but the donations do not quite add up to what she had expected. If you were to make a large contribution to her cause, I will make sure that word of your deeds in this war spreads far and wide. What do you say?Enter, the Deceiver...^70^All^Isle of Quel'Danas^General Tiras'alan^Archmage Ne'thul^^^^Report to Archmage Ne'thul on the Isle of Quel'Danas, north of Quel'Thalas.^Despite our best efforts, Kael'thas's sinister plans have been carried out. The Sunwell has been re-ignited in preparation for the Deceiver's arrival. The object that stands before me and below A'dal is a representation of the current status of the Sunwell's defenses. Mighty barriers have been raised, stymieing our attacks against the inner chambers. If ever there were a time that our world needed assistance, it would be now. Report to Archmage Ne'thul at the Isle of Quel'Danas, north of Quel'Thalas.Winterfin Commerce^71^All^Borean Tundra^King Mrgl-Mrgl^Ahlurglgr^^Learning to Communicate^Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!, Them!^Collect 5 Winterfin Clams and deliver them to Ahlurglgr at Winterfin Retreat.^Now that you can speak with the Winterfin, it is time for you to let them get to know you. One of the best ways to do that is to conduct business with them. The murlocs prize clams over any other object and their only surviving merchant is Ahlurglgr. If I were you, I'd collect a handful of Winterfin clams and give them to him as a gift. The clams can be found all over down in the trench, as well as across it in the Winterfin village and their caverns.Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!^71^All^Borean Tundra^King Mrgl-Mrgl^King Mrgl-Mrgl^Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!^Winterfin Commerce^^King Mrgl-Mrgl has asked you to rescue 20 Winterfin Tadpoles. Return to him at Winterfin Retreat once you have done so.^Oh good, you're back! When the landslide at the village across the water exposed the caverns, a malevolent lobstrok, known as Claximus, came out of the caves and stole the Winterfin tadpoles away. Something happened to all of the murlocs that followed him in there, and when they re-emerged, they were under his control. <class>, you must swim across the waters and rescue the Winterfin tadpoles in the village and caverns. The future of the Winterfin tribe depends upon you!Them!^71^All^Borean Tundra^Brglmurgl^Brglmurgl^^Winterfin Commerce^^Brglmurgl at Winterfin Retreat has asked you to kill 15 Winterfin murlocs. Any combination of warriors, oracles, and shorestrikers will do.^Our brothers and sisters across the water are now our mortal enemies. They have kidnapped our tadpoles, driven us out of our village, and killed more of us than I can count. Prove yourself, <race>! Swim across the rift and slay them! Despite the favor that the new king has shown you, only then will we consider accepting you here. Fail to do so, and you might as well leave now and never return!I'm Being Blackmailed By My Cleaner^71^All^Borean Tundra^King Mrgl-Mrgl^Mrmrglmr^Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!^^^King Mrgl-Mrgl has asked you to speak with Mrmrglmr at the northwest end of Winterfin Retreat.^I have something embarrassing to admit: I'm being blackmailed! Mrmrglmr agreed to clean some of my things, and got hold of my spare murloc costume. He's threatening to reveal my true nature to the other murlocs. I need not explain to you what a disaster that would be! Besides, I have a plan that's going to require that we get that costume back. Please, <name>, go to Mrmrglmr at the other end of the Retreat to the north and do whatever he asks of you.Grmmurggll Mrllggrl Glrggl!!!^71^All^Borean Tundra^Mrmrglmr^Mrmrglmr^Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!^^^Mrmrglmr wants you to return to him at Winterfin Retreat with Glrggl's Head.^If your pathetic little eyes were any good, you'd see that we're being slaughtered by the orcas to the north in the bay! Assuming your precious night elf king wants his spare costume back, I think you'll do me a favor and bring back the head of the king of the orcas, Glrggl: he who swims against the tides of fate -- eradicating the hope of life for all those who hear the siren song of death upon the waves! Be quick about it, <race>, Winterfin murlocs are losing their lives even as we waste time talking!Succulent Orca Stew^71^All^Borean Tundra^Cleaver Bmurglbrm^Cleaver Bmurglbrm^^^^Cleaver Bmurglbrm has tasked you with acquiring 7 Succulent Orca Blubber. Return with them to him at Winterfin Retreat.^Word is, strange <race>, that you might be going after the king of the orcas, Glrggl. That's all fine and good, but if you want to taste the stew that makes life worth living, then you'll bring me back the succulent blubber of the orcas that swim in Glimmer Bay. Hurry... I have quite a bit of cutting to do on this carcass if you want to reap the benefits of your efforts.The Spare Suit^71^All^Borean Tundra^Mrmrglmr^King Mrgl-Mrgl^Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!^^^Return King Mrgl-Mrgl's Spare Suit to him at Winterfin Retreat.^Very well, your king's secret is safe with me as long as he continues to help us against our enemies. Here, take this to him. I cleaned it up nicely, though I have no idea why he needs a second disguise. Maybe he has something in mind for you?Surrender... Not!^72^All^Borean Tundra^King Mrgl-Mrgl^King Mrgl-Mrgl^Oh Noes, the Tadpoles!^^^King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat has asked you to bring him a Claw of Claximus.^The time has come to put an end to this unnatural situation, <name>. For the Winterfin murlocs to have a chance at a future, Claximus must die! I want you to take my spare murloc suit and enter the Winterfin Caverns under the pretext of surrender. With the white flag in hand, the murlocs won't attack you. You'll find him in the southwestern most corner of the caverns. Once you get close enough, deal with Claximus. Bring me one of his claws as proof that the grisly deed has been done.The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir^71^All^Howling Fjord^"Silvermoon" Harry^Orfus of Kamagua^^"Scoodles"^A Return to Resting^Recover the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir and deliver it to Orfus of Kamagua in the Howling Fjord.^I was on the vessel that was bringing in the armor. We'd just boarded the ship and were headin' back here when we were attacked by a Forsaken destroyer. They boarded our ship, took all the booty for themselves, and then sunk her. That was the last I'd seen of that armor. If you want, you can take my bomber from Scalawag to the dreaded isle that the destroyer be docked. Talk to my woman, Alanya, outside. She'll get you on the bomber. If you manage to find the stuff, don't you dare bring it back!A Return to Resting^71^All^Howling Fjord^Orfus of Kamagua^Orfus of Kamagua^A Return to Resting^The Staff of Storm's Fury, The Frozen Heart of Isuldof, The Shield of the Aesirites, The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir^^Use the Bundle of Vrykul Artifacts at the ransacked burial mounds of Shield Hill to return the Frozen Heart of Isuldof, the Shield of the Aesirites, the Staff of Storm's Fury and the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir.^<Orfus hands you a satchel.> Within this satchel are the artifacts that you recovered. Locate the burial mounds of Shield Hill, far to the southeast, where the items were originally stolen from and return the artifacts. It is my hope that this gesture will quell the spirits that now haunt our hunting grounds. Be strong, <name>...Keymaster Urmgrgl^71^All^Borean Tundra^Glrglrglr^Glrglrglr^^^^Glrglrglr inside the Winterfin Caverns has asked you to retrieve Urmgrgl's Key.^I have to get out of these caverns! There's magic stuff seeping in from Coldarra, above, and affecting everyone's minds. I don't intend to be controlled like these others! Keymaster Urmgrgl is in the cave below and to the south. He holds the key to my cage. Get it from him and bring it back so that I can unlock my cage and get out of here. Hurry!Escape from the Winterfin Caverns^71^All^Borean Tundra^Lurgglbr^King Mrgl-Mrgl^^Learning to Communicate^^Escort Lurgglbr to safety and then report to King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat with the good news.^The lock on my cage doesn't look too solid, but I'm not foolish enough to try to leave without assistance. Will you help me safely get out of these caverns? There's no time to waste, <race>. When you get back to the retreat, please let the king know that I'm okay. He's sure to give you a reward.Learning to Communicate^71^All^Borean Tundra^King Mrgl-Mrgl^King Mrgl-Mrgl^King Mrgl-Mrgl^^Winterfin Commerce, Escape from the Winterfin Caverns^King Mrgl-Mrgl has given you a conch to use upon Scalder's remains. Return The King's Filled Conch to him at Winterfin Retreat.^To help, you must learn how to speak the Winterfin dialect. We'll work with the forces of nature and magic to do that. Take this empty conch shell. At the bottom of the watery trench below exists Scalder, an elemental of air and watery fury. Once she is defeated, use the conch upon her remains to capture her magical steam. Return the full conch to me, and I'll imbue my knowledge of the Winterfin tongue into you. Luckily, a friend taught me a water breathing spell, which I will cast upon you.Return to Atuik^71^All^Howling Fjord^Orfus of Kamagua^Elder Atuik^A Return to Resting^^^Deliver the bad news to Elder Atuik at Kamagua.^Return to Elder Atuik at Kamagua. He and the rest of my people must be warned of this impending doom that approaches from the sea. <Orfus shivers.> Use the Ancient Lift to reach him. Please hurry!Orfus of Kamagua^71^Alliance^Howling Fjord^Lunk-tusk^Orfus of Kamagua^Orfus of Kamagua^^^Find Orfus of Kamagua at the Ancient Lift in Howling Fjord.^Hail, traveler. I am Lunk-tusk of the Kalu'ak. We are known as tuskarr to your people. My partner and I were recently sent up to investigate strange happenings along one of our hunting trails. It was when we approached the graveyard known as Shield Hill that we were attacked by the undead. I was lucky to make it to this camp, but I am uncertain as to what became of Orfus. We parted ways at the Ancient Lift, southeast of here along the cliff edge. Will you go see if he is ok?Too Close For Comfort^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Endorah^Librarian Donathan^Too Close For Comfort^Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^Prison Break^Endorah wants you to go to Amber Ledge north of Warsong Hold and thank those there for rescuing her.^I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me? I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts - I was surrounded! A magical box appeared above me, opened up and pulled me inside. Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of red drakes. It was breathtaking! I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, find them, and pass on my gratitude.Nick of Time^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Midge^Librarian Donathan^Nick of Time^Plug the Sinkholes^Prison Break^Midge in Valiance Keep wants you to go to Amber Ledge to the north and thank those there for rescuing her.^I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me? I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts. I was surrounded! A huge magical cube appeared above me. It opened up and pulled me inside. I swear it's true! Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of drakes - It was amazing! My captors scattered and I was able to escape. I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, if you see them, pass on my gratitude.Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Garren^Librarian Garren^Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly^^^Garren on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Cleftcliff Anomaly.^Greetings, <race>. I am Garren of Dalaran. Not long ago, the rift was a peaceful place - geothermally speaking at least. Recently though, earthquakes have occurred with alarming frequency and scars in the earth have appeared, exposing unique energy fields of chaotic power. My mission here is to chart and monitor these anomalies. My instruments indicate that another has appeared on the cliff face to the southwest. Take this device with you and use it when you locate the new disruption.Monitoring the Rift: Sundered Chasm^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Garren^Librarian Garren^Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly^^^Garren at Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Sundered Chasm anomaly and return to him with the readings.^Did you feel that?! That was just an aftershock... you should've been here a few minutes ago! I'm afraid I must call upon your services again. My instruments indicate that there is an immense disruption just west of here, far beneath the water's surface. Just as before, I need you to take the arcanometer and capture the anomaly's data. I'll cast a spell that will enable you to breathe underwater. If it wears off before you find it, come let me know and I'll renew its effects.Hellscream's Vigil^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Warsong Recruitment Officer^Garrosh Hellscream^^^^Speak with Garrosh Hellscream in Warsong Hold.^Throm-Ka, <race>! Welcome to Warsong Hold. My heart swells with pride to see that such a distinguished hero of the Horde has answered the call of duty! This impregnable fortress is a testament to the tenacity of the Horde. Through much we have battled to establish this foothold in Northrend. It is from here that our journey to Icecrown begins and it is through the leadership of the son of Hellscream that we will succeed! Garrosh awaits your arrival below. Lok'tar ogar!Hellscream's Vigil^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Warsong Recruitment Officer^Garrosh Hellscream^^^^Speak with Garrosh Hellscream in Warsong Hold.^Throm-Ka, <race>! Welcome to Warsong Hold. My heart swells with pride to see that such a distinguished hero of the Horde has answered the call of duty! This impregnable fortress is a testament to the tenacity of the Horde. Through much we have battled to establish this foothold in Northrend. It is from here that our journey to Icecrown begins and it is through the leadership of the son of Hellscream that we will succeed! Garrosh awaits your arrival below. Lok'tar ogar!Prison Break^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Donathan^Librarian Donathan^Too Close For Comfort^^^Librarian Donathan on Amber Ledge wants you to collect the Beryl Prison Key from one of the Beryl Mage Hunters at Beryl Point and use it to release a trapped mage from an arcane prison.^Greetings, <class>. I am Donathan, a loyal representative of Dalaran. Forgive my abruptness, but we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis. Mages all across Azeroth are being abducted and I have been authorized to conscript anyone able to assist in the unraveling of this mystery. The camp just south of ours is where our investigation begins. I call upon you to rescue one of the imprisoned mages held there. You must obtain a key from one of the mage hunters and use it to open an arcane prison.Abduction^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Donathan^Librarian Donathan^Too Close For Comfort^^^Donathan wants you to use the Arcane Binder on a wounded Beryl Sorcerer at Beryl Point and return to Amber Ledge with him.^<name>, we have a situation. I've just learned that one of our archmages en route from Dalaran has gone missing. Naturally, we suspect the mage hunters are behind her disappearance. Time is clearly of the essence. We must know what has become of Lady Evanor at once if we are to have any hope of rescuing her. Take this device. Return to Beryl Point and use it on a Beryl sorcerer when he is near death. It should bind him long enough for you to bring him here for questioning.Report to Steeljaw's Caravan^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Overlord Bor'gorok^Grunt Ragefist^^^^Speak with Grunt Ragefist at Steeljaw's Caravan.^That dimwitted cur, Steeljaw, tried to take our caravan of supplies on a shortcut through a taunka graveyard! We just struck up relations with them! Now the caravan lies in ruins, overrun by the taunka spirits that rose out of their graves as he was trampling them. Head south and see if you can salvage the situation, <class>. I sent Grunt Ragefist and a few others down there with him to help out. Why don't you see if you can lend a hand.We Strike!^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Longrunner Proudhoof^Overlord Bor'gorok^^^^Help Longrunner Proudhoof and his Warsong raiders to survive the assault upon Steeljaw's Caravan and finish off the spirit of Force-Commander Steeljaw.^One of your orcs named Steeljaw tried to save some time by taking a shortcut through our burial grounds. This had better not be how your Horde normally acts, <race>, or you will find the taunka to be the end of you! But, you look as if you want to help fix this situation. Good! Steeljaw's cursed spirit now haunts this place and disturbs the remains of my ancestors. We must put an end to him! If we live through this, tell your Overlord Bor'gorok at the outpost to the north. Are you with me?We Strike!^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Longrunner Proudhoof^Overlord Bor'gorok^^^^Help Longrunner Proudhoof and his Warsong raiders to survive the assault upon Steeljaw's Caravan and finish off the spirit of Force-Commander Steeljaw.^One of your orcs named Steeljaw tried to save some time by taking a shortcut through our burial grounds. This had better not be how your Horde normally acts, <race>, or you will find the taunka to be the end of you! But, you look as if you want to help fix this situation. Good! Steeljaw's cursed spirit now haunts this place and disturbs the remains of my ancestors. We must put an end to him! If we live through this, tell your Overlord Bor'gorok at the outpost to the north. Are you with me?Put Them to Rest^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Grunt Ragefist^Grunt Ragefist^^^^Put 20 taunka spirits, either Ghostly Sages or Risen Longrunners, to rest and then report back to Grunt Ragefist at Steeljaw's Caravan.^Force-Commander Steeljaw's idiocy caused this mess. What was he thinking taking a caravan through a taunka burial mound? Still, what's done is done. Now it is up to us to deal with the consequences. Overlord Bor'gorok asked me to help Longrunner Proudhoof in any way that I can. The longrunner has asked that we lay to rest the spirits of his ancestors. What do you say, <class>? Are you <man /strong> enough to handle such a simple task?The Defense of Warsong Hold^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^High Overlord Saurfang^Overlord Razgor^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^Report to Overlord Razgor at the hut on the south side of Warsong Hold.^Hellscream has the weight of the Horde upon his shoulders. Do not be dissuaded from your duties because of his temperament, <name>. <Saurfang nods.> Did you think that I would forget the name of a hero of Orgrimmar? It is not every day that I have the pleasure of putting the head of Nefarian on a pike! The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of Warsong Hold.The Defense of Warsong Hold^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^High Overlord Saurfang^Overlord Razgor^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^Report to Overlord Razgor at the hut on the south side of Warsong Hold.^Do not let Hellscream dissuade you from your duties as a soldier of the Horde, <race>. He bears a terrible burden in these frozen wastes, with the outcome of his charge resulting in victory over the Scourge or the extinction of all life on Azeroth. It is for this reason that we require your strength and wisdom. The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of Warsong Hold.The Defense of Warsong Hold^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^High Overlord Saurfang^Overlord Razgor^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^Report to Overlord Razgor at the hut on the south side of Warsong Hold.^It seems that we always meet in the direst of circumstances, Scarab Lord. Were you not saving the world from certain destruction the last time we met? <Saurfang chuckles.> Your assistance is most welcome in Northrend, despite what the young chieftain might say. If we had even a dozen more soldiers with your power, we would be sitting in Orgrimmar right now, hunched over a warm fire. Report to Overlord Razgor, right outside the main entry to Warsong Hold, to the south.Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Overlord Razgor^Overlord Razgor^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^Too Close For Comfort, Untold Truths, Ride to Taunka'le Village^Overlord Razgor at Warsong Hold wants you to kill 15 Nerub'ar Nerubians.^While Warsong is protected by 10 feet of steel and stone on all sides, this quarry is soft and primed for attacks by the Nerubians. <Razgor points west.> Beyond this quarry stand thousands of Scourge, awaiting orders to attack. Should the Nerubians take down our inner defenses, we will be overrun by the undead legions of Arthas. We can't let that happen - which is why you're going on the offensive and slaughtering the Nerubians in the quarry. Blood and thunder, soldier! Take 'em both with you.Thassarian, My Brother^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Leryssa^William Allerton^Word on the Street^^^Look for William Allerton inside the Farshire mine.^I recently received word from William Allerton, a family friend, that my brother enlisted here in Valiance Keep on the same day he did. Thing is... my brother's been dead for years. I sold everything I owned to come looking for Thassarian, only to be stonewalled by the local bureaucracy. I've even been threatened with arrest if I keep snooping around. I need someone in the good graces of the higher-ups... someone like you. If you can help me, I heard that William's stationed at the Farshire mine.The Late William Allerton^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^William Allerton^Leryssa^Word on the Street^^^Bring the Enlistment Card to Leryssa at Valiance Keep in Borean Tundra.^William's neck has been cut by a sharp object. Further inspection reveals a single clue to bring to Leryssa - an enlistment card bearing the name of William Allerton.Lost and Found^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Leryssa^James Deacon^Word on the Street^^^Speak to James Deacon at the inn in Valiance Keep.^Poor Mr. Allerton might yet help us find my brother. <Leryssa unveils a voluminous book, not unlike an army recruitment ledger.> I borrowed it, ok? Let's see, does that enlistment card have a date? William saw Thassarian at the enlistment line. Their entries must be near each other... here it is! He was assigned to... Unit S? All the other military units are named after Alliance towns. Who's in the unit? Where are they deployed? We need rumors. See if the innkeeper's heard anything.Cutting Off the Source^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Overlord Razgor^Overlord Razgor^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^^Overlord Razgor at Warsong Hold wants you to destroy 10 Nerub'ar Egg Sacs.^Aerial reconnaissance of the quarry reports that the Nerubians are storing their eggs on the scaffolding surrounding the base. Smart beasts these are... They're keeping the eggs high and dry, away from the epicenter of conflict. You're going to have to go back out there and track down their eggs. Find 'em, smash 'em, and trash 'em. Each egg destroyed means twenty less Nerubians feeding on our corpses.In Wine, Truth^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^James Deacon^Old Man Colburn^Word on the Street^^^Salvage a bottle of Kul Tiras Wine from the underwater shipwreck northeast of Valiance Keep and bring it to Old Man Colburn in the Valiance Keep inn.^The military was all that old man Colburn had. After he retired, he still clung to it like a lifeline. He knows the name of every general, unit, brigade, detachment... you name it. He's the man you need. Problem is, his mind is scarred. He won't talk to anyone unless he gets his Kul Tiras wine. Takes him back to the times he was a marine. I haven't received a shipment in months. The last merchant ship out of Kul Tiras sunk northeast of here. See if you can salvage a bottle to bring Colburn.A Deserter^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Old Man Colburn^Private Brau^Word on the Street^^^Find the prison inside Inner Hold in Valiance Keep and speak to the deserter.^Unit S... Unit S.... hmmmpph.... don't make any sense... it oughta be named after a town... Darkshire was sent to Dragonblight. The Goldshire boys were sent to the Fjord. Where did I hear... Oh, yes... the deserter! There's a turn-tail in the barracks prison. Got thrown in not too long ago. Kept saying that "S" stood for suicide. Look for the deserter. He might have some information for you.The Honored Ancestors^72^All^Borean Tundra^Elder Atkanok^Elder Atkanok^The Honored Ancestors^^^Elder Atkanok outside Coldrock Quarry wants you to identify the statues of Elder Kesuk, Elder Sagani, and Elder Takret.^<A distant voice echoes in your head as you regard the stone statue.> Do not be startled, stranger. I am Elder Atkanok, an ancient ancestor of the tuskarr people, a skilled craftsman in my own time and the guardian of this quarry for centuries. The quarry has been overrun, leaving many statues unfinished while the ancestors' spirits wander the world. Will you aid me in righting this wrong? First, I must know the names of these wandering ancestors. Look for the markers near their statues.Patience is a Virtue that We Don't Need^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Quartermaster Holgoth^Quartermaster Holgoth^Patience is a Virtue that We Don't Need^^^Quartermaster Holgoth at Warsong Hold wants you to recover 15 crates of Warsong Munitions.^We can kill all the Nerubians that we see and destroy all the eggs that we find, but those things won't stop coming until we blow their tunnels and passageways up. Of course, we can't do that without some heavy grade munitions. Unfortunately, most of our stockpile is being used up by the goblins and blacksmiths for our siege tanks and weaponry. We do happen to have a pretty good supply of the stuff out in Mightstone Quarry - underneath all the Nerubian crap. You'll just have to go out and get it for me.The Lost Spirits^72^All^Borean Tundra^Elder Atkanok^Elder Atkanok^The Honored Ancestors^^^Elder Atkanok, on the outskirts of Coldrock Quarry, wants you to free the spirits of 3 Kaskala Craftsmen and 3 Kaskala Shaman.^In the attack on the quarry, the shaman and craftsmen working here were slain. The violence threw the spirit world into utter chaos and we'll be unable to guide the ancestors home unless we find a way to soothe the spirits of the murdered. The aggressors themselves pay no heed to the spirits, but their companions, the beryl hounds, sense the spirits and hold them in thrall. Kill the beryl hounds, and using the raw energy left behind, break the imprisonment of the spirits of the innocent.Bury Those Cockroaches!^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Quartermaster Holgoth^Quartermaster Holgoth^Patience is a Virtue that We Don't Need^^^Quartermaster Holgoth at Warsong Hold wants you to use the Seaforium Depth Charge Bundle to destroy the Nerub'ar sinkholes to the south, east, west and north of Warsong Hold.^North, south, east and west. Those are the locations that you should be concerned about. Surrounding this fortress, within Mightstone Quarry, are four perfectly situated Nerub'ar sinkholes. <Holgoth hands you a bundle.> Be very careful with that package, <name>. Mishandle it and you'll be dog meat. Inside the bundle are seaforium depth charges. Get to each of those Nerub'ar sinkholes and plant a depth charge at their center point. If all goes well, the tunnels will collapse. Get a move on!Picking Up the Pieces^72^All^Borean Tundra^Elder Atkanok^Elder Atkanok^The Honored Ancestors^^^Bring 6 Tuskarr Ritual Objects to Elder Atkanok, who stands outside Coldrock Quarry.^With the spirits of the murdered craftsmen and shaman at rest, the way is clear for us to complete the ceremonies interrupted by the attack. You must perform a role traditionally reserved for a tuskarr shaman, and you must possess all the necessary ritual items. There is no time to craft new ones, so you will need to scour the quarry for those left by the victims of the attack. Handle these objects with care, <name>, for some are centuries old. You may need to wrest them from the hands of the invaders.Leading the Ancestors Home^72^All^Borean Tundra^Elder Atkanok^Elder Atkanok^The Honored Ancestors^^^Elder Atkanok wants you to guide the spirits of Elder Kesuk, Elder Sagani, and Elder Takret to their stone monuments.^With your help, the ancestor spirits can now be guided to their rightful homes, the statues lovingly prepared by Kaskala's craftsmen and shaman. The ceremonies for these ancestors were interrupted during the attack on the quarry, and you will need to complete them. Take with you the objects that you recovered from the quarry, stand in front of the statues with the name markers, and recite this chant. <Words in a strange language flood your head, but you have no difficulty recalling them.>Taken by the Scourge^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Foreman Mortuus^Foreman Mortuus^^^^Foreman Mortuus at Warsong Hold wants you to free 5 Warsong Peons.^<Mortuus sighs.> Peons... We may as well post up a sign offering the Nerub'ar a free meal. See, the problem with a peon is that: (1) they're dumber than dirt; and (2) they're weaker than a leper gnome. Of course they're the first to be taken by the Scourge! This puts me in a bit of a predicament, you see. Without peons, manual labor comes to a halt. No peons, no construction. Find and release my peons, <race>. If they're alive, you'll find 'em spun up in webbing throughout Mightstone Quarry.Reclaiming the Quarry^72^All^Borean Tundra^Etaruk^Etaruk^Reclaiming the Quarry^^^Etaruk, camped near the entrance to the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill 12 Beryl Treasure Hunters.^You're a welcome sight, <class>. My name is Etaruk, and I used to be a craftsman here at the Coldrock Quarry. My companions and I were preparing a new set of statues for their last set of rites when we saw those mysterious blue platforms come flying over the plateau. When they landed, the mages they carried swarmed the quarry, murdering my fellows and plundering the quarry. If we don't stop them, they'll destroy our statues and make off with our artifacts. Will you help me defeat the invaders?Karuk's Oath^71^All^Borean Tundra^Karuk^Karuk^A Diplomatic Mission^^^Karuk wants you to slay 6 Skadir Raiders and 5 Skadir Longboatsmen.^They call themselves the Kvaldir. My people have legends about them; we call them the tuk-hariq - walkers of the fog. My village was destroyed by these giant mist-men. Everyone I knew was slain, including my father Ariut. By tuskarr law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood. I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the test of manhood... I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir. If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you.Untold Truths^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Barthus^Shadowstalker Luther^Untold Truths^Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^^Find Shadowstalker Luther in Mightstone Quarry.^We are here by order of Varimathras! The mission of the Shadowstalkers is a simple one: spy. Well, spy with a little assassination on the side. One of my best field agents has gone missing. I haven't heard from him in days, which has left me fearing the worst. No, not death! Death would be ideal. I fear he may have gone rogue... turned traitor even. His last known location was northern Mightstone Quarry. He was gathering intelligence on the Nerubians. Find him. He better be dead...Nerub'ar Secrets^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Luther^Shadowstalker Barthus^Untold Truths^^^Take Luther's Journal to Shadowstalker Barthus at Warsong Hold.^You skim through the pages of the book, looking for anything of importance. On the last page you discover what appears to be frantic scribbling: Necrolords. At least a dozen by my count. Farms to west being used as some sort of horrible spawning glade for Scourge. Row upon row of victims. I think they're on to me. Made a dash for the hold. I won't be captured alive. Dreadvenom hemotoxin. If they decide to bite into me, they'll be in for a surprise. Take this information back to Barthus.Message to Hellscream^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Barthus^Garrosh Hellscream^Untold Truths^^^Take Barthus's Note to Garrosh Hellscream at Warsong Hold.^<Barthus tears out the last page and rolls it up.> Take this to Hellscream at once! In the meantime, I'm going to send a team to scout out the farms. Be sure to tell Hellscream that we're going to need reinforcements.Hampering Their Escape^72^All^Borean Tundra^Etaruk^Etaruk^Reclaiming the Quarry^^^Etaruk, outside the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to destroy the North Platform, the East Platform, and the West Platform.^I'm sure you've seen those blue and white platforms hovering over the quarry. They're the transportation the mage hunters used to land their forces here, and now they're loading them up with our artifacts and fragments of our statues. We must stop them before they leave the quarry. The small creatures digging in the quarry carry explosives. Take them and use them to destroy the three floating platforms. The leader keeps watch from a fourth, grounded platform, but we'll deal with him afterward.Reinforcements Incoming...^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Garrosh Hellscream^Shadowstalker Ickoris^Untold Truths^^Merciful Freedom, Damned Filthy Swine^Seek out Shadowstalker Ickoris at the Warsong Farms Outpost west of Warsong Hold.^<Hellscream shakes his head.> You may not have noticed that we're trying to win a war here, <race>. I need all available soldiers at the primary points of conflict. This means that we don't have any real soldiers to spare for these minor incursions. <Hellscream pauses to think.> If Barthus wants reinforcements at the farm... <Hellscream claps his hands together.> ...he shall have them! Report to Barthus's assassins at the farms, west of here. Let them know that reinforcements have arrived.Gamel the Cruel^71^All^Borean Tundra^Karuk^Karuk^A Diplomatic Mission^^A Father's Words^Karuk wants you to defeat Gamel the Cruel at Riplash Strand.^My own father was slain by the leader of this raiding party, Gamel the Cruel. He has made his abode inside a cave on the beach. You've dealt with his men already. Finish what you've started, <name>. Avenge my father and I will share with you what little I still have.A Father's Words^71^All^Borean Tundra^Karuk^Veehja^A Father's Words^Gamel the Cruel^^Look for Veehja at the Shrine of Scales on Riplash Strand.^There is someone who might shed light on this mystery, <race>. It is rumored that the Kvaldir have kept a naga priestess alive at the temple on the west side of the shore. She will no doubt have great reason to resent her uninvited Kvaldir guests. Perhaps my father is expecting her to cooperate with you in some way.A Visit to the Curator^72^All^Borean Tundra^Etaruk^Etaruk^Reclaiming the Quarry^^^Etaruk, on the outskirts of the Coldrock Quarry, wants you to kill Curator Insivius.^The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before. He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. <name>, I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all.The Sky Will Know^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^Imperean^To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^^^Speak with Imperean at the Ruins of Eldra'nath.^I must find out what happened to my master, Farseer Grimwalker! Earlier, he was observing the magnataur at nearby Magmoth. But one of his grunts just returned, saying that the group had been crushed, and that the farseer was dragged into the depths of the place. Before I send you on a suicide mission, I wish to consult with the spirits to learn more. There is an air elemental known as Imperean in the ruins of Eldra'nath to the west. She is wise and may give you the information we seek.The Trident of Naz'jan^71^All^Borean Tundra^Veehja^Veehja^A Father's Words^^^Veehja in Riplash wants you to go to the far northeastern end of the Riplash Ruins. Once there slay Ragnar Drakkarlund and obtain the Trident of Naz'jan from him.^Five hundred years ago, Azshara imprisoned a being named Leviroth in the waters below. Now these barbarians seek to undo our queen's work! They took over our city and began to sacrifice my brethren to awaken him! When they ran out of naga, they began to take tuskarr. Their spirits will know no peace! I will help you, for it will go a long way towards quelling my vengeance. Their captain, Ragnar, dwells deep inside northeastern Riplash. He has in his possession a golden trident. Bring it to me!The Emissary^71^All^Borean Tundra^Veehja^Karuk^A Father's Words^^^Find Leviroth in the waters below the iceberg floating among the northern edge of Riplash Ruins. Use the Trident of Naz'jan to slay him and return to Karuk to the north of Riplash Strand.^Raj Naz'jan was the emperor of Riplash when Leviroth was imprisoned. Azshara herself blessed his trident so it would slay the beast should it ever escape. Now you wield it, <race>. As much as it disgusts me, I will have my revenge on these barbaric giant-men. Take the trident to the depths beneath Riplash. You will find Leviroth below an iceberg closest to northern Riplash. Drive the trident into his flesh and slay him! Return to whomever sent you when you're done; I wish to see no more of you.Boiling Point^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Imperean^Imperean^To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^^^Imperean wants you to beat Simmer and Churn into submission. Return to her at the Ruins of Eldra'nath when they have submitted.^Ah, it is information that you crave: the whereabouts and condition of your 'farseer'. He did not see so far as to avoid the trouble which befell him. Nevertheless, I will give you the means to acquire the knowledge. But first, you will do some things for me. No doubt you have seen the war between fire and water to the south. Simmer keeps boiling Churn's pool, and the two have been battling for ages. Go to the Charred Rise and Blistering Pool, and convince each of them to stop their bickering.Shrouds of the Scourge^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Chieftain Wintergale^Chieftain Wintergale^Shrouds of the Scourge^Patching Up^^Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village wants you to bring him 5 Scourged Mammoth Pelts.^To the northeast looms the Temple City of En'kilah, the Scourge's seat in Borean Tundra. From behind its walls, the Scourge commander has sent his Nerubians to surround us. Remaining on the defensive would doom my people, but my advisors differ in their strategies. Durm would charge in blindly, while Sage Aeire favors stealth. The Temple City has blighted the nearby lands and the native creatures. Aeire believes the pelts of the scourged mammoths can serve as a cloak that may hide an infiltrator.Return to the Spirit Talker^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Imperean^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^^^Deliver Imperean's Primal to Spirit Talker Snarlfang at Bor'gorok Outpost.^You have done what was asked, and now I give you that which you desire. Deliver this primal to the spirit talker back at your Bor'gorok Outpost. If she is wise, she will know a ritual to gain you the information which you seek.The Bad Earth^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Chieftain Wintergale^Chieftain Wintergale^Shrouds of the Scourge^^^Bring 8 clods of Scourged Earth to Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.^By curing the hides with the blighted earth outside the Temple City, Sage Aeire believes she can create a cloak which will cause most of the Scourge minions to ignore your presence. You should blend right in, she says. She'd best be correct. It's our only chance to gather information and plan our counterattack. You should be able to find the earth she needs poking in the areas to the south and west of the fortress. Bring it to me when you've finished gathering it.Vision of Air^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit, Revenge Upon Magmoth^Use Imperean's Primal to perform a ritual at Snarlfang's Totem at Bor'gorok Outpost to gain information concerning Farseer Grimwalker.^Here, <name>, I've attuned the primal to you. Open your soul to it in the presence of my totem of air and concentrate upon the fate of Farseer Grimwalker. The spirit of the wind touches all; with any luck you will be granted a vision.What the Cold Wind Brings...^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Ith'rix's Hardened Carapace^High Overlord Saurfang^^^^Take Ith'rix's Hardened Carapace to High Overlord Saurfang at Warsong Hold.^You hold the carapace fragment of Ith'rix the Harvester and realize that this is only the beginning. Even now you sense that victory is fleeting. Surely the Lich King has a thousand more beasts like Ith'rix, waiting to be unleashed upon the Horde. Take your trophy and present it to High Overlord Saurfang, inside Warsong Hold. He should be notified of your victory over a powerful Scourge agent.Blending In^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Chieftain Wintergale^Chieftain Wintergale^Shrouds of the Scourge^^A Courageous Strike, Neutralizing the Cauldrons^Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village wants you to wear the Imbued Scourge Shroud in the Temple City of En'kilah and scout the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain, and the Spire of Decay.^Sage Aeire has finished the shroud. Take it with you and travel to the Temple City of En'kilah. Don the cloak within the city's bounds to hide yourself from most of the Scourge there. This will be our best opportunity to gather information about the enemy's fortifications and leaders. While wearing the cloak, scout the three large spires on the grounds of the city. While the shroud will shield you from most of the Scourge, the En'kilah abominations will be able to find you if you get too close.Wind Master To'bor^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Overlord Razgor^Wind Master To'bor^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^^Report to Wind Master To'bor at Warsong Hold.^You're a tough mother, <name>. I think your talents are better suited elsewhere - like the root of the whole damn problem! <Razgor points to the west.> A thousand Scourge, at least four full sized floating death machines and who knows what else. But you're gonna find out and then you're gonna handle it... That's right, you're gonna beat the hell out of the Scourge army that's currently beating down our door. Get to the top of Warsong Hold and report to Wind Master To'bor. He'll be expecting you.Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^Vision of Air^^Speak with Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit inside of Magmoth.^You must go to Magmoth to the east. You must descend into the depths of their caverns. You must speak with Farseer Grimwalker's spirit!Magic Carpet Ride^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Wind Master To'bor^Gorge the Corpsegrinder^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^^Talk to Yanni at Warsong Hold to arrange safe travel to the coast. Speak to Gorge the Corpsegrinder once you arrive at Garrosh's Landing.^Tanks, mon. I be talkin' bout siege machines! We got heavy tanks stationed at Garrosh's Landing on da west coast. We gonna get you to da tank and you gonna use da tank to lay down some Horde justice on da Scourge! Da only tricky part be getting' you der. No way we be sendin' you on our wind riders. Too risky. You see dat pixie o'er der? Dat blondie elf? Yanni be his name, mon. He can get you to da coast, safely. Once der, talk to Gorge da Corpsegrinder!Kaganishu^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^^^Retrieve Kaganishu's Fetish and use it upon Farseer Grimwalker's Remains.^After my small force of grunts were killed, I was dragged down here and ritually murdered. The snobold who did this is known as Kaganishu. Though you have vanquished his shaman helpers, my spirit is still tethered to this place. After he slew me, he created a fetish from my body, which anchors me here. Kaganishu is using it to learn all that I know of shamanism. You must retrieve the fetish from him and use it upon my spirit. Kaganishu is nearby in the caves. Only then will I truly be free.Return My Remains^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit^^^Deliver Farseer Grimwalker's Remains, which are resting below his spirit, to Spirit Talker Snarlfang at Bor'gorok Outpost.^<name>, now that my spirit has been freed would you do me the honor of returning my remains to Spirit Talker Snarlfang? They lay upon the ground beneath me. I sense that the spirit talker is still at Bor'gorok Outpost to the west where last I saw her.Revenge Upon Magmoth^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Ortrosh^Ortrosh^^Vision of Air^^Kill 10 Magmoth Shaman, 5 Magmoth Foragers, 3 Magmoth Crushers, and 3 Mates of Magmothregar. Then, return to Ortrosh at Bor'gorok Outpost.^The overlord refuses to allow the shaman to heal my wounds. He says that it will be a good lesson for me and give me time to reflect upon my failure. But you could get revenge for me and the others who fell at Magmoth! I know that the spirit talker wants you to go in there to save the farseer. It's just to the east. Go, <class>... go slay the magnataur and their snobold servants. Regain the outpost's honor!Words of Power^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Chieftain Wintergale^Chieftain Wintergale^Shrouds of the Scourge^^Breaking Through^Bring High Priest Naferset's Scroll, High Priest Talet-Kha's Scroll, and High Priest Andorath's Scroll to Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.^Within the spires you described dwell the main lieutenants of the Scourge leader, the high priests. Not only do they command the Scourge forces, but they hold the key to the necropolis above, and their master. An endless stream of Scourge minions will overrun us if we can't find and defeat their leader. I cannot leave my people defenseless, however much Durm might want to bring the fight to the enemy. It falls to you, <name>, to slay the high priests and take the scrolls they hold.A Courageous Strike^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Durm Icehide^Durm Icehide^^Blending In^^Slay 15 En'kilah Ghouls and 5 En'kilah Necromancers and report back to Durm Icehide at Taunka'le Village.^From the beginning, I've counseled that Chieftain Wintergale should assemble our mighty warriors and attack our enemy at their base. My advice has fallen on deaf ears and he has proven that he'd rather tip-toe around according to Sage Aeire's plans. I'll wait no longer. If Chieftain Wintergale is too cowardly to send our warriors into battle, perhaps you'd be willing to show him that a direct attack can succeed. Storm the Temple City of En'kilah and slay all in your path, <name>.Tank Ain't Gonna Fix Itself^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Gorge the Corpsegrinder^Mobu^The Defense of Warsong Hold^^Mobu's Pneumatic Tank Transjigamarig, Super Strong Metal Plates!^Speak with Mobu at Garrosh's Landing.^We need to get these tanks back up and runnin'! They ain't gonna fix themselves. Mobu's gonna be the one to handle that stuff. Talk to him and see what he needs. Maybe you can shut him up before he finally drives me into a berserker frenzy and I cleave his little gnome-sized frame in two! I hate gnomes...Mobu's Pneumatic Tank Transjigamarig^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Mobu^Mobu^^Tank Ain't Gonna Fix Itself^Tanks a lot...^Mobu at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover his Pneumatic Tank Transjigamarig.^These wrenches are useless, buddy. I need my pneumatic tank transjigamarig to get these things up and running! Unfortunately, I left it at my old digs, on the other side of this landing. It's the beat down hut next to the stables. You're gonna have to go and get it for me, because I sure as hellfire am not going to go anywhere near the mist. Oh yea, buddy, watch out for the mist. The mist is what tore up these shores.Super Strong Metal Plates!^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Mobu^Mobu^^Tank Ain't Gonna Fix Itself^Tanks a lot...^Mobu at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to collect 10 Super Strong Metal Plates.^I need metal to patch these tanks up! Super strong metal plates can be found scattered about all across Garrosh's Landing and at the bottom of the bay. Just be careful when you're out there searching for plates. The mist is... um... AGGRESSIVE! The mist is what took out the landing and the adjoining tuskarr town. Poor little tuskarr...Dirty, Stinkin' Snobolds!^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Dirty, Stinkin' Snobolds!^The Mechagnomes^^Retrieve 10 boxes of Crafty's Stuff and return them to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^Those dirty, stinkin' snobolds... they stole all of my supplies! What's a snobold you ask? It's like a kobold, 'cept they serve the magnataur; kinda take care of them. I know, weird! Anywho, wanna help me out? I know the little creeps stole off with all of my stuff. Stupid me thinkin' that it'd be nice and safe, packed up on the north side of the airstrip. Why don'tcha do me a favor and head north to their stupid Magmoth. There's a cash reward if you bring all my stuff back quick!The Borean Inquisition^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Donathan^Librarian Normantis^Too Close For Comfort^^^Donathan ordered you to offer your assistance to Librarian Normantis in the mage tower on Amber Ledge.^Listen closely, <name>, for there is not a moment to spare. Your prisoner is being prepared for interrogation here in our tower. In the event that he is less than forthcoming, your assistance may be required. Make your way up to where he is being detained and tell Librarian Normantis that I've sent you to assist him.Neutralizing the Cauldrons^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Aeire^Sage Aeire^^Blending In^^Sage Aeire at Taunka'le Village wants you to use her totem to neutralize the East Cauldron, the Central Cauldron, and the West Cauldron in the Temple City of En'kilah.^The presence of plague cauldrons within the Temple City of En'kilah worries me greatly, <name>. It's clear that Chieftain Wintergale trusts your judgment and your knowledge of our enemy. Would you help me deal with the cauldrons as you help the chieftain carry out his plans in the Temple City? I've prepared a totem which will attack and neutralize the contents of the cauldrons. All you must do is locate the cauldrons and use the totem near each. Each Scourge weapon we destroy brings us closer to victory.The Art of Persuasion^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Normantis^Librarian Normantis^Too Close For Comfort^^^Librarian Normantis on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Neural Needler on the Imprisoned Beryl Sorcerer until he reveals the location of Lady Evanor.^It is fortunate you're here, <race>. You see, the Kirin Tor code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these. You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information. Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once! I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful....Motes of the Enraged^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Imperean^Imperean^To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^^^Obtain 5 Tempest Motes and deliver them to Imperean at the Ruins of Eldra'nath.^Now that their little squabble is dealt with, there is still the matter of helping you and your spirit talker. As you can see, my vassals have been enraged by the ongoing war between fire and water. This will not change anytime soon, but it will serve to your advantage. In order to assist you, what we need are their motes. Head further into the ruins and retrieve them from the tempests.Just a Few More Things...^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Dirty, Stinkin' Snobolds!^^Hah... You're Not So Big Now!^Collect Crafty's Tools, an Overcharged Capacitor, and a Handful of Rocknar's Grit. Deliver them to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^As you may have noticed, we created the airstrip on the southern border of a magnataur den! <Crafty says something uncharitable about Fizzcrank under her breath.> The old man has put me in charge of finding a... ahem... creative solution to this situation: if we don't deal with them soon, they'll come down here and tear us limb from limb! That's where you come in. I want you to get me everything on this shopping list. Please.Tanks a lot...^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Mobu^Gorge the Corpsegrinder^Tanks a lot...^Mobu's Pneumatic Tank Transjigamarig, Super Strong Metal Plates!^^Speak to Gorge the Corpsegrinder at the Coast of Echoes.^Thanks for all your help, buddy. You can let Gorge know the tanks are ready for action. Hopefully you can clean up this place once and for all!The Plains of Nasam^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Gorge the Corpsegrinder^Garrosh Hellscream^Tanks a lot...^^^Use the Horde Siege Tank to destroy 100 Scourge Soldiers and rescue 3 Injured Warsong Soldiers on the Plains of Nasam. You must also discover the identity of the leader of the Scourge assault.^Once you're ready, jump into one of the tanks and drive it out to the Plains of Nasam, southeast of here. Use the tank's weapon arsenal to take down the Scourge army. If you get in a jam, the "Meatpounder" will tear 'em up and the land mines will finish 'em off! If you find any of our soldiers, grab 'em! One last thing, fuel tanks can be found all over the field. Try to get close enough to that structure in the center and see what's going on. If you do all of this and live, go to Hellscream!Hah... You're Not So Big Now!^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Hah... You're Not So Big Now!^Just a Few More Things...^^Test out Crafty's Ultra-Advanced Proto-Typical Shortening Blaster on 5 Magmoth Crushers or Mates of Magmothregar. After you have done so, return to her at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^That'll do her, chief! So, here's what I want ya to do.... Take my blaster and head north to Magmoth. If we're gonna have a chance at all against those monsters, we need to cut them down to size... so to speak. In order to gauge its effectiveness, I need you to slay the magnataur while the blaster's effects are still on it. Any of the crushers or mates will do, but don't bother with the offspring... they're too small to worry about.The Spire of Blood^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Vial of Fresh Blood^Snow Tracker Grumm^The Spire of Blood^^^Search the Spire of Blood for more information about the Vial of Fresh Blood.^As you inspect the captured blood vial, you realize its contents are still warm. The victim must have just been bled and may still be alive. What use would the Scourge have for blood? They've never shown an interest in live prisoners in the past. Perhaps if you can locate the source of the blood, you'll be able to discover what the Scourge is planning.Into the Mist^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Waltor of Pal'ea^Waltor of Pal'ea^Into the Mist^^^Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Kvaldir and recover 8 Tuskarr Relics.^Across the mist to the north you will find Garrosh's Landing. To the south are the ruins of my old home, Pal'ea. Both have been ransacked by an ancient force known as the Kvaldir. These fearsome savages slew all of my people without mercy and drove your people inland. All that remains of the tuskarr of Pal'ea are our personal effects, taken as relics by the Kvaldir. While we are not a vengeful race, justice must be served. The tuskarr relics must be returned to me. Enter the mist and find them...Burn in Effigy^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Waltor of Pal'ea^Waltor of Pal'ea^Into the Mist^^Seek Out Karuk!^Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the Tuskarr Torch to burn the Kvaldir ships at Pal'ea and Garrosh's Landing. You must destroy the following ships: The Serpent's Maw, The Kur Drakkar, Bor's Hammer and Bor's Anvil.^Tuskarr magic is similar to what your people call shamanism. While we serve the elements differently than you, the power that we are able to call forth is formidable. <Waltor waves a torch-like baton in front of you.> With this tuskarr torch I want you to return to the mist and strike at the Kvaldir vessels. You will find three of their vessels docked behind the mist at Garrosh's Landing, north of here, and one docked off the shores of Pal'ea, to the south. Burn their ships in effigy! For all to see!Plan B^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Hah... You're Not So Big Now!^^It Was The Orcs, Honest!^Collect 10 Warsong Outfits and a Warsong Banner. Bring them back to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^Okay, don't panic! The blaster might not've worked, but we still have options. <Crafty snaps her fingers.> We're going to divert attention away from the airstrip! To make this work, we'll need a few things first. <Wobblesprocket looks you up and down appraisingly.> Steeljaw's caravan, just to the west, stupidly took a shortcut through a taunka graveyard and was destroyed by their risen spirits. Head over there and get some outfits off of the dead orcs. Pick up one of their banners, too!Shatter the Orbs!^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Snow Tracker Grumm^Snow Tracker Junek^The Spire of Blood^^^Destroy 5 Blood Globes and report to Snow Tracker Junek at Taunka'le Village.^They're... bleeding the prisoners... putting the blood... in those globes. <Grumm's eyes close momentarily and he leans his head back.> The blood... taken up to necropolis... to feed blood prince... <Grumm gasps for breath.> P-promise... you'll... destroy blood... globes... bring word... to Junek. <The snow tracker collapses into unconsciousness.>Horn of the Ancient Mariner^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Waltor of Pal'ea^Waltor of Pal'ea^Horn of the Ancient Mariner^^^Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to bring him the Horn of the Ancient Mariner.^A Kvaldir lieutenant known as Orabus directed the initial incursion against my people at Pal'ea, He oversaw the destruction of both villages and then disappeared into the mist. In those early days there was talk of a horn that Orabus gifted to the Kvaldir mistweavers. This horn could be used to summon him should the need arise. We need to get that horn from the Kvaldir mistweavers and call forth Orabus. If he is destroyed, these savages might retreat. Seek out mistweavers at Pal'ea, to the south.Orabus the Helmsman^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Waltor of Pal'ea^Waltor of Pal'ea^Horn of the Ancient Mariner^^^Waltor of Pal'ea at the Coast of Echoes in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the Horn of the Ancient Mariner to summon Orabus the Helmsman. Once summoned, slay Orabus the Helmsman.^Take the horn and travel west to the Warsong Jetty. Make your way to the end of the jetty and blow into the horn. The sound should rouse Orabus. Slay the foul beast and return to me!Seek Out Karuk!^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Waltor of Pal'ea^Karuk^^Burn in Effigy^^Seek out Karuk at Riplash Strand.^A fellow survivor of Pal'ea known as Karuk has made his way to the main base of the Kvaldir in the Borean Tundra - far to the south where the snow was once bountiful. Karuk hides along the bluffs overlooking Riplash Strand. Seek out Karuk and let him know what you did for my people here at the Coast of Echoes. The safest route to Karuk is through your fortress. From Warsong Hold, take the road south and follow it around until you reach Riplash Strand.Sharing Intelligence^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Normantis^Librarian Donathan^Too Close For Comfort^^^Normantis has asked you to report to Librarian Donathan on Amber Ledge.^Thank you, <class>! The information you've extracted is of vital importance to the Kirin Tor. Return at once to Donathan as we make plans for the rescue of Lady Evanor.Escaping the Mist^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Mootoo the Younger^Elder Mootoo^^^^Follow Mootoo the Younger out of the mist. Speak to Elder Mootoo should you successfully save Mootoo the Younger.^I can hear the mist creatures outside. Their yells are driving me mad, but I dare not try to escape. And where would I even go? How long would it be until they caught up with me and executed me like the others? I wonder, how far has the mist crept, stranger? Has it overtaken this whole continent? Would you be willing to help me try and escape the mist? I think I can lead us back toward my father. I still sense his life spirit. He is close.Crocolisks in the City^70^All^Fishing^Old Man Barlo^Old Man Barlo^^^^Bring a Baby Crocolisk to Old Man Barlo. You can find him fishing northeast of Shattrath City by Silmyr Lake.^Hello <lad/lass>. I'm glad you've stopped by to talk to this old man--there's trouble back home. A traveling merchant recently sold a batch of baby crocolisks to some gullible children. Crocolisks are wild beasts, and many have escaped and now lurk in city waterways. Grab your strongest fishing pole and drop a line in Stormwind or Orgrimmar and bring one of the little devils back to me. I'm anxious to see one.Bait Bandits^70^All^Fishing^Old Man Barlo^Old Man Barlo^^^^Bring a Blackfin Darter to Old Man Barlo. You can find him fishing northeast of Shattrath City by Silmyr Lake.^You probably know all about the golden darter--they're fairly common in the rivers of Terokkar Forest and a delicacy for priests. But here's one you haven't heard of: the blackfin darter. The fish is notoriously crafty and difficult to catch. You have to pull your line at the last possible second, because they nibble at the bait before they take it. Drop your line in the rivers of Terokkar and bring me a blackfin darter. Avoid the lakes, as the blackfin only thrive in moving water.The One That Got Away^70^All^Fishing^Old Man Barlo^Old Man Barlo^^^^Catch the World's Largest Mudfish and bring it to Old Man Barlo. You can find him fishing northeast of Shattrath City by Silmyr Lake.^Figluster's mudfish is a surprisingly quick bottom feeder found in the waters of Nagrand. They grow their entire lives and are well known as fighters. Years ago, I caught what I'm certain was the world's biggest mudfish... until it snapped my line and escaped. A fisherman of your caliber doesn't need to be told what to do--your destiny awaits in the lakes of Nagrand.Shrimpin' Ain't Easy^70^All^Fishing^Old Man Barlo^Old Man Barlo^^^^Bring 10 Giant Freshwater Shrimp to Old Man Barlo. You can find him fishing northeast of Shattrath City by Silmyr Lake.^There's a lot of big fish in the Zangarmarsh lakes. Ever wonder what they eat? Shrimp. Giant freshwater shrimp. The Rokk tells me the dishes you can make with shrimp are nearly endless. But shrimp are too small to catch with a fishing line. So here's the trick: cut open the bloated barbed gill trout and you'll find a shrimp or two if you're lucky.Felblood Fillet^70^All^Fishing^Old Man Barlo^Old Man Barlo^^^^Bring a Monstrous Felblood Snapper to Old Man Barlo. You can find him fishing northeast of Shattrath City by Silmyr Lake.^This old man is going hunting soon. I'm gonna take down a mammoth shark off the coast of Azshara. The thing is, I need a toxin that'll stay on a spear tip while it's underwater. To make that kind of stuff, I need the glands from a poisonous fish: the felblood snapper. Such a vile fish only thrives in the waters of Hellfire Peninsula and Shadowmoon Valley. Bring me back a whopper and I'll be a happy old man.It Was The Orcs, Honest!^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Crafty Wobblesprocket^^Plan B^^While disguised as a Warsong orc, plant the Warsong Banner in the corpse of Magmothregar. Then, return with the disguise to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^With all of those outfits you, er, recovered, I fashioned a Warsong orc disguise. I had the genius idea of combining it with some old stuff that I had left hanging around from last Hallows' End, so it should be foolproof! Here, in this sack is the disguise and the banner you recovered. Head down into the bowels of Magmoth and slay the magnataur chieftain, Magmothregar. If you're going to convince them to turn their attention on the Warsong orcs, you'll need to plant the banner while disguised.A Race Against Time^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Donathan^Librarian Donathan^Too Close For Comfort^^^Donathan on Amber Ledge has tasked you with using the Beryl Shield Detonator to bring down the shield at Beryl Point. You are then to defeat Salrand and collect the key she holds.^So it's true. They have her. It's clear what must be done, <race>. She WILL be saved. I must remain here and aid in the rescue preparations. I call upon you again; this time to collect the prison key. All we know of this Salrand figure is that she cannot be harmed so long as her shield is intact. We've customized a special explosive that should strip her of this protection, allowing you to perform your duty. Return to me when you've collected the key. Hurry, <name>. Lady Evanor is suffering!Enlistment Day^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Recruitment Officer Blythe^General Arlos^^^A Time for Heroes^Meet with General Arlos inside the barracks in Valiance Keep.^You've come to enlist, right? Normally you'd have to stand in line like the other recruits. Normally you'd be out of luck because the recruitment ledger's gone missing and I can't process anyone until the new books get here. Fortunately for you, <name>, I've heard about you and what you did in Outland. To be honest, you're a cut above these poor saps. Lines aren't for you. Go to the barracks and speak to General Arlos. He'll be more than happy to meet with someone of your caliber.Get Me Outa Here!^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Bonker Togglevolt^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^^^^Escort Bonker Togglevolt to safety and then report in with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^I knew they'd send someone for me sooner or later... turned out to be later, of course. I came in here to parlay with the snobolds, but their main shaman, Kaganishu, decided instead that I'd make a tasty snack for Magmothregar. Wait... what?! They didn't send you?! DID THEY FORGET ABOUT ME?! Okay, you're here now and that's all that matters. As soon as you break this chain we'll make our way back to the airstrip. Then you can tell Fizzcrank I'm safely back. If he remembers me, that is.Sage Highmesa is Missing^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Greatmother Taiga^Sage Highmesa^Sage Highmesa is Missing^^^Find Sage Highmesa near the Dens of Dying.^There are many new mysteries walking the lands now. One of our sages, Highmesa, has foolishly gone north with only one longrunner to investigate something strange near the Dens of Dying. What are the dens, you ask? They are a sacred place to the magnataur, where they go in their old age to die. She saw something fall from the sky near them a few days ago. If you would be friend to the taunka, I would have you find and help her. She is not so stubborn that she will not accept your aid.A Proper Death^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Highmesa^Sage Highmesa^Sage Highmesa is Missing^^^Destroy 10 Plagued Magnataur and then return to Sage Highmesa south of The Dens of Dying.^The magnataur at the Dens of Dying have contracted a plague. We must find the cause, but first we must put them out of their misery. <race>, you must go north onto the slopes in front of us and destroy as many of the poor creatures as you can.Merciful Freedom^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Canarius^Shadowstalker Canarius^^Reinforcements Incoming...^^Shadowstalker Canarius at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to free 5 Scourge Prisoners.^The soldiers that they didn't kill are being held in cages scattered across this farmland. Through some thievery we've managed to find a few keys, but we're unable to get close enough to any prisoners without being attacked. We need your "talents" in securing those keys and freeing the prisoners. Bash in the brains of the necrolords and aberrations and take their keys. Use those keys to free Scourge prisoners.Stop the Plague^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Highmesa^Sage Highmesa^Sage Highmesa is Missing^^Find Bristlehorn, Fallen Necropolis^Sage Highmesa, standing just south of The Dens of Dying, has asked you to use Highmesa's Cleansing Seeds at a Den of Dying Plague Cauldron to neutralize it.^I'm convinced that the plague is being caused by something in the caves up there. <class>, I want you to take these seeds. I normally use them as a ward against the Scourge, though perhaps they can be used to disrupt whatever foulness is happening in the dens. Find the source of the plague and throw them into it.Find Bristlehorn^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Highmesa^Longrunner Bristlehorn^Find Bristlehorn^Stop the Plague^^Find Longrunner Bristlehorn at Talramas.^Bristlehorn should have returned by now. The other reason why we came up here was to investigate that Scourge structure to the west, which fell from the sky. He's impetuous and has likely gotten himself into trouble. <name>, go to that place and find him, please.Reforging the Key^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Donathan^Surristrasz^Too Close For Comfort^^Taking Wing^Donathan wants you to speak to Surristrasz on Amber Ledge.^Delays, delays... the one thing we cannot afford right now! As much as I hate to disturb Lord Surristrasz, he's our only hope of saving our beloved Evanor. Bring him the key fragments and hope that his mood is favorable. Hurry, <class>, our assault team is waiting.Taking Wing^71^All^Borean Tundra^Surristrasz^Warmage Anzim^Taking Wing^Reforging the Key^^Give Salrand's Key to Warmage Anzim when you are ready to free Evanor.^The key is forged anew. Now heed my counsel, <race>. Succeed in your endeavor or die trying, for if a single scale falls from one of my drakes I shall hold you personally accountable. Now, off with you.Rescuing Evanor^71^All^Borean Tundra^Warmage Anzim^Archmage Evanor^Taking Wing^^^Anzim on Amber Ledge wants you to fly with his war mages to free Lady Evanor at Beryl Point. You are then to report to her in the mage tower on Amber Ledge.^At last, we attack! Once we've cleared the platform I'll use the key. You are to ensure that Lady Evanor remains safe after her release. Hurry now, let us be off!Dragonspeak^71^All^Borean Tundra^Archmage Evanor^Surristrasz^Taking Wing^^^Lady Evanor has sent you to speak with Surristrasz on Amber Ledge.^I am aware of your recent deeds here, <name>, and again I thank you. As for this local menace, we've learned all we need to know from them. They'll be dealt with in short order. On now to more important issues.... Azeroth needs you. The region just west of here is the center of an urgent crisis. I'll leave the details to Lord Surristrasz. You must speak with him at once. Good luck, friend of Dalaran.Fallen Necropolis^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Highmesa^Sage Highmesa^^Stop the Plague^^Destroy 20 Scourge of any type at Talramas and the Festering Pools. Then, return to Sage Highmesa just to the south of The Dens of the Dying.^The fallen necropolis to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with Scourge. While you are at Talramas, <class>, I would ask that you dispatch all of the Lich King's servants that you find within and in the surrounding pools where it fell.Scouting the Sinkholes^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Greatfather Mahan^Greatfather Mahan^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Greatfather Mahan at Taunka'le Village wants you to use the Map of the Geyser Fields to mark the locations of the South Sinkhole, the Northwest Sinkhole, and the Northeast Sinkhole.^Can you feel the tremors in the earth? The Scourge's nerubians are on the move deep beneath the ground. They've emerged to the southwest in the Geyser Fields, and are harassing the patrols Chieftain Wintergale sent out. <The taunka elder offers you a worn map.> Perhaps a single person can succeed where the patrols have failed. Take this with you to the Geyser Fields and map out the locations of the Nerubian sinkholes.The Heart of the Elements^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Greatfather Mahan^Wind Tamer Barah^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Bring 5 Elemental Hearts to Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village.^Now that we know the exact locations of the nerubian sinkholes, we can collapse them to halt the Scourge offensive and cripple their force. Wind Tamer Barah knows a way to harness elementals to destroy the tunnels the Nerubians are using, but she will require your help. Southeast of the village, near the coast beyond the Frozen Reach, you'll find an area dominated by frozen earth elementals. The hearts of these elements are exactly what Wind Tamer Barah will need.The Warsong Farms^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Ickoris^Shadowstalker Ickoris^Untold Truths^^^Shadowstalker Ickoris at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to scout Warsong Granary, Torp's Farm, and Warsong Slaughterhouse.^According to Luther's notes the Scourge is now using this place as a breeding ground for those monsters you see lumbering across the field. <Ickoris shudders.> Those monsters were once orcs... tauren... We need more information before a plan can be devised. I want you to investigate three sites that are heavily trafficked by Scourge: the Warsong Granary, southwest of us, Torp's Farm, directly west of us, and the old Warsong Slaughterhouse, north of us. Return to me once you've scouted 'em out.The Doctor and the Lich-Lord^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Longrunner Bristlehorn^Sage Highmesa^Find Bristlehorn^^^Destroy Doctor Razorgrin and Lich-Lord Chillwinter. Then, return to Sage Highmesa just to the south of The Dens of Dying.^There are two... that must... be killed. The doctor and... the lich-lord... are above. Find them... destroy them... before.... ...it is too... late....Damned Filthy Swine^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Farmer Torp^Farmer Torp^Damned Filthy Swine^Reinforcements Incoming...^^Farmer Torp at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to kill 10 Unliving Swine.^Just look at 'em! My beautiful kodos are helpless to defend themselves against those filthy swine! I need you to buy me some time, <race>. I think I can cure the kodo of the sickness, but you need to keep the unliving swine off 'em, else there'll be nothin' left to cure! Get out there and send those swine to their graves - permanently!Return with the Bad News^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Highmesa^Greatmother Taiga^Find Bristlehorn^^^Speak with Greatmother Taiga at Taunka'le Village.^The greatmother will need to know, <name>. Will you please return to Taunka'le? Tell her that I will be following shortly.Bring 'Em Back Alive^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Farmer Torp^Farmer Torp^Damned Filthy Swine^^^Farmer Torp at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to rescue 8 Infected Kodo Beasts.^Take this riding snaffle, <name>. You'll notice that I've placed a tiny medicine dispenser in the mouthpiece. That thing will cure the infection as soon as a kodo bites down. Once you've cured the sick out of 'em, you'll need to ride 'em home. They'll be weak so you'll need to gently direct 'em here. Bring my babies back, <name>! One last thing, you've got ten minutes! That's how long the antidote will remain effective inside that snaffle.Check in With Bixie^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Mordle Cogspinner^Bixie Wrenchshanker^What's the Matter with the Transmatter?^^^Mordle Cogspinner has asked you to find Bixie Wrenchshanker to the south of The Dens of Dying.^You're a proven <hero /heroine>. I have another problem! My boss, Tinky, went east with Bixie Wrenchshanker and I CAN'T get the outgoing on this thing to work! Tinky's the only one that can fix it and we really need it working one-hundred percent. You think you could find them? Bixie said something about following some old magnataur to a place called The Dens of Dying. I'm guessing that's where you'll find them. You can catch a ride out there by talking with Kara Thricestar at the runway.Oh Great... Plagued Magnataur!^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Bixie Wrenchshanker^Bixie Wrenchshanker^What's the Matter with the Transmatter?^^^Kill 10 Plagued Magnataur and then return to Bixie Wrenchshanker to the south of The Dens of Dying.^Tinky and I came out here stalking some old magnataur. Apparently those caves up there are where they go to die. Of course, we had no idea that they were going to get plagued when they went in there. We can't have plagued things just roaming about; it's not healthy. Say, why don't you put down a number of those things while I figure out what our next step should be?There's Something Going On In Those Caves^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Bixie Wrenchshanker^Bixie Wrenchshanker^What's the Matter with the Transmatter?^^Rats, Tinky Went into the Necropolis!, Might As Well Wipe Out the Scourge^Bixie Wrenchshanker, skulking just to the south of The Dens of Dying, has asked you to use Bixie's Inhibiting Powder at a Den of Dying Plague Cauldron to neutralize it.^So, while you were out taking care of those plagued beasts, I took a peek inside the caves up there. There are cultists in there plaguing them! They have some sort of noxious concoction brewing in a cauldron. I have a powder that I normally use as an anti-poison, and I mixed it up with some other stuff. I think it'll neutralize their brew! Take it up to one of those caves and see if it works.The Horn of Elemental Fury^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Wind Tamer Barah^Wind Tamer Barah^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Reclaim the Lower Horn Half and Upper Horn Half from Chieftain Burblegoggle and Chieftain Gurgleboggle and bring them to Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village.^I can fashion the likeness of an elemental from these pieces of inanimate stone, but breathing life into it is different. For that, we'll need help and a bit of luck. Legend tells of an ancient artifact called the Horn of Elemental Fury, sought after by a great hero. I'll lend you a scroll with a copy of the tale. I don't know if the legend is true, but it's our best bet. If the legend is right, the parts of the horn may be in the Flood Plains surrounding the village to the north and southwest.Rats, Tinky Went into the Necropolis!^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Bixie Wrenchshanker^Tinky Wickwhistle^Rats, Tinky Went into the Necropolis!^There's Something Going On In Those Cave^^Find Tinky Wickwhistle inside Talramas.^I told Tinky not to go off on her own, but she just HAD to check out that crashed necropolis to the west. I'm 100% certain that those cultists came from inside that thing, which means I'm now 100% certain that Tinky's in trouble! She's the airstrip's number one engineer. Without her we're doomed! I'd find her myself, but one of those things got in a swipe on my leg before I could vanish again. <name>, if anyone can get her out, it's you!Might As Well Wipe Out the Scourge^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Bixie Wrenchshanker^Bixie Wrenchshanker^^There's Something Going On In Those Cave^^Destroy 20 Scourge of any type at Talramas and the Festering Pools. Then, return to Bixie Wrenchshanker just to the south of The Dens of the Dying.^If the cultists up in those caves survived the crash, then that fallen necropolis to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with Scourge. There're probably lots of them out in front of it in the pools, too! While you're at Talramas, <class>, do you think you could dispatch all of the Lich King's flunkies that you find there?I'm Stuck in this Damned Cage... But Not For Long!^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Tinky Wickwhistle^Tinky Wickwhistle^Rats, Tinky Went into the Necropolis!^^Let Bixie Know^Collect an Engine-Core Crystal, a Magical Gyroscope, and a Piloting Scourgestone. Deliver them to Tinky Wickwhistle at Talramas.^The cultists magicked me into this cage and there's no door to it. Little did they know that I'm the chief transmatter engineer for the airstrip! With your help, and a little elbow-grease, I won't be in here for long. I'm going to need an engine-core crystal from one of the ghouls in here, a magical gyroscope from their doctor, and a piloting scourgestone from the lich-lord up top. With all of that stuff, I should be able to make a port device to get back to Fizzcrank's and escape the gnome way!Let Bixie Know^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Tinky Wickwhistle^Bixie Wrenchshanker^^I'm Stuck in this Damned Cage... But Not^Back to the Airstrip^Speak with Bixie Wrenchshanker just south of The Dens of Dying.^My evil twin's out there somewhere now. I'm pretty sure that she's not back at the airstrip. In fact, wherever she ended up, it's colder there than here. But I could only 'feel' her for a moment. Oh well, I'll reconfigure this thing and port myself back to the airstrip soon enough. In the meantime, do you think you could go east and let Bixie know that I'll meet her back there? Thanks, <name>!Back to the Airstrip^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Bixie Wrenchshanker^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^^Let Bixie Know^^Speak with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle at Fizzcrank Airstrip in Borean Tundra.^Okay, I think I'm going to start making my way back to the airstrip, too. Of course, I'm moving a little slower with this leg injury. Say, do you think you could get there ahead of me and pass on the good news to Ol' Fizzcrank? I bet anything that there'll be a reward in it for you. Thanks, <name>!King Mrgl-Mrgl^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Supply Master Taz'ishi^King Mrgl-Mrgl^King Mrgl-Mrgl^^^Speak with King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat.^Dis is gonna sound weird, <class>, but dere be a murloc askin' for our help! He goes by da name of King Mrgl-Mrgl, leader of da Winterfin murlocs. Him and his people been run outa dere village and wantin' you to come save dem. You find him by headin' west and go down da cliffs. He hangin' out on da south side of da Winterfin Retreat.Get to Getry^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Ickoris^Shadowstalker Getry^Untold Truths^^Foolish Endeavors^Find Shadowstalker Getry at Warsong Farms.^The Scourge agent that's overseeing the abduction and transformation of Horde soldiers into undead monsters is using the northwest farm as a spawning glade. Shadowstalker Getry has been staking out that monster for the past week and has gathered some vital information that might allow us to end this menace. Get to Getry and see if you can help him put a stop to this Scourge assembly line. You'll find Getry at the abandoned tower on the northwest border of these farms.King Mrgl-Mrgl^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Mordle Cogspinner^King Mrgl-Mrgl^King Mrgl-Mrgl^^^Speak with King Mrgl-Mrgl at Winterfin Retreat.^This is the weirdest thing, <class>, but there's a murloc asking for our help! He goes by the name of King Mrgl-Mrgl, leader of the Winterfin murlocs. It would seem that he and his people have been run out of their village and they want someone to come save them. That someone is you! You'll find Winterfin Retreat, and the king, by heading west down the road until you come to the cliffs. Head down to the water line near the Blistering Pool.Foolish Endeavors^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Shadowstalker Getry^Garrosh Hellscream^Foolish Endeavors^Get to Getry^Nork Bloodfrenzy's Charge^Help Getry defeat Varidus the Flenser at Warsong Farms.^This is madness. How do they expect us to take on a Scourge necrolord and an unknown number of his minions? <Getry sighs.> If Ickoris sent you he must think that you are capable of great feats. Perhaps you will call down a miracle today, eh? When you're ready we will descend and face Varidus. If we make it out of this mess in one piece, report back to Hellscream in Warsong Hold.The Collapse^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Wind Tamer Barah^Wind Tamer Barah^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village wants you to collapse the Nerubian sinkholes using the Horn of Elemental Fury and defeat Lord Kryxix.^I have created and bound Alluvius using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the Geyser Fields. The quake Alluvius will unleash should collapse the Nerubian tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the Nerubian commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will.Distress Call^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Airman Skyhopper^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^Distress Call^Plug the Sinkholes^^Speak with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^Oh good, you're <name>, right? We need your help up north at Fizzcrank Airstrip, like yesterday! The magnataur, and the Scourge... and the pumping station! It's madness I tell you, madness! You've got to head up there and talk to old man Fullthrottle a.s.a.p.!The Mechagnomes^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^Jinky Wingnut^Distress Call^^Dirty, Stinkin' Snobolds!, What's the Matter with the Transmatter?^Listen to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle's tale and then find Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^Now that you're here, it's time for me to tell you the full story of what's going on. After you've heard my tale, go outside and find my second-in-command, Jinky Wingnut. She'll handle everything from here on out.Nork Bloodfrenzy's Charge^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Garrosh Hellscream^Warden Nork Bloodfrenzy^Foolish Endeavors^^^Speak to Warden Nork Bloodfrenzy at Warsong Hold in Borean Tundra.^While you have done much to secure our foothold in these frozen wastes, other dangers still lurk in the shadows. I want you to assist Warden Nork Bloodfrenzy, stationed at the internment camp just outside and immediately southeast of Warsong Hold. Seek him out and offer your assistance for prisoner transport and exchange. You are dismissed, <name>.What's the Matter with the Transmatter?^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Mordle Cogspinner^Mordle Cogspinner^What's the Matter with the Transmatter?^The Mechagnomes^^Collect 15 Fizzcrank Spare Parts and deliver them to Mordle Cogspinner at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^There're spare parts strewn all over to the east in the Scalding Pools, the Geyser Fields... heck, probably even up on the pumping station still, too. Bring back a whole bunch. Maybe then I'll be able to get outgoing teleport on this thing working, not to mention getting the incoming transmatter ports aligned. I'd hate to see another accident....Coward Delivery... Under 30 Minutes or it's Free^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Warden Nork Bloodfrenzy^Scout Tungok^Foolish Endeavors^^^Take the Alliance Deserter to the crossroads east of Warsong Hold and fire your Warsong Flare Gun to signal the Alliance.^We're seeing more deserters show up at our gates with each passing day. We simply do not have enough room to keep all of these maggots caged up. Especially not if we want to keep the pigs happy. <Nork snorts as he laughs.> I want you to escort one of these cowards to the crossroads east of here and fire this flare gun. One of their captains will show up when they see the flare and take the coward off your hands. Report to Scout Tungok on the east road once the delivery has been made.Re-Cursive^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Jinky Wingnut^Jinky Wingnut^Distress Call^^Finding Pilot Tailspin^Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip has asked you to use the Re-Cursive Transmatter Injection on 6 Fizzcrank Mechagnomes.^If you listened to the old man, then you know that we have gnomes out there that were changed. Gearmaster Mechazod infected them with something that reversed the "Curse of the Flesh", and now they're robots! We think we have a way to re-curse them back to normal. We want you to take this re-cursive transmatter injection and use it on the corpses of any mechagnomes you come across. We're hoping that this stuff will cure them and allow us to lock onto them to port 'em out of there. Whaddya say, <name>?Scouting the Sinkholes^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Abner Fizzletorque^Abner Fizzletorque^Scouting the Sinkholes^Give Fizzcrank the News^^Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to use the Map of the Geyser Fields to mark the locations of the South Sinkhole, the Northwest Sinkhole, and the Northeast Sinkhole.^Fizzcrank sent out an aerial surveillance team to map the Nerubian sinkholes in the southern part of the Geyser Fields, but they haven't yet returned. I can't afford to wait any longer for their information, so I'm going to need someone to check out the sinkholes on foot. I understand the dangers involved, and I'll compensate you accordingly. Take this map with you and record the vital information about each of the sinkholes you encounter out there.Vermin Extermination^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Scout Tungok^Scout Tungok^Foolish Endeavors^^^Scout Tungok at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill 8 Bloodspore Harvesters, 5 Bloodspore Firestarters and 2 Bloodspore Roasters.^Perhaps you'd be interested in helping me clean up these fields? They're littered with dirty little rat men! Kobolds, snobolds, whatever you wanna call 'em, they're all over the damned place. The stink alone is making my life hell! Take care of the vermin for me and I'll make it worth your while, <name>.Fueling the Project^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Abner Fizzletorque^Abner Fizzletorque^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to collect 8 Barrels of Oil using the Portable Oil Collector.^I plan to build a machine that will collapse the tunnels the Scourge is using to deploy their Nerubians, but with the main drilling rig out of order, we'll have to collect the fuel for the device some other way. Out in the Geyser Fields to the southeast, small pools of oil bubble up away from the main rig. If you can collect enough of the oil from those pools, I can make a crude fuel to power the machine. Simply deploy the collector near the rig, and it will pump and store the oil in its tank.The Wondrous Bloodspore^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Bloodmage Laurith^Bloodmage Laurith^The Wondrous Bloodspore^^^Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 10 Bloodspore Carpels.^We are witnessing something amazing here, <race>. A whole undiscovered ecology lives and breathes not more than a few paces from us! I surmise it is the bloodspore plant that sets this environment abuzz. I have collected some pollen from the nearby male species of bloodspore plant but still lack female receptors for pollination. Fetch me a bushel of the bloodspore carpels. You'll find them near the larger plants surrounding us. Be wary of their guardians! The kobolds won't give them up easily!Pollen from the Source^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Bloodmage Laurith^Bloodmage Laurith^The Wondrous Bloodspore^^^Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 5 Bloodspore Moth Pollen.^It's obvious! The bloodspore moths are the entities responsible for pollination on these plains. It must be something that happens within the moth's internal system that acts as a catalyst for this pollen to work. It's all starting to make sense now, <name>. That's why the kobolds don't kill the moths and instead go to great lengths to protect them! Those stupid little rats have it all figured out! Well we'll just have to get our own moth pollen! What do you say? Fetch me some in the name of science?A Bot in Mammoth's Clothing^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Abner Fizzletorque^Abner Fizzletorque^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to bring him 6 Thick Mammoth Hides.^I've reconfigured the skeleton of an old bot to create an earthquake large enough to collapse the tunnels, but the machinery is delicate and sensitive to Northrend's biting cold. I've devised a means of insulating it using the thickest hides of the native mammoths. They roam the plains south of the airstrip and adjacent to the Geyser Fields. Bring back enough of the hides for me to finish the machine and then we'll be able to unleash it on the Nerubians!A Suitable Test Subject^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Bloodmage Laurith^Bloodmage Laurith^The Wondrous Bloodspore^^^Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra has asked that you use the Pollinated Bloodspore Flower and allow her to observe the results.^<Laurith looks you over as if to size you up.> So we've got this pollinated bloodspore flower and nobody to test its effects on. Say, would you perhaps be interested in rubbing this on your skin and letting me observe? What's the worst that could happen anyway? Don't you worry, <name>! Just take this sample and rub it all over your face.The Invasion of Gammoth^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Bloodmage Laurith^Primal Mighthorn^The Wondrous Bloodspore^^^Speak to Primal Mighthorn at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra.^Hellscream assigned Mighthorn and I with the daunting task of magnataur extermination on the southern front of Warsong Hold. With us came an entire platoon of seasoned Horde soldiers. Our initial foray into the nearby magnataur dens proved quite unsuccessful as our entire squad was wiped out by the lair defenders. We're the only ones left... We aren't scientists or researchers. We're soldiers of the Horde, just like you. Soldiers on a mission that cannot fail... Speak to Primal Mighthorn now.Gammothra the Tormentor^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Primal Mighthorn^Primal Mighthorn^The Wondrous Bloodspore^^^Slay Gammothra and return the Head of Gammothra to Primal Mighthorn at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra.^Magnataur live in prides, much like lions: one or two dominant males and several females along with their offspring. In the case of Gammoth, the magnataur den west of here, Gammothra is the leader. It is Gammothra that controls this magnataur population and therefore it is Gammothra that must be slain to prevent any type of magnataur uprising. Take this pouch of crushed bloodspore flower to Gammoth. Use the powder from the pouch to weaken Gammothra and then slay him! Return his head to me as proof.Trophies of Gammoth^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Primal Mighthorn^Garrosh Hellscream^The Wondrous Bloodspore^^^Take the Head of Gammothra to Garrosh Hellscream in Warsong Hold.^We cannot take all of the credit for this Horde victory, <name>. It was you who risked your life to test the bloodspore and it was you who ultimately put an end to Gammothra. Honor us by returning to Warsong Hold and presenting the head of Gammothra to Lord Hellscream.Deploy the Shake-n-Quake!^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Abner Fizzletorque^Abner Fizzletorque^Scouting the Sinkholes^^^Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to use the Shake-n-Quake 5000 to collapse the Nerubian tunnels and defeat Lord Kryxix.^Behold, the machine that will save us from the Nerubian threat! <Abner beams with pride as he presents the finished bot.> Take this remote control with you, and go out to the southernmost of the Nerubian sinkholes in the Geyser Fields. Use the remote to activate the Shake-n-Quake 5000. It will do the rest on its own. Don't be surprised if the quake it creates attracts the attention of a Nerubian leader. In fact, it would be a great opportunity to finish off the Nerubian offensive.Massive Moth Omelet?^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Massive Glowing Egg^Bloodmage Laurith^^^^Take the Massive Glowing Egg to Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra.^This egg was obviously important to somebody, as the corpse nearby can attest. As you look the egg over you notice that it has already been tagged for shipment to the Bloodspore Plains, care of Bloodmage Laurith. That's just east of here! Collect the egg and take it to the expectant Bloodmage.Finding Pilot Tailspin^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^^Re-Cursive^A Little Bit of Spice^Locate Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle in the Geyser Fields.^I should've flown the mission myself. It's not that I don't trust Tailspin. Far from it. Heck, he was the best wingman I ever flew with. No, it's just that it's my responsibility to lead a mission of such import. I sent Tailspin out with our fastest recon squadron to gather information about the Nerubian infestation in the middle of the Geyser Fields. The last report we received placed his squadron in the pools to the far south and just west of the Nerubian sinkholes. Find Tailspin, <name>.A Little Bit of Spice^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^A Little Bit of Spice^Finding Pilot Tailspin^^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle in the Scalding Pools wants you to gather 4 Gorloc Spice Pouches.^The wolves have been pawing through the wreckage ever since the crash and I'm afraid they consumed the microfilm from our mission in the process. I have a plan to recover that microfilm, but I need your help to make it work. To the south and east, in the Flood Plains, live creatures called gorlocs. They prepare their foods with noxious spices, which would sicken any other creature. If you can gather enough of the spice pouches from gorloc steam belchers or gorloc waddlers, I can make the wolf bait.A Time for Heroes^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^General Arlos^Sergeant Hammerhill^A Time for Heroes^Enlistment Day^^Report to Sergeant Hammerhill at Valiance Keep.^It's good to have you among us, <name>. We've all heard of your past deeds. As you know, King Wrynn is moving great armies into Northrend to meet those of Arthas. But armies are nothing without true heroes to inspire and lead them. I want you to be that hero for my men. Fight alongside them against the Scourge that lays siege to our stronghold. Report to Sergeant Hammerhill outside the inner hold. Valiance Keep cannot fall. The future of our campaign depends on it.Lupus Pupus^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^A Little Bit of Spice^^^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle in the Scalding Pools wants you to bring him 8 pieces of Microfilm.^Whatever you do, don't eat this bait yourself. Just set it down in the vicinity of an oil-soaked wolf. If they're desperate enough to eat the microfilm, they'll come running when they smell the bait. Simply wait for nature to take its course and then all you need to do is search the, uh... byproduct for the film. I'd offer you my special lupus pupus scupus for the job, but I left it back at the airstrip. I'm afraid you'll have to conduct the... err... search the old-fashioned way.The Ultrasonic Screwdriver^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^The Ultrasonic Screwdriver^Crafty Wobblesprocket^The Ultrasonic Screwdriver^^^Deliver the Ultrasonic Screwdriver to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^The unit you just dismantled had this inside of its mechanical innards. It looks pretty complicated... certainly someone back at the airstrip would want to take a look at it. Maybe Crafty Wobblesprocket?Master and Servant^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Crafty Wobblesprocket^Crafty Wobblesprocket^The Ultrasonic Screwdriver^^^Use the Ultrasonic Screwdriver to reprogram 15 robots and then return to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^The Ultrasonic Screwdriver is the ultimate tool. It can do anything to mechanical stuff! Head back into the pools and dismantle a number of Mechazod's robots. Then all you have to do is use the screwdriver on their remains, and I'm betting that they'll turn to our side, for a short time anyway. I'm pretty sure it won't work on the mechagnomes, so don't even bother with them. Oh, and if you want to take anything from the robot's insides, you'll want to do so before using the screwdriver!Traversing the Rift^71^All^Borean Tundra^Surristrasz^Archmage Berinand^Taking Wing^^^Surristrasz wants you to travel to Coldarra. Once there, you are to speak with Archmage Berinand.^I've been mindful of your efforts, mortal. Do not feign surprise. Surely you've felt my eye upon you. The time has come to peel back a layer of darkness from your mind. There are stark truths that you have grown ready to accept. Before hearing the tale, you shall be shown firsthand what we face. Put your affairs in order, <class>....Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Jinky Wingnut^Jinky Wingnut^Distress Call^^^Dismantle Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder, and then report back to Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip.^Okay, I think we're ready for the penultimate assault... before you can bring down Mechazod, you're going to have to dismantle his lieutenants first! You'll find Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder at the West Point, North Point, Mid Point and South Point stations, respectively. To get them to show up, just turn the valves at the stations to mess up whatever they're trying to do out there. You can't miss the places, they all have spinning lights.A Soldier in Need^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Medic Hawthorn^Medic Hawthorn^^^^Medic Hawthorn, outside of Valiance Keep, wants you to go inside the Stormbreaker's hold and retrieve Hawthorn's Anti-Venom from a crate of First Aid Supplies.^You there! Please, I need your help. This soldier will succumb to the cryptfiends' venom unless we act immediately. I've managed to slow down the poison, but without a suitable supply of antidote I cannot counteract it. I was promised a new shipment of anti-venom in the Stormbreaker's most recent trip from the south. Go inside its hold and search for a chest of first aid supplies. Hurry, <class>! We can't afford to lose any more men unnecessarily.Notify Arlos^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Admiral Cantlebree^General Arlos^^Cultists Among Us^Enemies of the Light, A Diplomatic Mission^Speak to General Arlos inside the Inner Hold at Valiance Keep.^We must notify General Arlos at once. I've known the captain for a long time and, believe me, he is one of the more careful ones. Who knows how many cultists have been smuggled into our settlements in Northrend in other ships? This could be disastrous.Enemies of the Light^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Harbinger Vurenn^Harbinger Vurenn^Enemies of the Light^Notify Arlos^^Harbinger Vurenn wants you to fight the Cultist Necrolytes near Farshire to the north of Valiance Keep and retrieve the Cultist Communique from them.^Not so fast there. I don't know about you, <class>, but I was hardly convinced by the general's words. They rung unsure... as if they were not his own. Something's amiss here. All of our efforts to collaborate have been blocked and delayed. It is time we took a more independent approach. If we're to learn more about the cultists inside the keep... perhaps we should investigate those outside. Intelligence reports a small group of them aiding the Scourge north of here. See if they carry any clues.Further Investigation^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Harbinger Vurenn^Vindicator Yaala^Enemies of the Light^^^Bring the Cultist Communique to Vindicator Yaala inside the inn in Valiance Keep.^I'm afraid this is a matter I must delegate to one of my operatives... someone who can work in secret. Keep the evidence with you and take it to Vindicator Yaala inside the inn. Tell her I sent you and speak of this matter to no one else. We do not know who might be working for the cult.The Hunt is On^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Vindicator Yaala^Vindicator Yaala^Enemies of the Light^^^Vindicator Yaala wants you to use the Oculus of the Exorcist in three different locations in Valiance Keep to uncover and defeat Cult of the Damned members.^I've made it my business to learn as much as possible about the vile death cult, including their secret language. Vurenn was right. The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen. Take this oculus. Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura. Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens.Emergency Protocol: Section 8.2, Paragraph C^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^A Little Bit of Spice^^^Recover 6 Fizzcrank Pilot Insignia from the bodies of Fizzcrank Recon Pilots and return them to Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle in the Scalding Pools.^Injured or not, as squadron commander, I'm responsible for locating and returning the insignia of all fallen pilots under my command. In all the years I've flown with Fizzcrank, we've never failed to return the signet of a pilot. My injuries make it dangerous for me to stray far from the safety of the wreckage, but perhaps you would be willing to help me recover the insignia? In the meantime, I'll make preparations to carry out my final duty as squadron commander.Emergency Protocol: Section 8.2, Paragraph D^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^A Little Bit of Spice^^^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle wants you to scuttle the Eastern Wreck, a Southern Wreck, and a Northwestern Wreck.^There's only one more thing left to do before I can finally return to the airstrip and make my report. Section 8.2, paragraph D of the emergency protocol requires me to scuttle as much of the wreckage as possible, in order to prevent our technology from falling into enemy hands. I'll give you my torch if you agree to help me complete this last duty. I don't want to think about what the Horde's goblin allies will do if these machines fall into their hands.The Siege^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Sergeant Hammerhill^Sergeant Hammerhill^A Time for Heroes^^^Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to kill 6 Crypt Crawlers in the Sands of Nasam outside of Valiance Keep.^Well, well, well. It's good to see Arlos bring out the big guns. Don't get me wrong - our lads are doing the best they can, but someone of your renown fighting alongside them could really turn the tides for us. I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out against these undead Nerubians. What do you say you get out there and kill me some creepers? Show these boys how it's done.The Gearmaster^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Jinky Wingnut^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^Distress Call^^^Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle.^Gearmaster Mechazod is insane! He says that he offers us immortality by removing this so-called 'Curse of the Flesh', but what he's really making are robotic slaves! <name>, we're pretty certain that he's still at the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the east. The last we saw of him, he was in the command hut up top. Go up there and research his stuff. You must confront Mechazod if gnomes everywhere,... no, everyone everywhere, are to stay alive!Unfit for Death^72^All^Borean Tundra^Zaza^Zaza^Unfit for Death^A Mission Statement^^Zaza at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the Pile of Fake Furs to trap 8 Nesingwary Trappers.^Just south of us the caribou used to roam freely, peacefully. Then Nesingwary showed up and everything changed. Now the caribou are in a perpetual state of frenzy, always in a panic. They are stalked by the hunters and trappers hidden in the field. Nesingwary's executioners are unfit for death. They must feel the torture that they put the caribou through! Take this pile of fake furs and lay it upon their caribou traps to the south. Watch as the hunters are caught in their own deadly traps!Ears of Our Enemies^72^All^Borean Tundra^Arch Druid Lathorius^Arch Druid Lathorius^^A Mission Statement^Can't Get Ear-nough..., The Assassination of Harold Lane^Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra has said that he will reward you should you bring him 15 Nesingwary Lackey Ears.^Whether they be treasure seekers or bloodthirsty hunters of the wastes, any being that supports Nesingwary and dares to strike at our beloved wildlife shall be considered an enemy of D.E.H.T.A. Should you slay these filthy Nesingwary sympathizers, bring me proof of their demise and you shall be rewarded with a blessing from the druids of D.E.H.T.A.Can't Get Ear-nough...^72^All^Borean Tundra^Arch Druid Lathorius^Arch Druid Lathorius^^Ears of Our Enemies^^Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Outpost in the Borean Tundra has said that he will reward you should you bring him 15 Nesingwary Lackey Ears.^Whether they be treasure seekers or bloodthirsty hunters of the wastes, any being that supports Nessingwary and does dare strike at our beloved wildlife shall be considered an enemy of D.E.H.T.A. Should you slay these filthy Nesingwary sympathizers, bring me proof of their demise and you shall be rewarded with a blessing from the druids of D.E.H.T.A.The Culler Cometh^72^All^Borean Tundra^Zaza^Zaza^Unfit for Death^^The Assassination of Harold Lane^Zaza at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Karen the Culler.^Near the southern end of this bluff is where you will find the treacherous leader of the caribou trappers. She is a savage like no other, making a mockery out of the carcasses of the slain animals: drinking from their blood and howling to the moons! Find this murderer, Karen, and end her worthless existence. Prepare yourself properly, <name>. Karen the Culler has indulged in the riches that Nesingwary has lavished upon her! She will be well armed and guarded by lackeys.Happy as a Clam^72^All^Borean Tundra^Hierophant Cenius^Hierophant Cenius^Happy as a Clam^A Mission Statement^^Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill 10 Loot Crazed Divers.^To the west of us you will find Lake Kum'uya. It is, as far as we know, the only freshwater giant clam habitat in the world. Of course Nesingwary's lackeys are now using the lake as a giant pearl farm. They must be stopped! A lesson must be taught to those that would think to endanger an entire species. Go to Lake Kum'uya and locate the loot crazed divers. Slay them until the water runs red! Return to me when a proper example has been made!The Abandoned Reach^72^All^Borean Tundra^Hierophant Cenius^Hierophant Liandra^Happy as a Clam^^^Seek out Hierophant Liandra at the Abandoned Reach.^We have just gotten word from Liandra that mercenaries hired by Nesingwary are moving goods off the beach and onto the main Nesingwary shipping vessel. No doubt they plan on making a fortune from their murderous trade! She has asked that we send assistance to the Abandoned Reach, directly south of here on the beachfront of the Borean Tundra. Make haste, Liandra awaits you there!Not On Our Watch^72^All^Borean Tundra^Hierophant Liandra^Hierophant Liandra^Happy as a Clam^^^Hierophant Liandra at the Abandoned Reach in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 12 Shipments of Animal Parts.^Strewn across this beach, amidst the flotsam and jetsam, are crates and sacks of animal parts. It would seem that Nesingwary is in cahoots with the Northsea Freebooters. Those dirty pirates are transporting the goods that Nesingwary's murderous lackeys gather offshore. No doubt they will end up in the homes and on the backs of wealthy, unscrupulous individuals across Azeroth. This won't happen. Not on our watch. Bring me all shipments that you find upon this beach. They'll never have them!The Nefarious Clam Master...^72^All^Borean Tundra^Hierophant Liandra^Hierophant Cenius^Happy as a Clam^^The Assassination of Harold Lane^Slay Clam Master K and return to Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment.^It's despicable, really, to anoint one's self as the "Clam Master," as if they hold mastery over the creatures of the sea. None may make such claims! This "Clam Master" must be found and slain. He was last seen at the wreckage just off the coast of the Abandoned Reach. Find him and kill him. Once this is done, return to Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment, north of here, and let her know that the mission was a success.Give Fizzcrank the News^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle^Fizzcrank Fullthrottle^A Little Bit of Spice^^Scouting the Sinkholes^Make your way back to Fizzcrank Airstrip and speak with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle.^Would you be willing to head back to the airstrip and let Fizzcrank know that I'll be along shortly to give my formal report? I've got to deal with the wreckage of my flying machine, and then I'll be on my way. I'll be certain that Fizzcrank knows that he has you to thank for my survival and the recovery effort. I only wonder what the old man would've done himself if he'd been flying with us. I miss those days.Gaining the Advantage^70^All^Shattrath City^Emissary Mordin^Emissary Mordin^^^^Bring 8 Nether Residue to Emissary Mordin in Shattrath City.^The troops of the Shattered Sun Offensive will need every advantage they can get to beat back the allies of Kil'Jaeden. My colleagues in Stormwind have created oils which will strengthen the blades and armor of our troops. The key ingredient, nether residue, pervades Outland -- if you know where to look. Any master herbalist, skinner, or miner who knows the signs can gather it while plying <his/her> trade. Those herbs, ores, and beasts native to Outland may all bear the residue.Help Those That Cannot Help Themselves^72^All^Borean Tundra^Arch Druid Lathorius^Arch Druid Lathorius^Help Those That Cannot Help Themselves^A Mission Statement^^Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to use the D.E.H.T.A. Trap Smasher to free 8 Mammoth Calves.^They're majestic beasts, aren't they? <Lathorius points towards the mammoths of the northern tundra.> With each passing day their numbers diminish. Demons that call themselves hunters slay the beasts for sport and riches. <Lathorius' face contorts with anger.> It's the whimpers that drive me to madness, <name>. You can hear them, carried by the wind. The mammoth calves, trapped in the hunters' vile traps, call out to us. Take this hammer and smash those traps. Free the calves!Sunfury Attack Plans^70^All^Netherstorm^Lord Torvos^Lord Torvos^^^^Lord Torvos in Shattrath wants you to capture the Sunfury Attack Plans.^As we press the offensive on Quel'Danas, we've discovered that Kael'thas' minions are planning a counterattack. By ordering the Sunfury blood elves, based in Netherstorm, to attack our operations in Outland, he hopes to draw troops and attention away from the Sunwell. We must not allow this to happen, <name>. Each and every blade is needed on the front lines. Go to Netherstorm and capture their attack plans. Any of the Sunfury blood elves up there could be in possession of the plans. Good luck, <name>.Khu'nok Will Know^72^All^Borean Tundra^Arch Druid Lathorius^Khu'nok the Behemoth^Help Those That Cannot Help Themselves^^^Take the Orphaned Mammoth Calf to Khu'nok the Behemoth in the Borean Tundra.^Although you have acted valiantly in freeing the trapped calves, many of them will still die. You see, without a caretaker, these calves must fend for themselves in the wild. But there is a way! Hope yet remains! North of here in the mammoth fields, bordering the Scalding Pools, you will find Khu'nok the Behemoth: a mammoth as wise as he is ancient. Take this mammoth orphan and present it to Khu'nok. He will know what to do.Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer^72^All^Borean Tundra^Khu'nok the Behemoth^Arch Druid Lathorius^Help Those That Cannot Help Themselves^^The Assassination of Harold Lane^Kill Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer and recover Kaw's War Halberd. Deliver Kaw's War Halberd to Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra.^You cannot defeat the being responsible for the slaughter of my kind by yourself. The mammoths of the tundra will help you! Venture forth to the plains and find a mammoth bull. He will allow you to mount him and control his movements and actions. Ride upon his back and find Kaw, north of here at Kaw's Roost. Together, you will be the instrument of Kaw's demise. Destroy Kaw's armies and take from Kaw his coveted war halberd. Return to Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment should you succeed.The Multiphase Survey^70^Alliance^Nagrand^Harbinger Haronem^Harbinger Haronem^^^^Harbinger Haronem in Shattrath City wants you to use the Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles to take 6 Multiphase Readings.^I'm sure that 'gnomish inventor' is a crackpot. He was babbling about some dark distortions that have begun to appear in the Spirit Fields around Oshu'gun in Nagrand. According to him, these, uh, multiphase... um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the Sunwell. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings?Load'er Up!^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Fezzix Geartwist^Fezzix Geartwist^^^The Power of the Elements^Help Jenny make her way from the crash site to Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village without losing all her cargo.^Have you seen the flying machines buzzing around? That's gnomish innovation at its finest. I've long waited to get my hands on some of their technology and a perfect opportunity has presented itself. One of their recon wings crashed in the Scalding Pools, in the southwest part of the Geyser Fields. Blow this whistle near one of the crashed machines and my trusty mule, Jenny will answer. She'll follow you and carry the salvage, but you must keep her safe. She'll begin to drop the cargo if attacked.Ned, Lord of Rhinos...^72^All^Borean Tundra^Killinger the Den Watcher^Killinger the Den Watcher^^A Mission Statement^The Assassination of Harold Lane^Killinger the Den Watcher at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Nedar, Lord of Rhinos and his companion, "Lunchbox."^West of here, on the high bluffs above Lake Kum'uya, roams a despicable being known as Nedar. The self proclaimed "Lord of Rhinos" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against Ned's cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Ned has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard. It is a rare thing that D.E.H.T.A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Ned's tainted rhino must be disposed of... Kill them both and return to me.Adversarial Blood^70^All^Skettis^Hazzik^Hazzik^Hazzik's Bargain^^Terokk's Downfall, Tokens of the Descendants^Find the Skull Piles in the middle of the summoning circles of Skettis. Summon and defeat each of the descendants by using 10 Time-Lost Scrolls at the Skull Pile. Return to Hazzik at Blackwind Landing.^The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book: Gezzarak the Huntress, Karrog the crystal giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vakkiz the Windrager. They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world. You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa to call them forth at the summoning circles in Skettis. These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends.Emergency Supplies^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Crashed Recon Pilot^Fezzix Geartwist^^^^Collect 7 Gnomish Emergency Toolkits from the bodies of crashed Fizzcrank Recon Pilots and bring them to Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village.^Rifling through the dead gnome's possessions, you come across a small packet filled with rations, tools, and a handy roll of gnomish duct tape. The contents of these kits might prove helpful to Fezzix Geartwist when it comes time for him to reassemble the wreckage of the gnomish flying machines. Bringing a few of these kits to Fezzix might just be worth a nice bonus.Ride to Taunka'le Village^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Ambassador Talonga^Sage Earth and Sky^Ride to Taunka'le Village^Taking Back Mightstone Quarry^^Speak with Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.^<race>, the chieftain is making me wait... time that Taunka'le does not have! There has been talk of your prowess. Rather than wait for Garrosh to send help, I ask you to go and help my people. Taunka'le village lies far to the northeast. Follow the road east out of the hold, turning north at the intersection. Not long after, you will come to another intersection. Follow the path east, passing south and then east of the great pools along the flood plains. Speak with Sage Earth and Sky when you arrive.Death From Above^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Sergeant Hammerhill^Sergeant Hammerhill^A Time for Heroes^^^Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to use the Reinforced Net to help you slay 6 Scourged Flamespitters outside of Valiance Keep.^We're doing a good job of holding the front lines against these bugs. Some of these cheeky fiends, however, can fly over the aforementioned front lines and are really beating down on our inner defenses. I've requisitioned reinforced fishing nets from our civilian ships. If you've got a good enough throwing arm, they'll help you knock the enemy out of the sky. Thin their numbers so that our defenses can hold the keep.What Are They Up To?^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Earth and Sky^Sage Earth and Sky^Ride to Taunka'le Village^^^Investigate the area surrounding the Fizzcrank Pumping Station. Then, return to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.^The gnomes have run into some trouble in the pools to the west. It serves them right as they have been fouling up the land with their so-called inventions. I want you to go out to their pumping station and observe what has befallen them. Return to me after.The Assassination of Harold Lane^72^All^Borean Tundra^Arch Druid Lathorius^Arch Druid Lathorius^^Ears of Our Enemies, The Culler Cometh, The Nefarious Clam Master..., Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer, Ned, Lord of Rhinos...^^Arch Druid Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Outpost in the Borean Tundra wants you to kill Harold Lane.^You have done much for the animals of the Borean Tundra, <name>. Nesingwary's lackeys have been beaten back and taught a lesson that they will not soon forget. Harold Lane, the primary agent responsible for the mass slaughters in Nagrand, has been identified as the man in charge of Nesingwary operations in the tundra. He is stationed at Lake Kum'uya, west of here. <Lathorius hands you an intricately carved oak horn.> Find Lane and kill him. Use this horn should you require our aid.The Power of the Elements^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Dorain Frosthoof^Dorain Frosthoof^^Load'er Up!^Patching Up^Dorain Frosthoof at Taunka'le Village wants you to use the Windsoul Totem to gather the energy of 10 Steam Ragers.^I kept trying to tell that silly goblin his machines are unreliable. But the power of the elements; that is deep and abiding. When my apprenticeship is over, I will wield their full power. What I know now should be sufficient to help out our friend Fezzix, though. Take this windsoul totem and plant it near any of the steam ragers to the west of the village. The totem will gather up the energies of slain elementals. Return the fully charged totem to me and I'll do the rest.Patching Up^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Fezzix Geartwist^Fezzix Geartwist^^The Power of the Elements^Shrouds of the Scourge^Fezzix Geartwist at Taunka'le Village wants you to bring him 5 Steam Cured Hides.^Remember all that gnomish duct tape you brought me? Well, I've found a use for it. The body of this flying machine is so banged up in places, that I'm going to need to reinforce it if I ever hope to fly. Dorain over there has been telling me that the taunka use steam cured caribou leather for making watertight containers. Marsh caribou live all around the village and in the Flood Plains to the south. Get the best hides you can find and cure them over the steam vents in the Geyser Fields.Master the Storm^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Earth and Sky^Sage Earth and Sky^Ride to Taunka'le Village^^^Defeat the Storm Tempest and then return to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.^From what you describe, the creatures of metal should be easy to deal with. But first, you must master the storm. Behind me in the lodge is a totem. When you are ready, focus your will upon it and the storm will come. You must defeat the storm and in so doing take its essence into yourself. If others are there, it is enough that you all work together to defeat it. Return to me after, <class>.Weakness to Lightning^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Earth and Sky^Sage Earth and Sky^Ride to Taunka'le Village^^^While weakened by the Power of the Storm, destroy any 15 of the robotic units, except the mechagnomes, in the greater pools area surrounding the Fizzcrank Pumping Station.^You now have the power of the storm within you. I will give you the means to focus that power and weaken the robots in the pools. Take this lightning rod. Use it against the robotic creations of the mechagnomes you find within the greater pools area to the west. Do not worry about using it against the mechagnomes themselves; Greatmother Taiga has other plans for them. Once the robots are weakened by the power of the storm, dismantle them utterly!Plug the Sinkholes^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Sergeant Hammerhill^Sergeant Hammerhill^A Time for Heroes^^Nick of Time, Distress Call, Word on the Street, Farshire^Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to use the Incendiary Explosives to collapse the sinkholes southwest and northwest of Valiance Keep.^The Scourge are showing no sign of letting up, <name>. It's those blasted sinkholes; they connect to tunnels all the way to Icecrown for all we know. Giant undead worms burrow under the ground to create them. If there's something years of mining has taught me it's that without support beams, tunnels will cave in easily after an explosion. Take these explosives and place them at the entrance to the sinkholes up on the ridge beyond the beach to the west. Come back after you've collapsed them.Breaking Through^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Chieftain Wintergale^Chieftain Wintergale^^Words of Power^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^Defeat Prince Valanar and his lieutenants, Vanthryn the Merciless and Luthion the Vile, then report to Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.^On the lowest tier of the Temple City, there is a gray altar bathed in light. Step into it to gain entry to the dread necropolis Naxxanar. Be cautious, <name>. Prince Valanar will certainly be defended by his personal retainers, who will give their lives to keep you from ascending to the top level of the necropolis. You must find your way through the necropolis to the prince's seat. If you fail to defeat him, <name>, I fear my people will never know the safety Icemist offers.Souls of the Decursed^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Greatmother Taiga^Greatmother Taiga^^^Defeat the Gearmaster^Use The Greatmother's Soulcatcher to capture the souls of 10 Fizzcrank mechagnomes. Then, return to Greatmother Taiga at Taunka'le Village once you have done so.^The mechagnomes in the pools to the west are a great mystery to us. They appeared not long after the gnomes disappeared from their pumping station and its environs. They are an unnatural danger and must be dealt with. Take this soulcatcher and use it on the remains of the mechagnomes to capture their souls. When you return, we will set them free so that we might find out what happened.Reading the Meters^71^All^Borean Tundra^Archmage Berinand^Archmage Berinand^Reading the Meters^^^Archmage Berinand at the Transitus Shield has asked you to collect the readings from his instruments in Coldarra.^I had hoped that the Nexus' impact was limited to this region. Recently though, reports have flooded in from all over Azeroth suggesting that geologic instability is growing exponentially! I need the Nexus monitored regularly as I work to develop a solution. I've placed sensitive instruments around Coldarra, disguised as Malygos' scrying orbs. One lies in the trench near the Nexus, and three are hidden in the structures around the valley's perimeter. Visit each and return to me with their readings.Military? What Military?^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Gerald Green^Plagued Grain^Farshire^^Reference Material^Gerald Green in Farshire wants you to go into the mine to the north and find out what happened to the military detachment that was sent there.^There's Scourge everywhere, <class>. We've organized the farmers and miners into a militia, but this just won't cut it. The one detachment of troops that Valiance Keep sent is defending the mine. We haven't heard from them in days! If you really wish to help us, why don't you go to the mine and see what's going on? Maybe we can get them to send us some reinforcements.Pernicious Evidence^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Plagued Grain^Gerald Green^Farshire^^Take No Chances^Return to Gerald Green in Farshire.^The sacks of grain emanate the foul stench you've come to associate with the Plague. This probably explains what happened to the footmen defending the mine. You'd best bring word back to Gerald Green.It's Time for Action^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Gerald Green^Gerald Green^Farshire^^^Gerald Green in Farshire wants you to kill 14 Plagued Scavengers.^Well, <name>. With the last of our military in Farshire dead or worse, we can do but one thing: fight these Scourge ourselves. We have deployed militia in what remains of Farshire. Without your help, they've but little hope of winning. Go and lend them a hand. Me and the lads will watch this path. We can't let the Scourge break through!Fruits of Our Labor^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Gerald Green^Gerald Green^Farshire^^^Go to the mine in Farshire, obtain the Cart Release Key from Captain Jacobs and use it to release the ore cart. Return to Gerald Green in Farshire when you've completed this task.^The Scourge just keeps coming... but we can't give up! Listen, <name>. Inside that mine there's a cart with the last of the ore the Alliance is going to see on this side of the continent for a long time. The problem is the cart release is locked. When the military went in there, Captain Jacobs commandeered all the important equipment, including the cart release key. The plague that affected the soldiers in the mine must also have affected Jacobs. Get the key from him and salvage the ore.Postponing the Inevitable^71^All^Borean Tundra^Archmage Berinand^Archmage Berinand^Reading the Meters^^^Archmage Berinand in the Transitus Shield wants you to use the Interdimensional Refabricator near the rift in the Nexus.^I've determined the cause of the instability! Azeroth's ley lines are being redirected to the Nexus. It's fascinating! If only I could spend the remainder of my days studying this anomaly.... Sadly, I must focus on the immediate crisis. The influx of arcane energies is tearing a rift between dimensions. Deep inside the Nexus, the fabric of our universe is being weakened. I cannot stop it, but I've discovered a way to slow it down. Take this into the Nexus and activate it near the forming rift.Cleaning Up the Pools^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Iron Eyes^Iron Eyes^^^^Collect 15 Fizzcrank Spare Parts and deliver them to Iron Eyes at Taunka'le Village.^<A single tear rolls down the face of Iron Eyes.> I have heard that you are heading back into the pools to the west. I have something for you to do while you are out there, <race>. The gnomes, who care nothing for the land, have polluted it with their machinery. I want you to pick up any spare parts that you come across. Return them to me here. I will see to it that they are properly disposed of before we leave this place for good.The Sub-Chieftains^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sage Earth and Sky^Sage Earth and Sky^Ride to Taunka'le Village^^^Defeat Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder, and then report back to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.^It is known that Gearmaster Mechazod has four sub-chieftains that manage the robots in the pools. We must put an end to them! Our longrunners and snow trackers say that if you were to turn the valves at the west point, north point, mid point and south point stations, each of his sub-chieftains would come quickly to prevent you from fouling their operations. The stations are centered on the spinning lights in the pools surrounding the pumping station. Hurry, <name>!Reference Material^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Jeremiah Hawning^Jeremiah Hawning^Reference Material^Military? What Military?^^Jeremiah Hawning wants you to retrieve the book "Fields, Factories and Workshops" from the burning building next to the mine in Farshire.^I was in charge of the harvest golems - an important job until the Scourge destroyed most of our farmlands. I've an idea that would make the golems useful again, however. I think I can rewire the harvest collectors so they'll give us a hand fighting the Scourge. I'm not an expert at this just yet, so I'm going to need my manual. The problem is, I left it at the workshop... which happens to be that burning building next to the mine. Think you could go salvage it?Defeat the Gearmaster^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Greatmother Taiga^Greatmother Taiga^^Souls of the Decursed^^Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to Greatmother Taiga at Taunka'le Village.^Clearly this Gearmaster Mechazod creature is not in his right mind. If his offer of a cure and immortality means all of us becoming robotic slaves then he must be stopped! The winds that guide me whisper that he's atop the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the west. Most likely, he'll be found in the command hut on top of the structure. Go inside and research his works. <name>, you must confront Mechazod if we are to survive!Secrets of the Ancients^71^All^Borean Tundra^Archmage Berinand^Archmage Berinand^Secrets of the Ancients^^^Archmage Berinand in the Transitus Shield wants you to collect 3 Glacial Splinters and 3 Magic-Bound Splinters from the Ancients in Coldarra.^It's become clear that the instability in the region has had an effect on its indigenous creatures. I've taken a particular interest in the Glacial Ancients and their recent adaptations. I suspect that their transformation into these 'Magic-bound' Ancients may hold clues to our predicament here. For my studies, I'll need samples from both. Do hurry....Quickening^71^All^Borean Tundra^Archmage Berinand^Archmage Berinand^Secrets of the Ancients^^^Archmage Berinand in the Transitus Shield wants you to enter the Nexus and collect 5 Arcane Splinters from Crystalline Protectors.^Though we may be witnessing the end of our existence, I can't help but marvel. I've learned more in my short time here than in decades of studies. These Ancients are being exposed to incredible levels of arcane energy. It's literally transforming them into something... different. I'm confident that there's another stage in their metamorphosis. I'll need you to actually enter the Nexus, <name>, and find me some evidence of their final state. Do be careful....Nuts for Berries^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Serrah^Librarian Serrah^Nuts for Berries^^^Librarian Serrah in the Transitus Shield wants you to gather 10 Frostberries from the Frostberry Bushes in Coldarra.^Oh! What a relief it is to see a fresh face. I was beginning to feel we had been forsaken. Our supply lines were cut off days ago, and things have been looking - well, bleak. To be honest, this was a suicide mission to begin with if you ask me. Maybe I'm simply not cut out for all of this violence - to say nothing of the bitter cold! I'd much rather be back in Dalaran studying ancient texts. To the point, our food supply is nearly spent. Please, gather what you can and bring it to me.Take No Chances^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Wendy Darren^Wendy Darren^^Pernicious Evidence^^Wendy Darren wants you to use Wendy's Torch to burn 8 sacks of Farshire Grain.^I heard what you told Gerald and I don't like it one bit. If cultists managed to poison the grain in the mines with their foul plague, they could've easily done the same with the grain outside. We don't have time to sort the good grain from the bad. We must act quickly and burn it all. Take this torch and set fire to any sacks of grain you find out here. It would be a tragedy if we survived this attack only to succumb to the plague afterwards.Keep the Secret Safe^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Serrah^Librarian Serrah^Nuts for Berries^^^Librarian Serrah in the Transitus Shield needs you to kill Arcane Serpents near the Nexus and collect 5 Nexus Mana Essences from them.^Our existence here depends entirely upon staying hidden. Should the shield fail, even for a moment, Malygos' minions would have us. One of my responsibilities is to rejuvenate the warmages' mana levels so their focus doesn't falter. With our supply lines lost, I've been forced to improvise. I could use your help, <name>. Very near the Nexus, Arcane Serpents feast on the abundant magical energies. Once defeated, they will yield a mana essence that I can make use of.Hellscream's Champion^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Garrosh Hellscream^Chieftain Wintergale^^^Message from the West^Seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le Village.^You have faced all challenges that have been set before you and squashed them beneath your boot heel. It is because of you, <name>, that the Horde is now firmly entrenched in Northrend. But our work has only just begun. We must march to Icecrown and we must tear down its walls! Your next assignment begins to the east, at Taunka'le Village. Our taunka allies are in dire straits and require aid. Secure transport from the stable master, Durkot Wolfbrother, and seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le.Basic Training^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Basic Training^^^Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to slay 10 Coldarra Spellweavers.^This is war, mortal, and we are the tip of the spear. Your little spats over land or currency pale in comparison to this conflict. We face the aspect Malygos and his entire blue dragonflight. All you need to know is that if he is victorious, this world shall be no more. We are but few here, and we fly against many. Our deaths are all but a certainty, and our ultimate success lies in merely delaying our enemy. Go now. Busy yourself while I decide what to do with you.Drake Hunt^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Basic Training^^Drake Hunt^Raelorasz wants you to use Raelorasz's Spear to subdue a Nexus Drake Hatchling and return it to him at the Transitus Shield.^The blues have begun to cover their drakes in mysterious runes. I must discover their significance. <Raelorasz pokes his hand with a spear and coats the tip with his blood.> Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires. Their hatchlings feed around the northwest edge of the valley.Cultists Among Us^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Cultist Shrine^Captain "Lefty" Lugsail^^^Notify Arlos^Speak to Captain "Lefty" Lugsail above the Stormbreaker in Valiance Keep.^This altar bears all the markings of the Cult of the Damned. It appears fanatics from the mainland have made it into Northrend. It might be prudent to notify the captain of the ship. Perhaps he is to be found above deck.Word on the Street^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Mark Hanes^Leryssa^Word on the Street^Plug the Sinkholes^^Find Leryssa at the inn in Valiance Keep^Hey, <name>. There's a girl in the inn that's asking about you. Her name's Leryssa. I don't think she knows you, but she said she needed your help. She sounded really desperate.Farshire^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Sergeant Hammerhill^Gerald Green^Farshire^Plug the Sinkholes^^Travel to Farshire in Borean Tundra and speak to Gerald Green.^My lads should be able to take it from here, <name>. Valiance Keep is built to take a beating far worse than this. I worry about our farmlands and mine in Farshire, however. We sent a full detachment to protect our mining operations right before the invasion - they should be able to defend the civilians. Gerald Green's in charge of the villagers there. There's a passage out of the northern wall out of Valiance Keep; it'll take you straight to him. See what you can do to help them.The Fall of Taunka'le Village^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Chieftain Wintergale^Mother Tauranook^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^Breaking Through^^Speak to Mother Tauranook outside the gates of Taunka'le Village.^We are lost, <name>. This place has been our home for many generations, but it is no longer safe. There remains only death... Death and a memory of what used to be. I have called for the evacuation of Taunka'le. All remaining taunka must leave at once and make their way to our capital city, Icemist, located in the Dragonblight. <Wintergale points east.> You must help get my people to safety, <name>. Mother Tauranook awaits you at the village gates. Hurry! The Scourge closes in from all sides!Across Transborea^72^Horde^Borean Tundra^Mother Tauranook^Wartook Iceborn^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^^^Escort the Taunka'le Evacuees across Transborea to Wartook Iceborn on the border of the Dragonblight.^The path across Transborea, to the east, is the only way to reach the Dragonblight. Many perils await you as you make your journey across the tundra. Beware the Scourge and its influence upon the beasts of the land. Rumors have started to spread about our very own taunka brothers and sisters rising from the dead and attacking caravans on their way to the Dragonblight! Defend your caravan and get the evacuees to safety! Wartook Iceborn waits for you across the bridge leading into the Dragonblight.Cracking the Code^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Basic Training^^^Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to get the Azure Codex from Inquisitor Caleras and collect 3 Shimmering Runes from his Coldarra Spellbinders.^I sense a distinct peculiarity in the drakes here but the meaning of the runes that cover their bodies still eludes me. Without a codex, it will take more time than we can afford for me to interpret them. Not far from here is a Kirin Tor traitor, Caleras, who is likely to have a copy of the tome I require. His underlings hold the runes I will need for my translation. Hurry, mortal. Malygos gains strength with every passing moment.Cowards and Fools^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Private Brau^Ataika^Word on the Street^^^Speak to Ataika in Kaskala, northeast of Valiance Keep.^Listen, <name>. No offense, but the operation they put Thassarian in charge of was pure suicide. A handful of our men were to launch an attack on the biggest Scourge presence in the area. Call me crazy, but storming a Scourge ziggurat outside a plagued Nerubian city with a dozen men ain't my idea of fun. If you're still interested in finding Thassarian, we were supposed to arrange for passage east with a tuskarr by the name of Ataika in Kaskala to the northeast. Good luck with your fool's errand.Hatching a Plan^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Basic Training^^^Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to kill Coldarra Wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break 5 blue dragon eggs.^Our goals here are simple. We are to remain hidden from Malygos, observe his brood, and thwart his efforts wherever possible. To that end, I have a task for you. The blues are laying their eggs at the base of the Nexus. Exposure to so much arcane energy will surely make them hatch sooner, and there's no telling what effect it will have on their spawn. I don't intend to find out. Slay the local wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break the eggs.Buying Some Time^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Thassarian^Thassarian^Finding the Phylactery^^^Thassarian at the Wailing Ziggurat in Borean Tundra wants you to inflict 20 casualties against the Scourge inside the Temple City of En'kilah. Use Lurid's Bones if you need assistance.^Now that we have this phylactery, I shouldn't have any problems getting the information I need. It won't take long for the Scourge in the Temple City to notice something's up, however. I won't be able to fend off a full scale attack here. Or maybe I would... but I'd rather not find out. I want you to head down there and inflict some casualties. Hopefully they'll be distracted long enough for these two to spill their guts... figuratively, of course. Take Lurid with you, he might be of aid.Drake Hunt^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^^Drake Hunt^^Raelorasz wants you to use the Blood-tipped Spear to subdue a Nexus Drake Hatchling and return it to him at the Transitus Shield.^I need more drake hatchlings to continue researching the runes covering their bodies. They can be found around the northwest edge of the valley.... <Raelorasz pokes his hand with a spear and coats the tip with his blood.> Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires.Puzzling...^71^All^Borean Tundra^Scintillating Fragment^Raelorasz^Puzzling...^^^Bring the Scintillating Fragment to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield.^Something about this scrap of metal prevents you from casting it aside. Perhaps Raelorasz might be able to shed some light on its purpose.Words of Power^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Thassarian^Thassarian^Finding the Phylactery^^^Thassarian at the Wailing Ziggurat wants you to go to the Temple City of En'kilah and retrieve High Priest Talet-Kha's Scroll from the Spire of Pain, High Priest Naferset's Scroll from the Spire of Decay and High Priest Andorath's Scroll at the Spire of Blood.^The lich has spoken, <name>. The high priests of En'kilah hold the secret to entering Naxxanar. Go to the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain and the Spire of Decay and slay each of the priests. Return once you've obtained the three scrolls.The Cell^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Puzzling...^^Keristrasza^Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to obtain the Prison Casing from General Cerulean and the Energy Core from Warbringer Goredrak.^You've discovered a fragment of a special prison, <name>. Malygos' minions use similar prisons to hold their captured mages and other arcane entities, but this prison was constructed to hold something... stronger. In hopes that the enemy of our enemy will prove to be a friend, you must search for the prison's remaining fragments. They are likely to be in the possession of Malygos' most trusted underlings.Surrounded!^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Corporal Venn^Corporal Venn^Word on the Street^^^Corporal Venn at Death's Stand wants you to slay 7 Ziggurat Defenders.^Our situation is nearly hopeless. We were ordered to take the Wailing Ziggurat with a handful of men. We'll be lucky if we can hold this position against the Scourge. We're outnumbered, injured and have no escape route. If you can take some of the pressure off of us, we might be able to solidify our position. Kill some of the undead circling the structure - we'll hold off their advance.Preparing for the Worst^72^All^Borean Tundra^Utaik^Utaik^^^^Utaik wants you to gather 8 Kaskala Supplies in Kaskala.^Dark times are upon us. Karkut's spirit walks the earth and gathers the spirits of dead tuskarr. The sons of the mist have taken many of our brethren. Soon dear Kaskala will be reduced to ashes. There is hope yet. Not for us perhaps, but we've sent our families to Unu'pe. We fight here so there may be a future for them. They will need supplies or they will starve. There's not enough food in Unu'pe. Salvage any supplies before it's too late for our families.Keristrasza^71^All^Borean Tundra^Keristrasza^Keristrasza^Keristrasza^The Cell^^Keristrasza wants you to speak to her when you are ready to prepare for a confrontation with Malygos.^I am... free? I was destined to spend an eternity roaming an empty abyss, and now am saved? You cannot fathom my gratitude, mortal. When I refused to bend to his will Malygos bound me to that prison, then shattered it and scattered the pieces. Should I live one hundred of your lifetimes, I shall not forget this kindness. Perhaps, in time, I will find ways to repay you. For now, though, we must focus our attention on Malygos. I am weak, and there is much to be done. I need your help, <name>.Not Without a Fight!^72^All^Borean Tundra^Ataika^Ataika^Not Without a Fight!^^^Ataika wants you to slay 12 Kvaldir Raiders in Kaskala.^Kaskala is a sacred place for us, <race>. Our ancestors were guided here by the spirit of Tayutka herself. Now these foul creatures attack us from the mists without any provocation. We will show them that our spears are not merely for whaling. Fight alongside us, friend. Perhaps my people might repay you some time in the future.Muahit's Wisdom^72^All^Borean Tundra^Ataika^Elder Muahit^Not Without a Fight!^^^Find Elder Muahit in Kaskala.^Listen, <name>. Warriors like me are replaceable. If I fall, my brothers and cousins will pick up my spear and fight. My people cannot survive without wise elders. Stubborn Muahit, our most venerable shaman, refuses to leave the altar to Tayutka in the central island. We would suffer a significant loss if he was slain by these monsters. You are an outsider, maybe he'll listen to you. Show him reason... ask him to flee to the safety of Unu'pe before it's too late.Bait and Switch^71^All^Borean Tundra^Keristrasza^Keristrasza^Keristrasza^^^Keristrasza has asked you to collect 10 Crystalized Mana Shards from around Coldarra.^During my captivity I was able to learn much about Malygos. Fate now allows us to use this knowledge against him. There is a great blue dragon, Saragosa, who circles high above the Nexus. She serves both as the aspect's guardian and as his consort. If any serious threats arise, she alerts her master of the danger. I suffered greatly at the hand of Saragosa during my captivity, and now her time to die has come. First, however, we must fashion the perfect bait....Finding the Phylactery^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Thassarian^Thassarian^Finding the Phylactery^^^Go to Death's Stand and ride Dusk to the location of Tanathal's Phylactery. Obtain it and bring it back to Thassarian inside the Wailing Ziggurat.^No time for small talk, <name>. I was sent on what was to be a suicide mission to take this ziggurat. I've accomplished my duty as a soldier, now is the time to get some answers. This lich has knowledge I seek, yet I cannot inflict pain to his physical body to obtain that knowledge. The lich stored his soul in a phylactery, and while it remains hidden, I won't be able to pry the information from him. Return to the camp and take my horse, Dusk, she will lead you to the phylactery. Bring it to me.Saragosa's End^71^All^Borean Tundra^Keristrasza^Keristrasza^Keristrasza^^^Keristrasza wants you to use the Power Focus to lure Saragosa, and then defeat her.^Using the mana crystals you provided, I have created this Power Focus. Saragosa is a glutton. She will be unable to resist its lure. Inside it lie magics that will greatly diminish her power. Let us hope she does not see through my ruse.... Prepare yourself, <name>, and speak to me again when you are ready to face Saragosa.Let Nothing Go To Waste^72^All^Dragonblight^Elder Ko'nani^Elder Ko'nani^Let Nothing Go To Waste^^^Retrieve 6 Stolen Moa'ki Goods from the wolvar. Return them to Elder Ko'nani at Moa'ki Harbor.^The wolvar have always been our natural enemies. But the incursion of your peoples into the Great Dragonblight has forced them into a small space upon the glade to the north. Combined with the land's upheaval this morning, they have become even more aggressive than ever before. They have made several raids upon our goods... things that we'll need if we are to survive the trek from our home here. As a sign of good faith and friendship, retrieve our goods from the Snowfall Glade wolvar.Slay Loguhn^73^All^Dragonblight^Elder Ko'nani^Elder Ko'nani^Let Nothing Go To Waste^^Tua'kea's Crab Traps, Signs of Big Watery Trouble, Spiritual Insight^Smear the Blood of Loguhn upon yourself and then return to Elder Ko'nani at Moa'ki Harbor.^Already it goes from bad to worse. There is only one course to take... regrettably, Loguhn must die! He's the alpha male of the Snowfall Glade tribe and one mean wolvar. But it's the only way to get a short break from their attacks and stealing forays. You will find the "Render of Flesh" in front of his hovel upon the northern rise of the glade. It's larger than the others and hard to miss. Kill him and smear his blood upon yourself, both to show your dominance and respect.Planning for the Future^72^All^Dragonblight^Trapper Mau'i^Trapper Mau'i^^^^Collect 12 Snowfall Glade Pups. Deliver them to Trapper Mau'i at Moa'ki Harbor.^We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain. The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance. If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them. While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me.Spirits Watch Over Us^72^All^Borean Tundra^Elder Muahit^Elder Muahit^Not Without a Fight!^^^Elder Muahit at Njord's Breath Bay wants you to find Iruk's corpse in the water and retrieve Issliruk's totem.^Powerful spirits watch over my tribe -- Kaskala will not be lost. Issliruk will give us courage, Tayutka will make sure our survivors always have food and shelter and Karkut will watch over the fallen so they do not lose their way. Issliruk's guidance is the one we need the most right now. I asked my nephew, Iruk, to bring me Issliruk's totem, but the Kvaldir's spears struck him down and his body fell into the waters to the north. Bring me the totem, <name>. Don't let my nephew's death be in vain.One Last Delivery^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Gerald Green^Hilda Stoneforge^Farshire^^^Deliver the Crate of Farshire Ore to Hilda Stoneforge in Valiance Keep.^That's it then. With the last of the ore you salvaged we now have enough to send to Valiance Keep. If Farshire is wiped off the face of Azeroth, then at least let us be remembered as the first ones to defend our land and the last ones to give up. Take this ore to Hilda Stoneforge - she is a good friend of mine. Tell her to make some good weapons with this ore. We'll need plenty of them in the days to come.Weapons for Farshire^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Hilda Stoneforge^Gerald Green^Farshire^^^Return to Gerald Green in Farshire.^Farshire is overrun and all that Gerald can think of is to get me my ore shipment? I swear that man has as much heart as any of our soldiers on the frontlines. We cannot let the civilians lose their lands if they're willing to fight for them. We might not have the troops to spare, but we can send them weapons. These were earmarked for new recruits, but I'll be able to cover those with the ore you've brought me. Send word to Gerald that weapons are on the way.Call to Arms!^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Gerald Green^Gerald Green^Farshire^^^Go to the town hall building in Farshire and ring the bell inside of it.^Farshire has a fighting chance now, <name>. That's all we could've asked for and you've made it possible. All we need now is a rallying point. I'll have my men deliver the weapons to our town hall. Go and ring the town hall bell so any survivors know to rally there. It's time to show the Scourge what we're made of.Mustering the Reds^71^All^Borean Tundra^Keristrasza^Raelorasz^Keristrasza^^^Keristrasza has asked you to bring her to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield.^Malygos is certainly aware that something is amiss. I know him. His focus is fragmented. I am confident that I can lure him from the safety of his realm when he learns what has become of his precious Saragosa. Take me to Raelorasz at once, <name>. He must rouse every dragon he commands to face Malygos.The Tides Turn^71^All^Borean Tundra^Elder Muahit^Elder Muahit^Not Without a Fight!^^Travel to Moa'ki Harbor^Elder Muahit wants you to kill Heigarr the Horrible in Njord's Breath Bay.^The spirits have heard our cry for help, <name>. It's a sign that Kaskala might yet be saved. Take advantage of the confusion the weather has created and slay the Kvaldir leader. Your actions will sway the battle in our favor, I am sure of it.Springing the Trap^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Keristrasza^^^Raelorasz wants you to use Raelorasz' Spark at the signal fire in Coldarra.^We owe this opportunity in great part to your efforts, <name>. It is only fitting that you initiate the attack on Malygos. Take this spark and use it to light the signal fire northwest of the Nexus. Keristrasza will direct you from there.Prisoner of War^71^All^Borean Tundra^Raelorasz^Raelorasz^Keristrasza^^^Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield wants you to enter the Nexus and release Keristrasza.^Malygos has taken Keristrasza to serve as his consort!? Unthinkable! She'll never cooperate willingly, but Malygos is a powerful aspect, and will eventually bend her will. This cannot come to pass, <name>. I refuse to allow her to suffer this indignity. You must enter the Nexus and do whatever is required to spare her this fate.A Tauren Among Taunka^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Wartook Iceborn^Emissary Brighthoof^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^^Into the Fold^Seek out Emissary Brighthoof at the Westwind Refugee Camp.^<Wartook points northeast.> She is quite kind, you know. If it were not for your emissary, the surviving refugees may have given up hope. While she may not be taunka by birthright, the tribe has taken to her as a village elder for the time being. If you are who I think you are, please go and pay Emissary Brighthoof a visit inside the refugee camp. She has been waiting for you.Into the Fold^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Emissary Brighthoof^Emissary Brighthoof^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^^^Emissary Brighthoof at the Westwind Refugee Camp in the Dragonblight wants you to recover 10 Horde Armaments.^Before we can officially bring these taunka into the Horde we must recover our armaments from the Anub'ar Nerubians that infest the nearby woods. The armaments were lost when a caravan from Agmar's Hammer was ambushed by the Scourge late last night. Venture out into the woods to the east of Westwind Refugee Camp and recover those armaments, <race>.The Taunka and the Tauren^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Emissary Brighthoof^The Taunka and the Tauren^^Into the Fold^Seek out Emissary Brighthoof at the Westwind Refugee Camp.^The Scourge have seized control of the capital city of the taunka, Icemist Village! All living taunka that escaped the massacre are being held in protective custody at the Westwind Refugee Camp on the western border of Dragonblight. Lord Hellscream believes that the taunka must join the Horde if they are to survive and has sent a tauren emissary to Westwind to bolster our relationship with the winter tauren. Travel to Westwind Refugee Camp and seek out Emissary Brighthoof. You will assist her.Pride of the Horde^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Blood Guard Roh'kill^Blood Guard Roh'kill^^^^Blood Guard Roh'kill at the Westwind Refugee Camp in the Dragonblight wants you to slay 15 Anub'ar Ambushers.^I was one of the guards chosen to escort the caravan carrying the armament shipment to this camp. The attack came fast and without warning. We fought and killed dozens of the beasts, but in the end there were simply too many. Tor'zin and I barely made it out alive... If not for our injuries we would be out in the woods hunting down those fiends ourselves. Will you help us regain our lost pride? Search the woods east of here for Anub'ar Nerubians and kill them! For the Horde!Find Kurun!^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Fallen Earthen Warrior^Kurun^Find Kurun!^^Raining Down Destruction^Speak with Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan.^The Earthen warrior's stone surface is covered with cracks and gouges. Although it is incapable of bleeding, you can sense that the warrior is near death. A low, hoarse voice escapes from the dying warrior's mouth. "Find... Kurun... you must find... Kurun." It looks at you helplessly as you ask for any clues as to who or what Kurun might be. "Our... leader... he stands on the... hill overlooking Thor Modan... commands us. Please... tell him... we cannot take... the city... "Raining Down Destruction^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kurun^Kurun^Find Kurun!^^^Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to disrupt the iron dwarves' work by throwing boulders into the exposed area of Thor Modan.^Beneath us is iron's ancient bastion, Thor Modan. Thousands of years ago, the stone giants tore the land asunder, collapsing part of the city and exposing much of the rest. Even now, the iron dwarves attempt to reclaim their old capital, but we will not permit it. My giants fill the trench with boulders and debris, hoping to seal it off and kill the servants of iron as they work. Take up the boulders you see near the trench to the northeast, and help us put an end to their efforts.Blood Oath of the Horde^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Emissary Brighthoof^Emissary Brighthoof^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^^^Speak to the taunka at Westwind Refugee Camp and make 5 of them pledge their allegiance to the Horde.^They are ready, <name>. These taunka will all willingly join the Horde and give all that they have to see the Scourge driven from this world. <Brighthoof hands you a scroll bearing the insignia of the Horde.> Within this scroll you will find the blood oath of the Horde. Tradition dictates that our new taunka brothers and sisters utter the sacred words herein. Take the scroll and swear the taunka into the Horde, commander. Return the scroll to me when you have completed your duty.Filling the Cages^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Samir^Samir^Good Troll Hunting^^^Samir at Granite Springs wants you to use the Bounty Hunter's Cage on a drakkari troll that's been stunned by Budd.^Ol Budd's seen better days. Ever since our stay in Ghostlands he's been useless to us. We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder. Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit. See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak' Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll.Into the Breach^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kurun^Kurun^Find Kurun!^^^Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to kill Iron Thane Argrum.^If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city. The tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance?The Damaged Journal^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Battered Journal^Torthen Deepdig^^^The Runic Keystone^Recover 8 Missing Journal Pages, combine them with the Incomplete Journal, and return the completed journal to Torthen Deepdig at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps. The author's handwriting seems vaguely familiar, but you're unable to place it until you discover an entry signed with the name of Brann Bronzebeard. The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Pages litter the battlefield, and it will be impossible to know what Brann discovered here until the book is whole again.The Runic Keystone^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Torthen Deepdig^Torthen Deepdig^^The Damaged Journal^The Runic Prophecies^Bring 5 Runic Keystone Fragments to Torthen Deepdig at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^Brann's journal mentions that he used a runic keystone to illuminate the important runes on the plate he discovered. Without the keystone, the plate's contents would be little better than gibberish. At the end of Brann's last entry, he describes the iron dwarf defenders seizing the keystone from him, shattering it, and dividing it among themselves. Before we can decipher the runed plate, we must hunt down the fragments. Any of the dwarves within Thor Modan or the buildings around it may carry fragments.Truce?^73^All^Grizzly Hills^Drakuru^Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^^Drakuru at Granite Springs wants you to use the Dull Carving Knife near his cage and then speak to him.^Watch yerself, mon. Drakuru shrunk more <race> heads than I can remember - and even if I could remember, I couldn't count that high. Lucky for you I be stuck in dis cage or I'd be addin' one more to da list. But things bein' what they are, mebbe we be puttin' our differences aside fer a time, eh? Drakuru know things, mon. Things that will aid you in your struggle here. <Drakuru cuts the palm of his hand on one of his tusks and extends it through the cage.> So, what you say, mon... truce?Vial of Visions^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Drakuru^Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^Scourgekabob^Drakuru at Granite Springs wants you to bring him an Imbued Vial, a Waterweed Frond, and 3 Haze Leaves.^First things first, mon. There be some preparatory work that need doin'. No tellin' how long dey gunna keep me here. Ya be needin' a powerful elixir so we can be keepin' in touch. Lucky for you, I know just the thing! And the ingredients all be close by. I need a vial from the pretty little troll over there, some waterweed from the lake just north of here, and a few haze leaves found around the camp here. Hurry now, mon, before dey be haulin' me away.Subject to Interpretation^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Drakuru^Image of Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^^Drakuru wants you to get 5 Frozen Mojo from the Drakkari Trolls at the Ruins of Drak'Zin and then use the elixir at Drakuru's Brazier there.^A legendary set of artifacts, lost for thousands of years, were created to make Drak'Tharon Keep impervious. Most think they be myth, but Drakuru knows better, mon! I nearly discovered where one be, but got captured while interpreting hieroglyphs. Ya gotta summon my soul back dere so I can finish readin' em! Use my elixir at da brazier on Drak'Zin Ruins, southwest of here. You'll hafta mix in da frozen mojo my bruddas be holdin'. I hate ta see my bruddas fall, but it be for the greater good.The Runic Prophecies^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Torthen Deepdig^Torthen Deepdig^^The Runic Keystone^The Captive Prospectors^Torthen Deepdig at the Westfall Brigade Encampment wants you to decipher the three Rune Plates.^We've no time to lose! Now that we've reassembled the runic keystone -- well, most of it -- we can decipher the contents of those very same runic plates Brann was working on before he fled. We have no way of knowing if he managed to read the contents of all three plates, but we'll have to assume he got enough information to determine his next destination. Stand before each of the plates and use the keystone to determine the contents of each. Brann may be counting on us!Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Emissary Skyhaven^Image of Archmage Modera^Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest^^^Speak with the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.^<class>, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Stars' Rest with all due haste! The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives. Stars' Rest is westward past the intersection of the road leading north out of the harbor. There is an archmage there named Modera. She will be expecting you.Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Hammer^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Envoy Ripfang^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Hammer^^^Speak with the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.^<class>, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Agmar's Hammer with all due haste! The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives. The Hammer is westward past the intersection of the road leading north out of the harbor. Archmage Aethas Sunreaver himself will be expecting you!Softening the Blow^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Captain Gryan Stoutmantle^Brugar Stoneshear^Softening the Blow^^^Bring Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment a cask of Howlin' Good Moonshine.^Our best bet for moving our forces quickly to Icecrown Glacier lies with the network of tunnels beneath the ancient iron dwarf city of Thor Modan. Brugar Stoneshear and his Explorers' League boys aren't going to be happy, but orders are orders. The news might go over better if you brought him a cask of that moonshine sold by that trapper, Hugh Glass, down at Redwood Trading Post, southeast of here along the tree line. Man's not right in the head, but you won't find better moonshine out here.Rifle the Bodies^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Ham^^^Find the Moonrest Gardens Plans and return them to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.^The Moonrest Gardens to the southwest were the final resting place of a group of Highborne elves. It was also a ley line nexus. The blue dragonflight used a magical device they call a surge needle to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will. I want more information and you are going to get it for me! After the land was destroyed at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters there. Go rifle their corpses for clues.Rifle the Bodies^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Image of Archmage Modera^Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest^^^Find the Moonrest Gardens Plans and return them to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.^The Moonrest Gardens to the southwest were the final resting place of a noble group of Highborne elves. It was also a powerful ley line nexus. The blue dragonflight used a magical device they call a surge needle to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will. I need more information and I hope that you will get it for me. After the upheaval at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters present. Go rifle their corpses for clues.Brothers in Battle^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Brugar Stoneshear^Brugar Stoneshear^Softening the Blow^^^Kill 10 Runic Battle Golems and return to Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^I hope Gryan knows I withdrew my men from Thor Modan when the battle began. There's no way we can excavate anything until that place settles down. You seem like a brave sort, though, and you have Stoutmantle's trust. Thor Modan is just to the northeast of us and the battle still rages between our Earthen brothers and the creations of those accursed iron dwarves. Help our brethren to even the odds and I'll start figuring out how we're going to accomplish this survey of Thor Modan.Uncovering the Tunnels^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Brugar Stoneshear^Brugar Stoneshear^Softening the Blow^^^Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment wants you to explore the North Building, the East Building, and the South Building of Thor Modan.^The first place we'll search for entrances to the Thor Modan tunnel system will be the outlying buildings. As I left the site with my men, it looked like the iron dwarf defenders were taking refuge inside the buildings. Be careful as you explore them. Any tunnel entrances are likely to be toward the back of the buildings. I'm not sure what Stoutmantle thinks we're going to find down there, but I doubt the iron dwarves will make the search easy.Prevent the Accord^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Image of Archmage Modera^Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest^^^Deliver Wind Trader Mu'fah's Remains and the Scales of Goramosh to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.^We need to kill two birds with one stone here, <class>. You're the stone. Our two birds are Wind Trader Mu'fah and Goramosh. They should be somewhere in the western half of the Moonrest Gardens. Most likely they're in the larger two-story building overlooking the pit. I require proof of their demise, if you would be so kind.Prevent the Accord^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Your Presence is Required at Agmar's Ham^^^Deliver Wind Trader Mu'fah's Remains and the Scales of Goramosh to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.^We need to kill two birds with one stone here, <class>. You're the stone. Our two birds are Wind Trader Mu'fah and Goramosh. They should be somewhere in the western half of the Moonrest Gardens. Most likely they're in the larger two-story building overlooking the pit. I require proof of their demise, if you would be so kind.Avenge this Atrocity!^72^All^Dragonblight^Ethenial Moonshadow^Ethenial Moonshadow^Avenge this Atrocity!^^^Kill any combination of 15 Dragonblight Mage Hunters, Moonrest Stalkers, Surge Needle Sorcerers, and Focus Wizards. After you have done that, return to Ethenial Moonshadow at Moonrest Gardens.^These so-called mage hunters came here and destroyed our resting place. Avenge us, or I will see to it that your base of operations is overrun with the spirits of the dead!Sacrifices Must be Made^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Image of Drakuru^Image of Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^^Drakuru wants you to bring the Eye of the Prophets to him at Drakuru's Brazier in Zeb'Halak.^I've got it, mon! To da north, on da Ziggurat at Zeb'Halak be a stone head with ruby eyes. One o' dem be da Eye of the Prophets! Bring it to the brazier there and drink my elixir. Again, ya be needing some mojo for my elixir to work - dis time from da warlord, Zim'bo. He be hidin' in one of da huts in Zeb'Halak. It be a shame to kill Zim'bo, mon, but he swore da blood oath to defend Drak'Tharon and he done failed. Now at least his mojo be helpin' us to reclaim Drak'Tharon.Agmar's Hammer^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Emissary Brighthoof^Overlord Agmar^The Fall of Taunka'le Village^^Victory Nears..., Black Blood of Yogg-Saron, Marked for Death: High Cultist Zangus, Containing the Rot, The Kor'kron Vanguard!^Travel to Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight and speak to Overlord Agmar.^Directly east of this refugee camp stands Agmar's Hammer - testament to the Hordes' power in the Dragonblight. While I have no doubt that our Horde brothers and sisters are already seeing the result of your efforts to bring the taunka into the Horde, I want you to deliver news of your success to Overlord Agmar in person. Go now, <name>! Race the winds! East to Agmar's Hammer!Tua'kea's Crab Traps^72^All^Dragonblight^Tua'kea^Tua'kea^^Slay Loguhn^^Collect 8 of Tua'kea's Crab Traps and return them to him at Moa'ki Harbor.^With all of the troubles, I've lost my assistants. I was wondering if maybe you could help me? I have many crab traps under the waves of the harbor. Will you retrieve them for me? I'm too old for that sort of thing and the waters can be very dangerous. Please, take this bladder. It will help you to breathe while you're down there.The Fate of Orlond^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Brugar Stoneshear^Surveyor Orlond^Softening the Blow^^^Locate Surveyor Orlond within Thor Modan.^When we began excavating the city, I sent Surveyor Orlond to check the stability of the tunnels in Thor Modan. I didn't see him escape when we withdrew at the beginning of the battle, and I worry he may still be trapped inside the city. If we're going to get an army through Thor Modan, we'll need the information he was collecting. Stoutmantle and his superiors would have my hide if the tunnels collapsed on one of their brigades!Signs of Big Watery Trouble^72^All^Dragonblight^Wrecked Crab Trap^Tua'kea^Signs of Big Watery Trouble^Slay Loguhn^^Inform Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor about the wrecked crab trap.^This crab trap appears to have been destroyed by something much larger than the nearby circling sharks. Perhaps Tua'kea, the fisherman at Moa'ki Harbor, should be told about this?End Arcanimus^73^All^Dragonblight^Ethenial Moonshadow^Ethenial Moonshadow^Avenge this Atrocity!^^^Destroy Arcanimus and then return to Ethenial Moonshadow at Moonrest Gardens.^There is one last thing that I would have you do, <name> the <race>. I would have you destroy Arcanimus! The sorcerers to the west used that giant device in the sky to bore a massive pit into our resting place. When they did that, they unleashed a monstrosity! I would not care if it were only a concern for mortals, but Arcanimus feeds upon the spirits of the dead. You will put an end to it now!Steady as a Rock?^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Surveyor Orlond^Brugar Stoneshear^Softening the Blow^^Check Up on Raegar^Retreive the Portable Seismograph and use it to take stability readings in Thor Modan, then return to Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^Orlond's notes indicate that he brought a piece of equipment called a portable seismograph with him, but the device is nowhere to be seen. The survey log shows that Orlond completed all his readings in the Thor Modan tunnel, save one labeled the 'east end of the exposed tunnel.' The last entry in the log indicates Orlond tried to take refuge in the water and was attacked by subterranean threshers. They might've taken his equipment.You'll need to recover it before you can take the last reading.The Bait^72^All^Dragonblight^Tua'kea^Tua'kea^Signs of Big Watery Trouble^^^Obtain The Flesh of "Two Huge Pincers" and deliver it to Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor.^I'm sure of it... our ancient aquatic nemesis, Tu'u'gwar, "He Who Plays With Food", has returned. We must lay a trap for him, you and I. If Tu'u'gwar has one weakness it's his stomach. There's one meat for certain that he'd never be able to pass up. "Two Huge Pincers", the mother of all crabs, Kili'ua, paces upon her island out in the waters to the southwest. You must pay her a visit and return with her meat.Meat on the Hook^73^All^Dragonblight^Tua'kea^Tua'kea^Signs of Big Watery Trouble^^^Slay Tu'u'gwar and then return to Tua'kea at Moa'ki Harbor.^The time has come my friend: Tu'u'gwar must be dealt with! I've prepped the meat so that the beast is sure to come once you bait the hook I have out in the water. Just follow the fishing line here down to it. Whatever you do, don't let Tu'u'gwar swallow you whole, <name>!Last Rites^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Thassarian^Thassarian^Finding the Phylactery^^^Go to the Temple City of En'kilah and find the teleportation orb beneath the floating Scourge citadel of Naxxanar. Use it to reach the top and help Thassarian there.^I served Arthas in death, because I had no choice. He had control over my will and my body. The Cult of the Damned serves Arthas in life... willingly. Now that we know the words of power to enter Naxxanar we can put an end to the cultist blight. Go to En'kilah and look for the teleportation orb beneath the floating citadel. Work your way up and meet me at the top. Arm yourself with what courage you can, we might not make it out of this alive.The Damaged Journal^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Battered Journal^Sage Paluna^The Damaged Journal^^^Recover 8 Missing Journal Pages, combine them with the Incomplete Journal, and return the completed journal to Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah.^This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps in the dwarven language. The only text you're able to decipher is the name of Brann Bronzebeard scrawled at the end of one of the entries. The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Someone thought the notes important enough to attempt to destroy them. Perhaps gathering the missing pages from the battlefield will yield some clues.Mr. Floppy's Perilous Adventure^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Emily^Squire Walter^^^^Help Emily and Mr. Floppy get back to the Westfall Brigade Encampment, then speak to Squire Walter.^Excuse me, <Mister/Ma'am>, do you know the way back to the soldiers' camp? Mr. Floppy and I decided to go for a walk in the woods, and my brother Walter was gonna come with us, but then he had squire things to do. So Mr. Floppy and I went by ourselves, but we got lost, and there were a whole bunch of hungry wolves, but we found this tower. The wolves went away, but we're still lost. I asked Mr. Floppy, and he doesn't know the way back. Would you help us? Please?Spiritual Insight^72^All^Dragonblight^Toalu'u the Mystic^Toalu'u the Mystic^Spiritual Insight^Slay Loguhn^^Speak with Toalu'u the Mystic at Moa'ki Harbor after you have attained your spiritual insight.^<race>, we have not heard from our people at Indu'le Village since the ground shook and was torn apart! Have you ever been upon a vision quest? You've bested Loguhn, so you must be capable. I will give you a special incense to sprinkle into my brazier. Breathe deep from its vapors and your spirit will be sent aloft to view what has transpired at Indu'le. As your spirit soars, I will be able to look through your eyes.Seared Scourge^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Mack Fearsen^Mack Fearsen^Seared Scourge^Scourgekabob^^Mack at Granite Springs wants you to use his grog to burn 20 Famished Scourge Trolls at Drak'Tharon.^... gotta burn these corpshes 'fore they shtart walkin' around again. Poppa always said, only thing worshe than havin' to kill a troll is havin' ta kill a troll twice. Say,... shpeakin' of Scourge, we can't get into tha' troll keep up north 'til we get them trolls thinned out a bit. How 'bout ya take shome o my grog here and put them bashtards outta their misery?Elder Mana'loa^72^All^Dragonblight^Toalu'u the Mystic^Elder Mana'loa^Spiritual Insight^^^Speak with the statue, Elder Mana'loa, at Indu'le Village.^My people.... <The mystic is on the verge of breaking down.> While your spirit was flying through the village, I sensed that Elder Mana'loa took notice of you. <name>, he wishes to speak with you. The stone elders are revered by us as fonts of ancient wisdom. The elder must want to help. Seek him in the northwest corner of the village.Freedom for the Lingering^72^All^Dragonblight^Elder Mana'loa^Elder Mana'loa^Spiritual Insight^^^Put to rest any combination of 15 Indu'le Fishermen, Mystics and Warriors, then return to Elder Mana'loa at Indu'le Village.^The sacred ground of the elves to the west has been torn asunder. Now their magic is moving through the land causing ruin where it flows. The souls of the Kalu'ak are in danger as the blue dragons forces attempt to control the magic. The power came up through the lake, instantly slaying most in the village. Those that survived were driven insane. <name>, you must release these spirits so that they may move on. Leave the deranged living alone; they may yet regain their sanity in time.Conversing With the Depths^72^All^Dragonblight^Elder Mana'loa^Toalu'u the Mystic^Spiritual Insight^^^Commune with The Pearl of the Depths and do as the sea-goddess Oacha'noa instructs.^The watery goddess, Oacha'noa, must be consulted; only she will know what the destiny of the Kalu'ak is to be. And only The Pearl of the Depths can call her forth from the murky nether. Off the coast to the southwest rises The Briny Pinnacle. Atop it sits the altar upon which the pearl rests. Commune at the altar and Oacha'noa is certain to hear your call. Do as she says lest you incur her wrath and bring ruin upon all of the tuskarr. Should you survive, return to the mystic.Message from the West^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Messenger Torvus^Messenger Torvus^^Hellscream's Champion^^Read the Letter from Saurfang and then destroy it.^<Torvus shakes your hand, giving you a letter in the process.> <Torvus speaks under his breath.> Just play along, <name>. It is good to see you here, soldier! Lord Hellscream has undoubtedly sent his strongest warriors to Lord Agmar! <Torvus speaks under his breath.> Read it and then destroy it in the fire pot next to me.Victory Nears...^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Overlord Agmar^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Victory Nears...^Agmar's Hammer^^Speak to Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer.^There remain only two primary threats that stand in our way. One is the dread citadel of Naxxramas, far to the east, above the Alliance fortress of Wintergarde and the other is the Pit of Narjun, exit point for the undead armies of Azjol'Nerub. It is from the Pit of Narjun that the Anub'ar Nerubians assaulted and ultimately razed the taunka village of Icemist. We will destroy the Anub'ar and close off the Pit of Narjun. Report to Senior Sergeant Juktok for your mission orders.Repurposed Technology^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Jeremiah Hawning^Jeremiah Hawning^Reference Material^^^Jeremiah Hawning at Farshire wants you to destroy 5 Harvest Collectors and then use Jeremiah's Tools to rewire them.^Ok, I've got it! The rewiring is a little complicated, but nothing a clever <class> like you can't handle. Take my tools and put some of the harvest collectors out of commission. Once they're down use the tools to plug all the red wires into the blue sockets. That'll make them go into self-defense mode. Hurry, <name>. Before long there won't be anything left to save.From the Depths of Azjol-Nerub^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Victory Nears...^^Strength of Icemist^Explore the Pit of Narjun and return with your findings to Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer.^The undead Nerubians that attacked Icemist Village came from a gigantic sinkhole known as the Pit of Narjun. If left alone, those fiends will no doubt flank our forces at the Wrathgate and end our march to victory. I need eyes on the ground, <name>. You are to head west and investigate the Pit of Narjun. We need to locate their primary exit point and seal it off! Find me that location.Search and Rescue^74^All^Drak'Tharon Keep^Mack Fearsen^Kurzel^Seared Scourge^^^Mack at Granite Springs wants you to go into Drak'Tharon and find out what became of Kurzel.^Orc women... they just don't lissen - hic. Know what I mean, <race>? Kurzel's been with us fer years. You'd think she'd get a feel fer how we do things by now. Lure the fools in fer the dangerous work, then reap the rewards when it's safe. What's so hard to understand? Not her though... impatient green-skin goes off and takes matters into her own hands. Probably dead by now, but I'd feel horrible if we didn't follow after her, and I'm in no shape to do it myself - hic. So whatdya say, pal?Seared Scourge^72^All^Grizzly Hills^Mack Fearsen^Mack Fearsen^^^^Mack at Granite Springs wants you to use his grog to burn 30 Famished Scourge Trolls.^Whatcha waitin' fer, <class>? Them shcourged trolls ain't gunna kill themselves! You know the drill. Git up ta Drak'Tharon up north... Take some o thish here grog and hurl it at 'em from a distance.... Then jusht sit back an' watch 'em burn.Black Blood of Yogg-Saron^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Borus Ironbender^Borus Ironbender^Black Blood of Yogg-Saron^Agmar's Hammer^^Borus Ironbender at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to recover 10 Black Blood of Yogg-Saron Samples.^Angrathar, the Wrathgate... I watched as the metal holding the gate together pulsed and undulated as if it were alive! In 50 years I've never seen metal "breathe." Only ones who knew anything about it were the tuskarr. They called it the "Black Blood of Yogg-Saron" and told me to keep my distance. There's a sinkhole outside Icemist Village to the west called the Pit of Narjun. I've heard of these sinkholes being rich with this strange ore. If you head that way, could you try and get me some samples?An Enemy in Arthas^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Kilix the Unraveler^Kilix the Unraveler^An Enemy in Arthas^^^Kilix the Unraveler at the Pit of Narjun in the Dragonblight has asked that you slay 6 Anub'ar Underlords.^We are in the midst of a civil war. At the heart of this world the last living members of my species defend themselves against total annihilation. The Lich King seeks to rule the kingdom of Azjol-Nerub at any cost. Those that do not acquiesce are branded enemies of the Scourge and marked for death. In Arthas we both have an enemy... Join our cause and rid this place of the taint of Anub'ar! Let Anub'arak himself hear the anguish of their death cries!The Lost Empire^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Kilix the Unraveler^Overlord Agmar^An Enemy in Arthas^^^Deliver Kilix's Battle Plan to Overlord Agmar at Agmar's Hammer to the east.^You have proven that you are willing to assist the Azjol Empire in its time of need and as such the Azjol Empire will assist the Horde. Take this scroll back to your leader. It documents the strengths and weaknesses of the Nerubians attacking Icemist Village. Consider it a gesture of good faith - a willingness to help your people. Use the knowledge on those pages to crush the Anub'ar and you will have done a service for us all. Farewell, <race>.Heart of the Ancients^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Image of Drakuru^Heart of the Ancients^Good Troll Hunting^^^Drakuru wants you to go to the uppermost chamber at Blue Sky Logging Ground and find the Heart of the Ancients.^Secrets of da ages, be revealed to me now! <Drakuru peers through the Eye of the Prophets.> Ahh, great be mah destiny, <name>. You be lucky ta know me.... There! I be seein' it, mon. The Heart of the Ancients. Dis be too easy! You gunna find da heart lyin' near da corpse of a goblin east of here. He be up in a chamber, near a river of broken trees. Hurry, mon, before someone else be findin' it!Nozzlerust Defense^74^All^Dragonblight^Narf^Narf^^^^Kill 12 Wastes Diggers and 1 Wastes Taskmaster at the digs surrounding Galakrond's Rest. Return to Narf at Nozzlerust Post when the task is complete.^You, <class>! These undead south of us are being a constant nuisance to our work. Go clear them out, will ya?Stocking Up^74^All^Dragonblight^Xink^Xink^Return to Sender^^^Gather 8 bundles of Composite Ore from the digs surrounding Galakrond's Rest and bring them to Xink at Nozzlerust Post.^Hello hello! The Scourge to the south are digging up some ancient dragon thing. I could care less why they're doing it, but they're pulling cartloads of composite ore in the process. Go lift me a bunch of that ore. That stuff should yield a pretty penny for all the weapons the Horde are crafting.Shaved Ice^74^All^Dragonblight^Zivlix^Zivlix^Shaved Ice^^^Collect 4 Ice Shard Clusters from Ice Elementals in the north and bring them to Zivlix at Nozzlerust Post.^I've never seen you before... are you new to the Vice? Glad to have you. I could always use some more hands. You get the materials, I'll finish my machine, then we can sell it to those commander types and all go home rich. I actually have most of the primary components, so I just need some of the materials for the weapon itself. Narf said that jagged ice shards from those elementals to the north would make perfect shrapnel for my bombs - go nab some, will ya?Soft Packaging^74^All^Dragonblight^Zivlix^Zivlix^Shaved Ice^^^Collect 12 Thin Animal Hides from the Jormungar Tunnelers or the Dragonbone Condors near Nozzlerust Post. Once you've located the hides, return them to Zivlix.^I need some new packaging for the shrapnel bombs. All the stuff I have is too hard and the shrapnel doesn't spread when it bursts. What we need is some really thin animal hide. Those jormungar tunnelers to the west might work... or perhaps the condors sifting through the dragon bones. Go get me whatever you can find.Something That Doesn't Melt^74^All^Dragonblight^Zivlix^Zivlix^Shaved Ice^^^Search the dragon bones east of Nozzlerust Post for 12 Splintered Bone Chunks.^No no no! Those ice shards didn't work at all! They'll melt before they even do any damage. That's the last time I'll trust Narf's word on materials. This means we need something else entirely for the shrapnel. I know! I'm brilliant. Bone splinters. There are some bones all around here that the jormungar have been gnawing on pretty thoroughly. Go check them out and see if you can find me some splintered bone that I can use.Scourge Armaments^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Borus Ironbender^Borus Ironbender^Black Blood of Yogg-Saron^^^Borus Ironbender at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to bring him 8 Scourge Armaments.^I can't make a damned thing out of this ore. It simply will not hold together! Despite my best efforts the Scourge metal will not bend! Perhaps if I had some samples of some forged Scourge armaments I might be able to reverse engineer the process by which the items are created. Icemist Village is crawling with armored Scourge Nerubians. Go there and get me some Scourge armaments! With your help I might actually succeed in creating something from this ore. You'll find Icemist to the west.Hard to Swallow^74^All^Dragonblight^Xink^Xink^^^^Battle a Hulking Jormungar east of Nozzlerust Post until it opens its mouth, then throw a Potent Explosive Charge into its throat. After it explodes, collect 6 slabs of Seared Jormungar Meat off of the ground and bring them back to Xink.^Those troops are sure to be needin' a hefty supply of food in their bellies. I'll let you in on a little secret that a squeamish <race> like you would never know... those jormungar worms taste just like chicken. Go provoke one of those giant hulking jormungar to the east. You're not likely to be able to kill one straight out, so just toss this down its throat when it opens its mouth wide. Bring me back as many of the slabs of meat as you can tote.Lumber Hack^74^All^Dragonblight^Xink^Xink^^^^Use Xink's Shredder Control Device to call a Shredder once you reach the Harpy Nesting Grounds in the North. Gather 50 Bundles of Lumber from the trees in the area, and then return to Xink at Nozzlerust Post.^Next up, we need to haul in some lumber for all the towers the Alliance are building. There are some thin trees to the south, but the trees the Harpies are nesting in to the north look much more fit for structures. Take this. When you get to the Harpy nesting area, use the control and one of my Shredders should come to you. Gather as much lumber as it can carry. The Harpies are sure to disagree with you chopping down their homes - just deal with them as necessary. Hop to it!Harp on This!^74^All^Dragonblight^Narf^Narf^^^^Kill the Mistress of the Coldwind and 15 Coldwind harpies in the mountains northwest of Nozzlerust Post. Return to Narf once the task is complete.^<class>, did you see that? That's the harpy that's been leading the attack on our shipments to the gate! I've seen her in the back of Coldwind Heights before.  Those harpies have slowed our profits long enough! Kill them all.The Might of the Horde^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Victory Nears...^^^Senior Sergeant Juktok at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Warsong Battle Standard at Icemist Village and defend it against attackers.^The taunka are now our brothers in arms. We must show our solidarity and retake Icemist Village. You will find Icemist Village west of Agmar's Hammer, sitting at the foot of the mountains. Travel there and challenge the Anub'ar Nerubians! Plant our beloved Horde banner at Icemist Village and destroy all that dare come to tear it down! Let the Anub'ar feel the true might of the Horde! Let our battle standard be the last thing that they see before death!Deciphering the Journal^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sage Paluna^Sage Paluna^The Damaged Journal^^The Runic Prophecies, Pounding the Iron^Bring a sprig of Spiritsbreath to Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah.^Vor'takh is right -- we cannot allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers. Fortunately, I think I know of a way to translate the journal of this Brann. The shamans of the Redfang furbolgs, who congregate at the Heart's Blood Shrine south of the camp, grow an herb known as spiritsbreath. An experienced mystic can use incense made from it to seek wisdom from the spirits of the ancestors. Seek out the shaman known as Grumbald One-Eye. He should carry the herb for his devotions to Ursoc.A Strange Device^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Goramosh's Strange Device^Image of Archmage Modera^A Strange Device^^^Deliver Goramosh's Strange Device to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.^Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to connote any other kind of use. Perhaps the archmage back at Stars' Rest to the east of the Moonrest Gardens would be able to tell what it's used for?Marked for Death: High Cultist Zangus^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Captain Gort^Captain Gort^^Agmar's Hammer^^Kill High Cultist Zangus and return High Cultist Zangus's Head to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.^I witnessed his treachery with my own eyes! The traitor led an Anub'ar assault on this stronghold, taking out some of my best soldiers. <Gort shakes his head.> He'd been working with the Scourge the whole time and we didn't have a clue! How many more like Zangus are there? We'll find 'em all and when we do... <Gort makes a cutting motion across his neck.> First on the list is Zangus. Our scouts report that he is hiding in The Pit of Narjun, west of here. Find him, kill him, bring me his head.The Flesh-Bound Tome^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Flesh-bound Tome^Captain Gort^The Flesh-Bound Tome^^^Return the Flesh-bound Tome to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.^The tome is bound in flesh and appears to be bleeding. Upon examination you discover page after page filled with strange symbols that appear to be written in blood. Whatever knowledge is held within the pages of this tome could be important. Return it to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer, east of Icemist Village.The Runic Prophecies^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sage Paluna^Sage Paluna^The Runic Prophecies^Deciphering the Journal^In the Name of Loken^Sage Paluna at Camp Oneqwah wants you to decipher the three Rune Plates.^Brann's journal also contained a guide to iron dwarf symbols. I've inscribed these on a keystone which will help you to understand the words inscribed on the rune plates. From the journal entries, it seems Brann may be chasing after clues to the origins of his people. Keep your eyes open for any clues as to his destination. Return to Thor Modan, northeast of here, stand before each of the plates, and use the stone to determine the contents of each. We can't allow the Alliance to find him first.A Strange Device^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Goramosh's Strange Device^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^A Strange Device^^^Deliver Goramosh's Strange Device to the Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer.^Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to connote any other kind of use. Perhaps the archmage back at Agmar's Hammer to the northeast of the Moonrest Gardens would be able to tell what it's used for?Projections and Plans^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Image of Archmage Modera^A Strange Device^^^Get close to and observe the projection atop the Surge Needle floating above Moonrest Gardens.^This is a teleportation device. If I had to guess, I'd say that it leads to the surge needle platform floating above the Moonrest Gardens to the west. I need you to use it to investigate what's up there. It appears that the device works both ways so you shouldn't have to jump off. I expect that once you teleport to the top of the surge needle, there will be some sort of apparatus on it to observe. You should be able to use the teleporter from anywhere within the gardens.Projections and Plans^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^A Strange Device^^^Get close to and observe the projection atop the Surge Needle floating above Moonrest Gardens.^This is a teleportation device. If I had to guess, I'd say that it leads to the surge needle platform floating above the Moonrest Gardens to the southwest. <name>, I need you to use it to investigate what's up there. It appears that the device works both ways so you shouldn't have to jump off. I expect that once you teleport up to the top of the surge needle, there will be some sort of apparatus on it to observe. You should be able to use the teleporter from anywhere within the gardens.Strength of Icemist^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Greatmother Icemist^Banthok Icemist^Strength of Icemist^From the Depths of Azjol-Nerub^^Find Banthok Icemist at Icemist Village.^<Greatmother Icemist bows.> It is an honor to meet you, hero. It is because of your actions that many of us are here now, alive and ready for battle against the Scourge. You have done so much for us that it shames me to ask you for your assistance once more. Despite my pleas, my only son, Banthok, left here to go in search of his father, High Chief Icemist. He was last seen heading west, towards Icemist Village. Please find Banthok. I do not know what I would do if I lost my son.Chains of the Anub'ar^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Banthok Icemist^Banthok Icemist^Strength of Icemist^^^Banthok Icemist at Icemist Village in the Dragonblight has asked that you bring him Anok'ra's Key Fragment, Tivax's Key Fragment and Sinok's Key Fragment.^They have my father bound by magical chains in the middle of Icemist Village. From what I have been able to gather, the prison is controlled by three powerful Anub'ar magi - each holding a piece of the key. Scour Icemist and locate the magi. Kill them and take their key fragments. With all three pieces we might be able to free my father. Once he is free... Retribution will come swiftly.The Focus on the Beach^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Image of Archmage Modera^A Strange Device^^^Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Ring and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus on the Glittering Strand.^The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand to the south of Moonrest Gardens. My guess is that you'll find a heavily guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it. No doubt the captain will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus. With any luck, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there.The Focus on the Beach^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^A Strange Device^^Strengthen the Ancients^Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Ring and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus on the Glittering Strand.^The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand to the south of Moonrest Gardens. My guess is that you'll find a heavily guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it. No doubt the captain of the force down there will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus. With any skill on your part, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there.A Letter for Home^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Captain Malin's Letter^Commander Saia Azuresteel^^^^Deliver Captain Malin's Letter to Commander Saia Azuresteel at Stars' Rest.^You find a letter secreted in the lining of her robes. It reads: "Father, I'm sorry for disappearing on you. If you're reading this letter, then I'm dead. I've been forced to work for Malygos's armies under threat that our family would be killed if I didn't. I feel so ashamed. If there's anything that you can do to fight them, don't worry about me. I have them fooled and I'm sabotaging them from the inside. I love you, Daddy! Em" Commander Saia Azuresteel will want to see this!Voices From the Dust^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Image of Drakuru^Image of Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^^Drakuru wants you to collect the Drakkari Tablets from the Ruins of Drakil'jin and 5 Sacred Mojo from Drakkari Oracles and Protectors there. You are then to use Drakuru's Elixir at Drakuru's Brazier at the ruins to summon his image.^<Drakuru places the Eye of the Prophets on his brow and the Heart of the Ancients on his chest.> We be close, mon, very close! The Drakkari Tablets be all dat remain ta be found. Nobody be knowin' how old dey be or what dey be sayin', but with the eye and the heart Drakuru can be readin' dem. Dey lie deep inside the crypt at Drakil'jin, due east of here. Once ya got the tablets, get sacred mojo from the oracles and protectors so ya can summon me there. They'd be proud to be dyin' for such a cause.Return of the High Chief^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Banthok Icemist^Overlord Agmar^Strength of Icemist^^^Free High Chief Icemist using the Anub'ar Prison Key and assist him in defeating Under-king Anub'et'kan.^<Banthok hands you the prison key.> You must hurry, <name>. Take the key and use it to unchain my father from the Anub'ar prison. Once he is freed, assist him in destroying the Anub'ar leader, Under-king Anub'et'kan. When the Under-king is defeated, take from his chitinous carapace a fragment as a trophy to present to the Horde at Agmar's Hammer. Let Agmar see the might of the High Chief!Rallying the Troops^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kurun^Kurun^Find Kurun!^^^Use the Shard of the Earth to rally the Grizzly Hills Giants fighting in the Boulder Hills, kill any iron dwarves who oppose you, then report to Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan.^The sons of iron have used their runes to enthrall many of my brothers and are using them to break the siege on Thor Modan. I wish we did not have to fight them, but we have no choice. My giants will not hold out long against them. I have imbued this earthen shard with a blessing that will aid our allies. Take it with you to the battle in the Boulder Hills to the north, and use it to reassure and fortify my brethren. Kill any iron dwarves who would stand in your way.Attack by Air!^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Senior Sergeant Juktok^Valnok Windrager^Victory Nears...^^^Speak with Valnok Windrager at Agmar's Hammer.^They have seen the might of the Horde by land, now they must feel it from the air! I want you to report to Valnok Windrager at once! You will find him here, in Agmar's Hammer. Valnok has already been briefed on your mission and is expecting you.Blightbeasts be Damned!^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Valnok Windrager^Valnok Windrager^Victory Nears...^^The Kor'kron Vanguard!^Use Valnok's Flare Gun to call down a Kor'kron War Rider at Icemist Village. Mount the Kor'kron War Rider and then use it to kill 25 Anub'ar Blightbeasts!^You've no doubt seen the army of Anub'ar blightbeasts that are being constructed at Icemist Village. The Anub'ar have plans to send those monsters against our soldiers at the Wrathgate. This cannot happen! Venture west to Icemist Village with this flare gun and use it to call down one of my war riders. Climb on its back and command it to destroy the blightbeasts that are out of reach from the ground! Once you have decimated their aerial forces, return to me for your reward!Pounding the Iron^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Scout Vor'takh^Pounding the Iron^Deciphering the Journal^In the Name of Loken^Kill any 10 Iron Dwarves defending Thor Modan and report back to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.^The Alliance isn't the only force opposing us in Grizzly Hills. The iron dwarves have firm control of the eastern coast, although Thor Modan, to the northeast, is besieged by stone giants. A skilled warrior uses an enemy's weakness against him and we would be fools to ignore the vulnerability of the iron dwarves at Thor Modan. Show the iron dwarves no mercy. Slay any and all who would stand in your way. The 'sons of iron' will learn to fear the Horde.An Expedient Ally^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Kurun^An Expedient Ally^^Raining Down Destruction^Speak with Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan.^The old iron dwarf capital of Thor Modan, far to the northeast, is under siege by a mysterious band of stone giants and earthen. Why the creations of the titans would war against each other is beyond my understanding and the Horde's interest, but there is an opportunity here to weaken a mutual enemy. Travel to Thor Modan and seek out this 'Kurun' who commands the giants and earthen. Make common cause with him and use his forces to crush the iron dwarves.Slim Pickings^74^All^Dragonblight^Zort^Zort^Stiff Negotiations^^^Collect a sample of Rockflesh from the Ice Giant corpse at the cavern entrance in the Crystal Vice, north of Zort's location. After this task is complete, return to Zort near the center of the canyon.^Cold out here, isn't it, <race>? Ko'char has refused to meet with me. It seems he has more pressing things on his mind - namely, the jormungar that have been attacking them from the cavern below. Maybe you can help me convince Ko'char that I'm one of the good guys. I saw a giant being eaten by some of the worms at the entrance to the cavern north of here... I'm still puzzled as to how the worms are killing them so easily. Bring me a sample from one of his wounds.Messy Business^74^All^Dragonblight^Zort^Zort^Stiff Negotiations^^^Collect 2 Vials of Corrosive Spit from the Jormungar by using the scraper on yourself. Bring the vials back to Zort in the Crystal Vice when your task is complete.^Even at first glance, the sample you brought me shows obvious signs of some kind of corrosive spit. It would be a natural assumption that the same substance these worms use to burrow through the ground has allowed them a formidable weapon against the Ice Giants. Take this scraper and pick a fight with some of the worms. When they spit on you, use the scraper to remove it and bring it back to me. Get me a couple samples - I'm going to have to use it as the base for an elixir.Apply This Twice A Day^74^All^Dragonblight^Zort^Ko'char the Unbreakable^Stiff Negotiations^^^Offer the elixir that Zort has prepared to Ko'char the Unbreakable.^This elixir should protect against their spit. Offer it to Ko'char for me, will you? Tell him there's plenty more where that came from if he'll return the favor.Worm Wrangler^74^All^Dragonblight^Zort^Zort^^^^Enter the caverns in Crystal Vice and trap 3 Jormungar Spawn inside sturdy crates. Be sure to pick the crates up after the Jormungar Spawn are trapped inside!^So be it. If the giants will not come to our aid, perhaps we can make use of these worms. There are sure to be some spawn with their brood mother in the cavern below. Take this box and capture 3 of their spawn and bring them to me. Where diplomacy fails, enslaving is a perfectly viable alternative.Stomping Grounds^74^All^Dragonblight^Ko'char the Unbreakable^Ko'char the Unbreakable^^^^Delve into the cavern at the north end of the Crystal Vice and kill 8 Ice Heart Jormungar Feeders for Ko'char the Unbreakable.^Greetings little one. I know not what madness has brought you to the Crystal Vice, but you are welcome in my presence. These ice worms... these jormungar have taken a taste to eating my brothers. I doubt you will find my kind friendly by any terms during this time of battle, but if you are here to help with the worms, then you have my ear. If we are to take the cavern back, we must first clear the canyon of these jormungar feeders. Join us in battle, <race>!Really Big Worm^74^All^Dragonblight^Ko'char the Unbreakable^Ko'char the Unbreakable^^^^Enter the Ice Heart Cavern and slay Rattlebore. If it is still in your possession, be sure to use Zort's Protective Elixir to protect you from the Jormungar's corrosive spit.^The jormungar have a spawnmother in the caverns below. We call her Rattlebore - a name that was gifted to her by an adventurer from the Plaguelands. I saw her only briefly as I was fighting off their initial onslaught - she is large enough to make even my icy bones shiver. This cavern will not be ours until she is removed from it. Gather your friends and end this.Gavrock^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kurun^Gavrock^Find Kurun!^^^Speak with Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys.^Without your help, we wouldn't have been able to turn the tide of the battle for Thor Modan. This ancient city has long been a battlefield between the forces of earth and stone. I can only hope we have silenced it for the last time. The iron dwarves can still use their magic to capture and enslave my brothers. Gavrock is searching for a way to free the runed giants. Look for him on a small cluster of islands, called the Ruins of Tethys, off the central part of the Eastwind Shore to the south.Dun-da-Dun-tah!^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Harrison Jones^Harkor^^^^Escort Harrison from Drakil'jin Ruins, then speak with Harkor at Harkor's Camp.^Listen, kid. This is no place for you to be playin' around. I'm about to make a break for it. Stick with me and I'll get you outta here.Atop the Woodlands^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Image of Archmage Modera^A Strange Device^^^Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Amulet and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the Lothalor Woodlands.^I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though. My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the southeast. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own. Be careful, <name>, those woods are very dangerous.Atop the Woodlands^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^A Strange Device^^^Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Amulet and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the Lothalor Woodlands.^I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though. My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the south. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own. Be quick about your business, <class>. I feel that time may be running out.A Letter for Home^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Lieutenant Ta'zinni's Letter^Overlord Agmar^^^^Deliver Lieutenant Ta'zinni's Letter to Overlord Agmar at Agmar's Hammer.^You find a letter secreted in the lining of his robes. It reads: "Deino, Ta'zinni sorry for disappearing on ya. If you're reading this letter, then I be dead. I been forced to work for Malygos's armies under threat that the family would be killed if I didn't. Ta'zinni wasn't gonna let that happen! Don't worry about me, just keep your kids safe. I have them fooled and I'm sabotaging them from the inside. I love you, sistah! Ta'zinni" Overlord Agmar is sure to want to see this!The Son of Karkut^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Ataika^Corporal Venn^Word on the Street^^^Go east to Death's Stand, just beyond Unu'pe.^The man you seek went far to the east, to a place near the coast called Death's Stand, beyond Unu'pe. Be careful if you go in search of him, <name>. He bore the mark of Karkut... he who watches over the dead.Thassarian, the Death Knight^72^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Corporal Venn^Thassarian^Word on the Street^^^Look for Thassarian inside the Wailing Ziggurat, north of Death's Stand.^Well, <name>, you helped us out... so I figure it's only fair that we help you out as well. You're looking for Thassarian? He disappeared this morning. We think he went off north to the Wailing Ziggurat. If we hadn't fought side by side by him we'd even think he was a traitor. See, he's a Death Knight... and I know they're on our side and all... but it wasn't too long ago they were servants of Arthas. But not Thassarian, he's a good guy. Go to the Wailing Ziggurat, see if he's doing okay.Wanted: Magister Keldonus^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Wanted!^Captain Gort^^^To Dragon's Fall^Slay Magister Keldonus and return to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.^By decree of Overlord Agmar: Target: Magister Keldonus Crime: Treason Status: Alive Magister Keldonus, once mage commander of Agmar's Hammer, is to be killed on sight in the name of the Horde. Keldonus was last seen traveling southwest towards Moonrest Gardens to join the Blue Dragonflight in their campaign against magic. Approach with caution as Keldonus is a powerful magus. Do not engage solo! All bounties are paid out by Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.Wanted: Gigantaur^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Wanted!^Captain Gort^^^To Dragon's Fall^Slay Gigantaur and return to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.^By decree of Overlord Agmar: Target: Gigantaur Crime: Attacks upon the Horde; "Bein' ugly" Status: Alive The magnataur lord, Gigantaur, is wanted in relation to a number of attacks against Horde soldiers and installations in the Dragonblight. Gigantaur was last seen wandering the woods and roads south by southeast of Agmar's Hammer. Gigantaur should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Do not engage solo! All bounties are paid out by Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.Wanted: Dreadtalon^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Wanted!^Captain Gort^^^To Dragon's Fall^Slay Dreadtalon and return to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight.^By decree of Overlord Agmar: Target: Dreadtalon Crime: Attacks upon the Horde Status: Alive Dreadtalon is wanted for numerous attacks upon Horde caravans traveling to and from Venomspite. Dreadtalon makes his home on a bluff overlooking the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of Agmar's Hammer. He should be approached with extreme caution. Do not engage solo! All bounties are paid out by Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.Strengthen the Ancients^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Sarendryana^Sarendryana^^^^Use the Bark of the Walkers to strengthen 3 Lothalor Ancients and then return to Sarendryana at Stars' Rest.^It's not only the <race> race that has been impacted by what the blue dragonflight forces have done. The ancients of the Lothalor Woods to the southeast have been affected as well. Some have been corrupted-- avoid them at all costs--but most can still be saved. However, the treants of the woods seem to be immune to the magic seeping through the land and the arcane wyrms that have come with it. Ask the treants for their bark and feed it to the ancients. Hopefully that will be enough to save them.Runes of Compulsion^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Gavrock^Gavrock^Find Kurun!^^^Gavrock, at the Ruins of Tethys, wants you to neutralize the four Runes of Compulsion by defeating Overseer Durval, Overseer Korgan, Overseer Lochli, and Overseer Brunon.^Even as Kurun attacks Thor Modan, the iron dwarves work their magics against our brothers. Summoning our brothers from the earth, then binding them with runes, the sons of iron force them to war against the children of stone. Along the Eastwind Shore, they use runes of compulsion to send enslaved giants to the battlefields of the north. Find the four runes of compulsion and force their overseers to appear by defeating the rune-weavers who man each rune. Without the overseers, the runes are useless.Latent Power^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Gavrock^Gavrock^Find Kurun!^^^Charge the Shard of Gavrock at the First Ancient Stone, the Second Ancient Stone, and the Third Ancient Stone, then return to Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys.^While the runes of compulsion are dormant, there is a chance we can release the runed giants. I will give you a piece of stone that has been part of me since my creation. If properly imbued, it can be used to free the bound giants. Two ancient stone markers sit atop places of power between the Path of Iron and the forest's edge -- locations your people would call the intersections of ley lines. The other is on an island at the southern end of these ruins. Charge the shard at each stone and return.To Dragon's Fall^75^Horde^Dragonblight^Captain Gort^Rokhan^To Dragon's Fall^Wanted: Magister Keldonus, Wanted: Gigantaur, Wanted: Dreadtalon^^Speak with Rokhan at Dragon's Fall in the Dragonblight.^East of here, in the heart of the Dragonblight, is a field full of nothing but dragon bones and snow. The Scourge have set up multiple camps in the central tundra and are raising frostwyrms to send against our forces at the Wrathgate. While most of these frostwyrms are easily dealt with by Rokhan and his dragon hunters, one of them is proving to be a bit problematic. Go northeast and seek out Rokhan at Dragon's Fall. Help him and his men put down Sarathstra and you'll be rewarded handsomely!Strengthen the Ancients^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Earthwarden Grife^Earthwarden Grife^^The Focus on the Beach^^Use the Bark of the Walkers to strengthen 3 Lothalor Ancients and then return to Earthwarden Grife at Agmar's Hammer.^The ancients of the Lothalor Woods to the south are being corrupted by arcane wyrms... wyrms which have risen out of the ground! Those that are already corrupted are deadly and of no use to us, but most can still be saved. Luckily, the treants of the woods seem to be immune to everything happening up there. Ask the treants for their bark and when you get some, feed it to the ancients. This should strengthen them. Now leave me to my business! I have to keep an eye on these apothecaries.Sarathstra, Scourge of the North^75^Horde^Dragonblight^Rokhan^Captain Gort^To Dragon's Fall^^^Speak with Rokhan to call down the frostwyrm, Sarathstra.^Me hunters be dead or frozen, <name>. Just you and whatever allies you bring wit ya is all da help you get. You still want to do dis? Just say da word and me call for da dragon once more. If ya kill it, take da beast's frozen heart back to Agmar's Hammer and present it to Gort. He sure to reward you good, mon.Search Indu'le Village^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Mage-Commander Evenstar^A Strange Device^^^Search for the commander of the mage hunter forces at Indu'le Village and Lake Indu'le.^I'm certain that you'll find the next ley line focus somewhere in the remains of Indu'le Village to the southeast. The problem is, we've had absolutely no reports of there being one there. If you would, please investigate the village for any signs of the focus or the mage hunters and their commander in the area. Don't forget to search in the lake if you have to.Free at Last^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Gavrock^Gavrock^Find Kurun!^^^Use Gavrock's Runebreaker to free 4 Runed Giants, then return to Gavrock at the Ruins of Tethys.^The rock shard you imbued should be powerful enough to break the runic magic binding my brothers. Take it with you and find the runed giants walking north along the Eastwind Shore. Unleash the power stored in the stone and observe the results. If it works, the runed giants should return to their senses and stop obeying the iron dwarves. If the stone fails to work, the giants may attack in a weakened state. But, what choice do we have? If we do not try, they will remain enslaved without hope.Containing the Rot^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Soar Hawkfury^Soar Hawkfury^Containing the Rot^Agmar's Hammer^^Soar Hawkfury at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to kill 15 Infected Wildlife and recover a Rot Resistant Organ.^With Scourge comes death and disease. We often overlook that the wildlife of a Scourge infested area is ravaged and ultimately destroyed by rot and contagion. For most of the indigenous beasts of the Dragonblight it is too late. The festering disease that the Scourge brings has already infected the beasts and they are now rabid and rotting. You must venture west, towards the Pit of Narjun, and cull the infected wildlife. Check their corpses for a preserved organ as we need one to devise a vaccine.The Good Doctor...^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Soar Hawkfury^Doctor Sintar Malefious^Containing the Rot^^^Deliver the Rot Resistant Organ to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer.^Our Forsaken allies have sent their apothecary core here to assist us in destroying the Scourge at the Wrathgate. One among them, Doctor Sintar Malefious, is well versed in the Scourge rot and methods of containing the spread. I had previously worked out a deal with him in regards to devising a vaccine for wildlife. He's since been waiting on the organ. Deliver this rot resistant organ to Dr. Malefious and let him know it's from me. He'll direct you on your next task.In Search of the Ruby Lilac^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Doctor Sintar Malefious^Doctor Sintar Malefious^Containing the Rot^^^Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to collect 1 Ruby Lilac.^How fortuitous it is that the Ruby Dragonshrine lays just to the east. It is there that you will find a flower called the ruby lilac. This lifegiving plant is all that I need to concoct a vaccine for the untainted beasts of this region. Travel east and search the Ruby Dragonshrine for the lilac. Just one thing: The dragonshrine, like all the dragonshrines in this blasted wasteland, is beset by the Scourge. Watch your step. We wouldn't want you to be devoured by an emberwyrm. <Sintar laughs.>Return to Soar^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Doctor Sintar Malefious^Soar Hawkfury^Containing the Rot^^^Deliver Sintar's Vaccine to Soar Hawkfury at Agmar's Hammer.^<Doctor Malefious hands you a vial full of murky liquid.> Here you are then, <race>. Take this back to the cow and let him know that all debts have been paid. We are officially "square." Now leave me before I set Jennings upon you.Descent into Darkness^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Mikhail's Journal^Lieutenant Dumont^Descent into Darkness^^^Bring Mikhail's Journal to Lieutenant Dumont in Amberpine Lodge.^The journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail. It details the arrival of a shadow-worshipping group called the "wolfcult." The villagers were reluctant to embrace the cult at first, but sympathizers sprung up gradually among town residents. Unsettled by this, Mikhail sent his daughter Sasha away from Silverbrook while he attempted to reason with the other villagers. Mikhail's last entry mentions a meeting of local town leaders to discuss unspecified events in Hollowstone Mine.Search Indu'le Village^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Mage-Commander Evenstar^A Strange Device^^^Search for the commander of the mage hunter forces at Indu'le Village and Lake Indu'le.^I'm certain that you'll find the next ley line focus somewhere in the remains of Indu'le Village to the southeast. The problem is, I've had absolutely no reports of there being one there. I need you to go investigate the village for any signs of the focus or the mage hunters and their commander in the area. Search in the lake if you have to!The End of the Line^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Mage-Commander Evenstar^Image of Archmage Modera^A Strange Device^^^Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under Lake Indu'le. Then, head east to the Azure Dragonshrine near south central Dragonblight and observe what is occurring there from the western ledge.^Within his robes you find two things of interest. One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens. The water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine. Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge.Report to Gryan Stoutmantle... Again^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Dumont^Captain Gryan Stoutmantle^Descent into Darkness^^^Speak to Captain Gryan Stoutmantle at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^The Westfall boys were sent east to look for a path into the northern territories. Their secondary objective is to secure strategic resource points, so I'm sure they wouldn't mind investigating a mine. Look for the Westfall Brigade encampment far to the northeast and seek out Gryan Stoutmantle. You might remember him if you ever spent any time in Westfall. Make sure to tell him I sent you. He'll be more than happy to let you claim a functioning mine for the king.The End of the Line^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Mage-Commander Evenstar^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^A Strange Device^^^Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under Lake Indu'le. Then, head east to the Azure Dragonshrine near south central Dragonblight and observe what is occurring there from the western ledge^Within his robes you find two things of interest. One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens. The fragile water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine. Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge.Where the Wild Things Roam^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Soar Hawkfury^Soar Hawkfury^Containing the Rot^^^Soar Hawkfury at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Pack of Vaccine to vaccinate 5 Snowfall Elk and 5 Arctic Grizzlies.^Inside this pack are several vials containing the vaccine that Sintar created. I now want you to search the nearby woods for Snowfall elk and arctic grizzlies. When you locate the animals, find a safe distance and throw a vial in their general direction. The vial will shatter and release a fine gas that will act as the inoculating agent. The beasts merely have to step inside the gas and they will be vaccinated - ultimately saved. Inoculate as many of the beasts as you can and return to me.Stiff Negotiations^74^All^Dragonblight^Narf^Zort^Stiff Negotiations^^^Locate Zort in the center of the Crystal Vice, northeast of Nozzlerust Post.^Well it seems you were of a bit of use after all. It's not been my experience to meet many a <race> that are. We don't have any more use for you here. Head into the Vice and see if my brother Zort could use a hand. He went to see if he could con the giants into laying down their lives so that we don't have to. He certainly wasn't known for having the brains in the family.Nice to Meat You^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Harkor^Harkor^^^^Harkor at Harkor's Camp wants you to collect 10 pieces of Fibrous Worg Meat from Duskhowl Prowlers and 10 Shovelhorn Steaks from Longhoof Grazers.^G'day to ya, <class>! Have yerself a seat by me fire, eh? I'd offer to share a nice hot meal, only I ain't got one. I'm stuck here waitin' on an associate, or I'd be out tryin' to remedy that situation meself. Say, you seem to have nuthin' but time on yer hands and there be plenty o' meat in these parts. What say ya lend a hand and round up some grub?Therapy^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Harkor^Harkor^^^^Harkor at Harkor's Camp wants you to kill 10 Drakkari Protectors and 10 Drakkari Oracles outside Drakil'jin Ruins.^Trolls... me hates 'em all! <Harkor spits.> I once got meself captured by a band o' tha beasts... came this close ta gettin' me head shrunk! Me friends tell me to just move on and put it all behind me, but that just ain't sittin' right. Wanna know what would make me feel better, <race>? Seein' a pile of their corpses so high it blots out the sun! I've got good gold to spend if ya can make that happen.Koltira and the Language of Death^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Captain Gort^Koltira Deathweaver^The Flesh-Bound Tome^^In Service of Blood, In Service of the Unholy, In Service of Frost^Take the Flesh-Bound Tome to Koltira Deathweaver.^There is one who recently joined our cause that might be able to decipher this tome. An unbound death knight known as Koltira Deathweaver has temporarily taken residence here at Agmar's Hammer. As he was once a death knight of Arthas and member of the Scourge, he might be able to translate the language of the dead. Take the flesh-bound tome to Koltira and ask him to translate the pages.It Takes Guts....^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kraz^Kraz^It Takes Guts....^^^Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to enter Drakil'jin Ruins and collect 5 Drakkari Canopic Jars.^Greetings, <class>. It is kind of you to stop and listen to Kraz's tale. For many years Kraz has strained to hear the spirits and do their bidding. Recently, many voices have been crying to Kraz from these ruins. They seek for a peace they cannot find on their own. If you would help the spirits of those who have come before, enter this crypt and collect something that once belonged to those tormented souls.Travel to Moa'ki Harbor^72^All^Dragonblight^Hotawa^Elder Ko'nani^^The Tides Turn^^Travel to Moa'ki Harbor in the Dragonblight and speak with Elder Ko'nani.^<race>, word just arrived from Moa'ki Harbor. Something very bad happened over there this morning! You've been very helpful to us here. Would you consider using the boat from Unu'pe to travel to the great Dragonblight? By the sound of things, Elder Ko'nani could certainly use your assistance.Travel to Moa'ki Harbor^72^All^Dragonblight^Anuniaq^Elder Ko'nani^^Avenge Iskaal^^Travel to Moa'ki Harbor in the Dragonblight and speak with Elder Ko'nani.^<race>, word just came in off the boat from Moa'ki Harbor. Something very bad happened over there this morning! You've been very helpful to us here. Would you consider using the boat to travel to the great Dragonblight? By the sound of things, Elder Ko'nani could certainly use your assistance.Gaining an Audience^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Modera^Tariolstrasz^A Strange Device^^^Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.^<name>, you must travel as swiftly as you can to Wyrmrest Temple and present this letter to the steward, Tariolstrasz. The temple sits in the center of the Dragonblight. Follow the road east until it ends, and then cross The Dragon Wastes to get to it. I'm sure that when the steward reads your introduction, he'll see to it that you gain an audience with Queen Alexstrasza. We can only hope that we're not too late. Thank you for all that you have done on our behalf. Safe journeys!Drak'aguul's Mallet^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kraz^Kraz^It Takes Guts....^^^Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to slay Drak'aguul outside Drakil'jin Ruins and return with the Drakil'jin Mallet.^Corruption.... Even before you delivered these jars, Kraz could sense it. This corruption fills the ancient Drakkari spirits with great angst and prevents them from entering the rest they seek. Kraz will not lie, <class>. Cleansing this place will require great sacrifice, but we shall speak of that at another time. There is one among the living here who holds the key to its cleansing. Seek out Drak'aguul and return to Kraz with the mallet he carries.See You on the Other Side^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kraz^Gan'jo^It Takes Guts....^^^Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to use the Drakil'jin Mallet on the gongs outside Drakil'jin Ruins. Once you have been slain, you are to enter the ruins and speak with the spirit of Gan'jo while you are dead.^These Drakkari have met you with nothing but savage hostility. You owe them nothing. Few indeed would carry out the task that Kraz asks of you today. To cleanse this place and send the spirits to their eternal rest, you must join them in death. There is one inside the crypt who awaits you - on the other side. He holds the knowledge we seek, <name>. Use the mallet on the gongs. The spirit of he who corrupts this place will surely deliver you to the spirit world. Kraz awaits your return.Gaining an Audience^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Tariolstrasz^A Strange Device^^^Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.^<name>, you must travel as swiftly as you can to Wyrmrest Temple and present this letter to the steward, Tariolstrasz. The temple sits in the center of the Dragonblight. Follow the road east until it ends, and then cross The Dragon Wastes to get to it. I'm sure that when the steward reads your introduction, he'll see to it that you gain an audience with Queen Alexstrasza. We can only hope that we're not too late. Thank you for all that you have done on our behalf. Safe journeys!Informing the Queen^75^Alliance^Dragonblight^Tariolstrasz^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^A Strange Device^^Report to Lord Afrasastrasz^Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple.^<The dragon steward pulls your letter of introduction out of his sleeve.> Yes... yes, I think that you are ready to see the queen now. When you are ready, speak to me again and I will see to it that one of these drakes delivers you safely to the top of the temple. You will need to present your letter in person to Queen Alexstrasza.Informing the Queen^75^Horde^Dragonblight^Tariolstrasz^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^A Strange Device^^Report to Lord Afrasastrasz^Deliver your Letter of Introduction to Wyrmrest Temple to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple.^<The dragon steward pulls your letter of introduction out of his sleeve.> Yes... yes, I think that you are ready to see the queen now. When you are ready, speak to me again and I will see to it that one of these drakes delivers you safely to the top of the temple. You will need to present your letter in person to Queen Alexstrasza.In Service of Blood^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Koltira and the Language of Death^The Power to Destroy^Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Blood Gem on a Deranged Indu'le Villager and return to him with a Filled Blood Gem.^The blood of innocents was once used to sate the thirst of the blade. Alas, such options are no longer available to me. <Koltira pauses to think.> We must improvise. South of here, upon the high bluffs, is the tuskarr village of Indu'le. Having been recently overrun by the Blue Dragonflight's chaotic magic, the resident tuskarr of Indu'le have gone mad. Take this blood gem and use it on a deranged villager. If I cannot take the blood of innocents, I shall have the blood of the meek!In Service of the Unholy^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Koltira and the Language of Death^The Power to Destroy^Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Unholy Gem on Duke Vallenhal and return to him with a Filled Unholy Gem.^The power of the unholy is coveted among my kind. It makes up the very fiber of our existence, granting death to those that dare make a mockery of it! Thankfully there is a font from which I may draw from in my time of need. Take this unholy gem and make your way to the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of here. It is there that you will find Duke Vallenhal, death knight of Arthas. Weaken his resolve in battle and unleash the power of the gem upon him. It will finish him off and steal his unholy energy!In Service of Frost^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Koltira and the Language of Death^The Power to Destroy^Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to use the Frost Gem on Ice Revenants and return to him with a Filled Frost Gem.^The biting cold protects the death knight while repelling his enemies. He that commands the power of frost can incite chaos and destruction! Take this frost gem and travel far across the open tundra of the Dragonblight until you come upon the Mirror of Dawn, east of Wyrmrest Temple. It is there that you are to battle the legions of ice revenants that dwell upon the lakes surface and take from them the essence of frost. Utilize the power of the gem when they are weak, <name>!Check Up on Raegar^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Brugar Stoneshear^Raegar Breakbrow^Check Up on Raegar^Steady as a Rock?^^Speak with Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^With all the excitement about the army trying to move through Thor Modan, I'd almost forgotten about Raegar's crew down at Prospector's Point. I sent Raegar and his assistants, along with a mountaineer friend, down to establish a small post near Dun Argol, at the southern end of the Eastwind Shore. They were to investigate the iron dwarf presence in the southern hills, but I haven't received any reports yet. Could you check up on them if you're going down that way?The Perfect Plan^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Raegar Breakbrow^Raegar Breakbrow^Check Up on Raegar^^^Bring the completed War Golem Blueprint to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^The iron dwarves are making no secret of the fact that they're preparing for war. With their giants, golems, and lightning elementals, they'd have a technological advantage against the Westfall Brigade. If they don't find passage north in time, the irons could take them by surprise. We've got to tie them up here, and I've got just the way to do it. Dun Argol is full of rune-smiths churning out war golems. They carry plans for specific pieces, so you'll need to find and assemble all the parts.Why Fabricate When You Can Appropriate?^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Raegar Breakbrow^Raegar Breakbrow^Check Up on Raegar^^^Bring 8 War Golem Parts to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^We've got the blueprints, but we can't do anything with them without parts! We don't have access to a foundry, much less materials, but there's a whole load of parts up in Dun Argol. Your job? Give them a new home. They're likely to be scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working, and I wouldn't blame the irons for being cranky when you try to filch their handiwork. The more parts you can bring, the better we can make this golem.We Have the Power^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Raegar Breakbrow^Raegar Breakbrow^Check Up on Raegar^^^Bring Durar's Power Cell and Kathorn's Power Cell to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^We're almost there, but the war golem won't run without power cells. From the information I was able to collect in Dun Argol before we were discovered, both Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn each create one power cell. We'll need one power cell from each of the rune-smiths before our golem will work. You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.The Power to Destroy^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^The Power to Destroy^In Service of Blood, In Service of the Unholy, In Service of Frost^^Koltira Deathweaver at Agmar's Hammer in the Dragonblight wants you to enter the world of shadows and defeat 6 Shadowy Tormentors.^While you have done much for me, one task remains. Beside the world you know exists another world. It is from that world, the world of shadows, that my tormentors assault me. While I am powerless to face my own demons, you could end their reign of terror. You have the strength, I have seen it with my own eyes. Enter the world of shadows and face the demons that torment me! Do this and I will translate the tome, as promised.Sasha's Hunt^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Sasha^Sasha^^Fate and Coincidence^^Sasha wants you to kill 12 Solstice Hunters in Solstice Village.^This thing... this curse... that's affecting Silverbrook and Solstice Village... it makes beasts out of people. My father tried to warn them, but they all listened to the wolfcult instead. They're too far gone now, it's time to put them down... for their own sake.The Translated Tome^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Koltira Deathweaver^Captain Gort^The Power to Destroy^^^Deliver the Translated Flesh-bound Tome to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer.^Here it is, <name>. I have translated everything printed upon the pages of the tome. Inside it you will find a list of the names of Cult of the Damned members spanning the entire continent. Their network of spies and operatives is impressive, to say the least. Farewell, friend. May the book serve you and your people well.Chill Out, Mon^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Gan'jo^Kraz^It Takes Guts....^^^Gan'jo wants you to collect the Snow of Eternal Slumber from his chest in the Drakil'jin Ruins.^It be as the prophecies said, mon. A <race> <class> be comin' to set our spirits to rest. We been waitin' for a long time now! The Drakkari have become a lost people, fierce and savage. But here we suffer by no fault of our own, mon. This place need cleansin' and only the living can do it. Speak to me when ya be ready to rejoin your body. Then take the snow from the chest near me here and put my bruddas to sleep. Take their remnants to your spirit guide. He be knowin' what to do next.... Or Maybe We Don't^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Raegar Breakbrow^Raegar Breakbrow^Check Up on Raegar^^The Iron Thane and His Anvil, Blackout^Charge your War Golem with the energy from 10 Lightning Sentries and return to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^You'd think the guys making the power cells would've thought to power them up, but no, they've got to make it difficult for us. Fine, we'll charge those cells the hard way. There's enough power in them to run the golem for a short time, but don't expect it to be any good in combat. You see the lightning sentries that the irons have posted around the perimeter of Dun Argol? Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, and use the golem to absorb the power as the sentries die.All Hail Roanauk!^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Overlord Agmar^Overlord Agmar^Strength of Icemist^^The Kor'kron Vanguard!^Seek out Roanauk Icemist at Agmar's Hammer and initiate him as a member and leader of the Horde forces.^Like the tauren, Forsaken, trolls and blood elves, so too do the taunka need a leader born of their own blood. The one you saved from Icemist, Roanauk, will be this leader. <Overlord Agmar hands you a parchment.> I give to you something familiar - the blood oath of the Horde. Take the oath to Roanauk Icemist and initiate him into the Horde as leader of the taunka. Let us not keep him waiting. <Agmar nods.>A Diplomatic Mission^71^Alliance^Borean Tundra^Counselor Talbot^Karuk^A Diplomatic Mission^Notify Arlos^^Speak to Karuk at Riplash Strand, southwest of Valiance Keep.^I see that you are very eager to help, <name>. You didn't come all the way to Northrend to stay holed up in a city! I've just the task for you... something that'll take you far away from here. We've long sought to gain the favor of the tuskarr native to Northrend. Recently a young tuskarr came to us seeking help, something we couldn't offer at the time. Now that you're around, maybe you can lend him a hand. Look for Karuk near the Riplash Strand, southwest of here, and see what you can do to help.Pest Control^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Duane^Duane^Pest Control^^^Duane at the 7th Legion Front wants you to kill 10 Snowplain Snobolds and 3 Dragonblight Magnataur at the magnataur camps surrounding Wyrmrest.^Ugh! One of those little snobold runts trashed our camp while we were busy with that last dragon. They've been plaguing us whenever we turn our backs... I've had enough! To the south you'll find the snobolds hiding under the skirts of some of the local magnataur. Go slaughter them. If the magnataur interfere on behalf of their slaves, kill them as well.Canyon Chase^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Duane^Duane^Pest Control^^^Duane wants you to chase the snobolds down the canyon northeast of 7th Legion Front and deal with their leader.^I can't believe this! Another band of those vermin just tried to take off with more of our supplies. They're scurrying off towards that north canyon, get after them and deal with whoever they're going to!Pest Control^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Kontokanis^Kontokanis^Pest Control^^^Kontokanis at Dragon's Fall wants you to kill 10 Snowplain Snobolds and 3 Dragonblight Magnataur at the magnataur camps surrounding Wyrmrest.^Oi, mon! One of dose little snobold runts trashed our camp during da last dragon attack. Dey've been houndin us wheneva we turn our backs and I've had enough. To da east you'll find da snobolds hiding under da skirts of some of da local magnataur. Go slaughter dem. If da magnataur interfere on behalf of deir slaves, kill dem as well.Canyon Chase^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Kontokanis^Kontokanis^Pest Control^^^Kontokanis wants you to chase the snobolds down the canyon south of Dragon's Fall and deal with their leader.^I can't believe dis! Another band of dose vermin just tried ta take off with more of our supplies. Dey're scurrying down da canyon now, get after dem and deal with whoever dey're going to!Disturbing Implications^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Emblazoned Battle Horn^Aurastrasza^Disturbing Implications^^One of a Kind^Bring the Emblazoned Battle Horn to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in assessing the potential threat.^The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and a lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a Magnataur. Take the horn south down the Path of the Titans to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications.Disturbing Implications^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Emblazoned Battle Horn^Aurastrasza^Disturbing Implications^^One of a Kind^Bring the Emblazoned Battle Horn to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in assessing the potential threat.^The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and a lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a Magnataur. Take the horn east across the Dragon Wastes to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications.One of a Kind^73^All^Dragonblight^Aurastrasza^Aurastrasza^Disturbing Implications^^^Find and kill Bonesunder in or near the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine. Bring any evidence you find back to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple.^Such a strange seal to see among magnataur... it suggests an unusual amount of organization. Magnataur rarely put aside their aggressive natures to cooperate with each other. I suspect they have their eyes set on raiding a large settlement. I very much doubt that this horn is unique, I need you to prove me wrong. In the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine you will find Bonesunder. Go challenge him and bring me back any evidence you find that might confirm my concerns.Mighty Magnataur^73^All^Dragonblight^Aurastrasza^Aurastrasza^Disturbing Implications^^^Hunt down and kill Bloodfeast, Iceshatter, and Drakegore east of Wyrmrest^Magnataur are hideously violent creatures... this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat. I will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime. East of here there are 3 torches erected. Near them, there are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader.Reclusive Runemaster^74^All^Dragonblight^Aurastrasza^Aurastrasza^Disturbing Implications^^^Locate Dregmar Runebrand near his cave on the path to the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn. Challenge him and uncover the name of the magnataur leader by any means necessary. Return to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest once the information is obtained.^Dregmar Runebrand is a magnataur runemaster... a rare breed. He's generally solitary, but has been known to associate with the more powerful and influential magnataur in Dragonblight for quite some time. He will know who this new leader is. It is unlikely we will gain any aid with the increasing concerns with the Scourge and the blue flight, so I need you to procure the information from Dregmar by any means necessary. I was told he can be found amongst the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn.Wanton Warlord^74^All^Dragonblight^Aurastrasza^Aurastrasza^Disturbing Implications^^^Travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine and blow the Emblazoned Battle Horn. Defeat Grom'thar the Thunderbringer and bring his head back to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest.^There's no reason to suspect Dregmar's words are anything but true. Whether Grom'thar defeats you or is defeated by you, he can wash his hands of this. Follow his instructions... take the horn that you brought me earlier, travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine, and blow it to announce your challenge. When Grom'thar the Thunderbringer arrives, kill him and bring me his head.Jin'arrak's End^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Kraz^Kraz^It Takes Guts....^^^Kraz at Harkor's Camp wants you to collect the Sacred Drakkari Offering from the Drakil'jin Ruins and use the Drakkari Spirit Dust on it. You must use the Infused Drakkari Offering at the gongs outside of Drakil'jin Ruins.^It is good to see you back among the living. Many who travel the path of the dead do not return to speak of it. While you were away, a vision appeared to Kraz revealing what remains to be done. A sacred offering lies somewhere inside the crypt. Take this spirit dust fashioned from the remnants you collected and use it on the offering. The infused offering will bring an end to the corrupted warlord and will release the many tormented souls. May the spirits guide your actions, <name>.The Iron Thane and His Anvil^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Raegar Breakbrow^Raegar Breakbrow^^... Or Maybe We Don't^^Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^Now that you've charged up your war golem, we're going to put all that energy to good use. Activate the golem inside Dun Argol to take control of it. Our information about Dun Argol's leader, Iron Thane Furyhammer, suggests his bodyguard protects him from all harm. That bodyguard is the construct he travels with, called The Anvil. Disable the construct, and his protection will disappear. The thane stays in the building at the top of Dun Argol and supervises production from the bottom level.Blackout^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Raegar Breakbrow^Raegar Breakbrow^^... Or Maybe We Don't^^Use Raegar's Explosives to destroy the Runic Power Core at Dun Argol, then report to Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.^The large hall at the top of Dun Argol houses the power source for the entire area. If you can destroy the power core, it will cripple Dun Argol for some time. No power means no golems, no sentries, and no more lightning armaments. When we were sent up here, they told us these explosives were for excavation, but thanks to Iron Thane Furyhammer, the research has been scrapped. We may as well get some use out of them, though. They're the only thing we have on hand capable of destroying the power core.The Lost Courier^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Private Casey^Courier Lanson^The Lost Courier^^^Speak to Courier Lanson at Star's Rest in Dragonblight.^We're lucky we made it this far, <name>. We were ambushed by Scourge as soon as we landed. One of our men turned out to be a spy for the Cult of the Damned. Thassarian appears to have more evidence of cultist infiltration. Apparently it goes all the way to the top. I've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name.Hollowstone Mine^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Captain Gryan Stoutmantle^Petrov^Descent into Darkness^^^Look for clues inside Hollowstone Mine northwest of the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^I've been meaning to send some of our lads to check out Hollowstone Mine. Haven't had a chance to yet -- we've had our hands full between the Horde on the west and the iron dwarves to the east. If Dumont sent you, though, the least I can do is point you in the right direction. You'll find the mine entrance to the northwest, not far from here. See if you think operations there can be salvaged. We sure could use the additional resources until our mine in Farshire is operational again.Souls at Unrest^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Petrov^Petrov^Descent into Darkness^^^Petrov at Hollowstone Mine wants you to use the Miner's Lantern to burn the corpses of 8 Hollowstone Miners.^<Petrov looks deeply disturbed, breathing heavily and shifting his gaze nervously around the mine.> My comrades... we must put their souls to rest! I kill them and kill them but.. they just come back! I've had an idea for a while but I just don't have the heart to do it myself. Maybe you can do this for me? Take this lantern and use its oil to burn their remains so they never get up again. I'll answer your questions later. Help my friends first!A Name from the Past^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Petrov^Captain Gryan Stoutmantle^Descent into Darkness^^^Return to Captain Gryan Stoutmantle at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^It worked! It worked! My comrades can finally enjoy their well-earned rest... I'll stay here and finish the job. We Hollowstone miners always finish the job -- we never give up! That's why Arugal made an example of us. We wouldn't fall in line, you see? We wouldn't join his wolfcult!Ruuna the Blind^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Private Arun^Ruuna the Blind^Ruuna the Blind^^^Speak to Ruuna the Blind at Ruuna's Camp near Vordrassil Pass.^Hey there. I overheard what you were saying to the captain and I just want you to know... things aren't that simple in Northrend. Just because someone's dead it doesn't mean they're out of the picture. Southwest of here, near Vordrassil Pass, lives a blind woman who goes by the name Ruuna the Blind. They say she speaks to the dead and has visions of the past and future. I haven't heard your whole story but it sounds like she'd be right up your alley.Hour of the Worg^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Sasha^Sasha^^A Sister's Pledge^^Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post wants you to go to Bloodmoon Isle and slay Selas, Varlam, Goremaw and the Shade of Arugal.^It is time, then, <name>. Arugal must be defeated. Get a couple of people you can trust and head for Bloodmoon Isle. It's just off the coast, east of here. We'll hit them fast. Take out Arugal's lieutenants -- I'll catch up with you when it's time to take out the monster himself.An Intriguing Plan^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Tormak the Scarred^Prospector Rokar^The Unexpected 'Guest'^^^Bring the completed War Golem Blueprints to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.^Prospector Rokar has decided to help us. He's concocted a plan to use the iron dwarves' strength against them. I must admit, our new 'friend' is more insightful than I'd given him credit for. He's correct in that our numbers are too few for a direct attack. Travel to Dun Argol, in the snowy regions to the southeast, and capture all the parts of their war golem blueprints from the iron rune-smiths there. Bring the assembled blueprint to Rokar and we'll see if his plan has any merit.The Liquid Fire of Elune^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Warden Jodi Moonsong^Warden Jodi Moonsong^The Liquid Fire of Elune^^^Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest has asked you to use the Liquid Fire of Elune to cleanse the corpses of 6 Blighted Elk and 6 Rabid Grizzlies.^<race> will you assist me? The Scourge have moved into Icemist to the north. Wherever they go, they spread their taint, and the creatures of the land suffer. Take this vial, which is filled with the liquid fire of Elune from the moonwell. Please, use the liquid to cleanse the corpses of the blighted wildlife that you find.Kill the Cultists^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Warden Jodi Moonsong^Warden Jodi Moonsong^The Liquid Fire of Elune^^^Collect 5 Functional Cultist Suits for Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest.^The Anub'ar cultists are indirectly responsible for the plaguing of the beasts, and we must put an end to it! The fumes that emit from the cultists' suits seep into everything they come near, poisoning and corrupting their surroundings. You must go north to Icemist Village and slay them. Bring back any of their suits that survive your assault and I will see to it that they are properly disposed of.The Favor of Zangus^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^The Favor of Zangus^Warden Jodi Moonsong^The Favor of Zangus^^^Deliver the Favor of Zangus to Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest.^An inscription on the back of the favor reads, "To my favorite pupil, If you continue to show promise, I will teach you wonders beyond your imaginings. If you do not, I will have you destroyed! As ever, High Cultist Zangus" No doubt the warden at Stars' Rest will want to see this.The High Cultist^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Warden Jodi Moonsong^Warden Jodi Moonsong^The Favor of Zangus^^^Warden Jodi Moonsong at Stars' Rest has asked you to slay High Cultist Zangus.^I have dreamed of Zangus before but without the context that you have discovered, I knew not what it meant. You have brought clarity to the vision that the goddess has bestowed upon me, and now I know that he can be found within the Pit of Narjun to the north. You know your target, <name>. If there's to be an end to the suffering of the land, the high cultist must die!Blackriver Brawl^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Raider Captain Kronn^Raider Captain Kronn^^^^Raider Captain Kronn wants you to slay 10 Alliance units or players at the Blackriver Logging Camp.^The Venture Company abandoned operations shortly after we showed up. Clearly they were afraid of what we were going to do to their greedy little hides. With them gone, their logging camps are up for grabs. Our war machine is a hungry beast... without renewing our supplies we won't make it to Icecrown. Unfortunately the Alliance seems to have the same idea and we must make sure we're the ones that prevail. Head into the logging camp and help us fight the Alliance scum.Of Traitors and Treason^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Courier Lanson^Palena Silvercloud^The Lost Courier^^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Show the Alliance Missive to Palena Silvercloud at Stars' Rest.^The list I hold must be delivered to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at Wintergarde Keep on the eastern borders of Dragonblight. If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic. Hurry, <name>. Show the document to Palena Silvercloud here at Stars' Rest and explain the nature of your mission. She will put you on her fastest hippogryph to Wintergarde!Attunement to Dalaran^73^Alliance^Mage^Image of Archmage Modera^Image of Archmage Modera^^^^The Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest has asked you to become Attuned to the Ley Lines of Northrend.^Welcome, mage. By now you must be wondering where Dalaran is and how to get there. I will help you. But before I can teach you how to teleport to our great city, you must attune yourself to the ley lines of Northrend. Otherwise, you risk destroying yourself in the process. Take this attunement crystal and use it in the pit under the surge needle at the Moonrest Gardens to the west. Then you will be ready to learn the spell.Attunement to Dalaran^73^Horde^Mage^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^^^^The Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver at Agmar's Hammer has asked you to become Attuned to the Ley Lines of Northrend.^Hello, mage. By now you must be wondering where Dalaran is and how to get there. I can help you with this if you can survive a simple test. Before I teach you how to teleport to our great city, you must attune yourself to the ley lines of Northrend. Otherwise, you will destroy yourself in the process! Take this attunement crystal and use it in the pit under the surge needle at the Moonrest Gardens to the southwest. Then you will be ready to learn what I have to teach.High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Palena Silvercloud^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^The Lost Courier^^^Deliver the Alliance Missive to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in eastern Dragonblight.^<Palena hands the missive back to you.> Snowstorm will take you to Wintergarde, <name>. I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now!Gray Worg Hides^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Gray Worg Hides^^^Hidetrader Jun'ik in Conquest Hold wants you to get 3 Gray Worg Hides from Graymist Hunters in the woods to the north.^Let me tell you something, mon. When you get put in charge of outfittin' the armies of the Horde, you go through a lot of hides! Conqueror Krenna, the she-wolf runnin' this place, she gave me a tight deadline. If I don't outfit her whole regiment by week's end she's gonna have me wrestling bears in the pit. Help me out and I'll pay you top price. I'll be needin' hides from graymist hunters. You'll find them all around in pockets to the north, hunting stag. Remember, mon. Top price!A Minor Substitution^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Gray Worg Hides^^^Hidetrader Jun'ik wants you to bring him 6 Grizzly Hides.^Krenna, she be wantin' worg hides for all the outfits. There's not gonna be enough worg hides for her army, though. Not now, not ever. Those worgs -- they be skinny, mon! Here's what we're gonna do... if you can keep a secret that is. East of Voldrune there be grizzly bears as fat as an ogre. Those large hides -- those we can use! Hurry, <brother/sister>. Krenna's not known for her patience.Jun'ik's Coverup^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Gray Worg Hides^^^Bring 1 piece of Coal and 5 Simple Flour to Hidetrader Jun'ik at Conquest Hold in Grizzly Hills.^Ah, we have a small problem. Grizzly hides... they be brown, mon! Think... think! I got it, mon! Is like this: gray is black an' white all mixed up. You get me some coal an' some flour, I'll grind it all up and dust the hides with it. No one will know the better! Blacksmiths sell coal for smeltin' an' you can get flour from the provisioner.Delivery to Krenna^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Hidetrader Jun'ik^Conqueror Krenna^Gray Worg Hides^^The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling!^Take the Bundle of Hides to Krenna in Conquest Hold.^This is it, mon. Let's take these hides to Krenna and see if they pass the test. Let's hope for both our sakes Krenna doesn't notice anything.The Captive Prospectors^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Mountaineer Kilian^Mountaineer Kilian^^The Runic Prophecies^Looking the Part^Free Prospector Gann, Prospector Torgan, and Prospector Varana, then return to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.^Raegar sent a team of prospectors into Dun Argol to search for artifacts and information about the history of the settlement. Raegar's team never expected Dun Argol to be this heavily populated. They're being held captive while the iron dwarves prepare for war. We haven't the men to charge in after them, and Raegar's too busy fantasizing about defeating the irons to be of much help. It falls to you, <name>. Any of the irons or their servants could be carrying the keys to the cages holding our men.Give it a Name^72^Horde^Howling Fjord^Chief Plaguebringer Harris^Tobias Sarkhoff^Give it a Name^^^Show the Blight Specimen to Tobias Sarkhoff at New Agamand.^My, my, how long has it been? How long have we been working on this damned plague? Finally, after an eternity of failure, we are blessed with perfection. This... It doesn't even have a proper name yet! This blight... That's it, BLIGHT! This blight will tear down the very fabric of life! <Harris hands you a vial.> Now, find the bat handler, Tobias, and show him the specimen. He'll get you on your way to Venomspite.To Venomspite!^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Tobias Sarkhoff^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Give it a Name^^^Deliver the Blight Specimen to Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in eastern Dragonblight.^I got a special bat all lined up for you, buddy. Fastest and smoothest ride I've got. He'll take you right to Venomspite - in style. Just hand that vial over to Chief Plaguebringer Middleton once you land.Looking the Part^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Mountaineer Kilian^Mountaineer Kilian^Looking the Part^The Captive Prospectors^^Bring an Overseer's Uniform to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.^If, as Prospector Varana said, only certain irons are permitted to communicate with this Loken, it'll probably be the overseers who have the privilege. We have to get you in there to see what all this is about, but it won't be easy. The first step will be to get a proper uniform for you. Then, we'll worry about doing your makeup. Find one of the overseers at Dun Argol, kill him, and bring back his uniform. If you get blood on it, you'll have only yourself to blame.Cultivating an Image^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Mountaineer Kilian^Mountaineer Kilian^Looking the Part^^^Use Kilian's Camera to record the images of 8 Iron Dwarves in Dun Argol, then return to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.^Now that we've got the uniform, we've got to get enough information to complete your camouflage. Raegar brought along this camera to document the team's finds, but I have a different use in mind. I want you to take it with you to Dun Argol and use it to capture the images of iron dwarves. Of course, your models aren't going to be a cooperative lot, so you may have to, err... subdue them first. Bring back the camera and the images when you're done.Put on Your Best Face for Loken^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Mountaineer Kilian^Mountaineer Kilian^Looking the Part^^^Disguise yourself as an Iron Rune Overseer, intercept the message from Loken, then report to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.^Using the images you've captured, I've created everything you need for your overseer disguise kit. You'll make a fine iron dwarf, if I do say so myself. Take the kit with you to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city. There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.The Forsaken Blight and You: How Not to Die^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Give it a Name^^^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to bring him 10 Ectoplasmic Residue.^The details behind the functionality of the blight are hardly important. All you need to know is that it does the job it was designed to do. I have managed to synthesize a strain of the blight that is inert. <Middleton uncorks a vial and inhales.> See, my body is still, mostly, intact. Now mix this with a reactive agent and we'd all be turned to shapeless piles of goo. On the beach south of here you will find pathetic specters of Alliance soldiers past. Slay them and bring me ectoplasmic residue.Imbeciles Abound!^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Doctor Sintar Malefious^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Imbeciles Abound!^^^Travel to Venomspite in Dragonblight and speak with Chief Plaguebringer Middleton.^The shipment from New Agamand was to arrive at Venomspite last week and then be delivered to me after some simple field tests. It is a Horde imperative - the last piece of the "victory puzzle." <Sintar sighs.> It is quite disheartening to know that you are surrounded by imbeciles and incompetent boobs! You must travel to Venomspite, near the eastern border of Dragonblight. Find that buffoon, Middleton, and let him know that I am waiting on the package.Say Hello to My Little Friend^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Prigmon^Harkor^Shimmercap Stew^^^Prigmon wants you to bring Harkor's Ingredients to Harkor at Harkor's Camp.^Harkor's gunna drop a gold brick when he sees these choice ingredients. All that be left is gettin' them to him. He's camped out on the eastern coast near dem haunted ruins - Drakil'jin, dey be called. You'll likely be makin' it there before I can finish up with these corpses... unless, ya think you'd rather try your hand at embalming?The Unexpected 'Guest'^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Tormak the Scarred^Tormak the Scarred^The Unexpected 'Guest'^^From the Ground Up^Bring 5 Mature Stag Horns to Tormak the Scarred at Camp Oneqwah.^A recent hunting expedition brought back more than just game. They encountered a wounded dwarf fleeing the iron dwarf stronghold of Dun Argol. He may have information we can use to strike at our ancient enemy, but before he's of any use to us, we must bring down his fever. The horns of the silvercoat stags, who roam the nearby forest, have long been used to make healing poultices. If you can bring enough of the horns to me, we'll see if the poultice can bring our 'guest' around.From the Ground Up^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Prospector Rokar^Prospector Rokar^The Unexpected 'Guest'^The Unexpected 'Guest'^^Bring 8 War Golem Parts to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.^We don't have enough time for me to forge the parts myself, but the foundries over at Dun Argol, to the southeast, are working day and night to churn out golem parts. I think you should go back there and pick up enough of them for me to make a golem from this blueprint. They're probably scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working. Please hurry, <name>. That Tormak looks like he's just waiting for an excuse to carry out his threat!We Have the Power^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Prospector Rokar^Prospector Rokar^The Unexpected 'Guest'^^^Bring Durar's Power Cell and Kathorn's Power Cell to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.^Well, we've got the shell of a golem, but that's not good enough for Tormak. He doesn't realize that these things don't just come together and miraculously start working! We're going to need power cells to animate it. When I was in Dun Argol, I noticed that Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem. You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.... Or Maybe We Don't^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Prospector Rokar^Prospector Rokar^The Unexpected 'Guest'^^^Charge your War Golem with the energy from 10 Lightning Sentries and return to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.^The golem's cells have just enough power to run it at the lowest levels, but it can't power any of its combat systems. The good news is that the perimeter of Dun Argol is patrolled by lightning sentries. We should be able to use their power to charge up the golem's weapon systems. Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, it will absorb the power as the sentries die.Bringing Down the Iron Thane^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Prospector Rokar^Tormak the Scarred^The Unexpected 'Guest'^^^Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to Tormak the Scarred at Camp Oneqwah.^Now that the golem is fully charged, it can be used against the leader at Dun Argol. When I observed Iron Thane Furyhammer, he was always guarded by a personal golem that shielded him from all harm. That construct called The Anvil, can be disrupted, causing him to drop the shield. Use your golem's EMP ability to do just that. You'll be able to activate and take control of your golem inside Dun Argol. The thane is in the main plant at the top and supervises production from the bottom level.Emerald Dragon Tears^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Give it a Name^^^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to collect 8 Emerald Dragon Tears.^With an inert specimen of the blight compound complete and the activating agent in hand there only remains a need for a suitable shell to house the components. Southwest of here, on the shores of central Dragonblight, is where you will find the Emerald Dragonshrine. Within the shrine you will find the hardened remnants of a green dragon's tear drop. I don't know the whole story, but apparently they cry a lot right before they die. Go figure. Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and gather tears.The Overseer's Shadow^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Scout Vor'takh^The Runic Prophecies^^^Bring an Overseer's Uniform to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.^It sounds like this Loken is the mastermind behind the sudden preparations for war on the part of the iron dwarves. Only the highest ranking irons are likely to have access to him, so we'll have to make you into an overseer to find out what's going on in there. I have a plan, for that, but we'll need some supplies. Find one of the iron rune overseers at Dun Argol, to the southeast, kill him, and bring back his uniform.Cultivating an Image^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Scout Vor'takh^The Runic Prophecies^^^Use Rokar's Camera to record the images of 8 Iron Dwarves in Dun Argol, then return to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.^Now we have to finish the job of making you as repulsive as those iron dwarves. The best way to do that is to base your disguise on the ugly mugs of real iron dwarves. When Tormak's hunting party discovered that wayward prospector, they took the camera he carried. Now, I suppose, we'll get the chance to use it. Take it with you to Dun Argol, kill some iron dwarves, and record their likenesses in this device. Bring it back once you have enough examples.Loken's Orders^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Scout Vor'takh^The Runic Prophecies^^^Disguise yourself as an Iron Rune Overseer, intercept the message from Loken, then report to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.^I've created everything else you'll need for your overseer disguise kit. Try not to retch when you put it on. I took pains to make it as true to reality as possible. Take the kit with you southeast to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city. There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.In the Name of Loken^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Scout Vor'takh^The Runic Prophecies^The Runic Prophecies, Pounding the Iron^^Speak with Hugh Glass and Gavrock about Loken, then report your findings to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqeah.^The iron dwarves stand as one of the fiercest and most coordinated foes in Northrend. Wherever we have traveled, they have battled us with the name of Loken on their lips. We must learn who this Loken is and what he seeks. The locals may be of help. To the northeast, at the Redwood Trading Post, a human named Hugh Glass peddles his wares. Further east, at the Ruins of Tethys, you'll find a stone giant named Gavrock. Ask them about this Loken. They've got to know something of use.Wanted: The Scarlet Onslaught^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Wanted Poster^High Executor Wroth^^^^Kill 20 members of the Scarlet Onslaught and report to High Executor Wroth at Venomspite.^By order of High Executor Wroth all members of the illegal organization known as the Scarlet Onslaught are to be put to death immediately. No quarter is to be offered, and those proceeding to action upon this decree should be aware that any who are captured by the humans will be left to die, or worse! In the High Executor's words, "Paint the snow red with their blood!"Blighted Last Rites^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Apothecary Vicky Levine^Apothecary Vicky Levine^^^^Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to test the Flask of Blight upon the Scarlet Onslaught Prisoner.^Have you read the wanted poster? What is the high executor thinking?! <Vicky looks around and continues in hushed tones.> We can't very well have those Scarlet Onslaught idiots being raised by their priests, or worse, rising as the Scourge, now can we? No, I'm in total agreement with you, we have to do something about the corpses. I have just the thing. Take this blight that we just created and test it on the prisoner in the cage right here. No muss, no fuss, no returning enemies.Vordrassil's Fall^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^^Attack on Silverbrook^^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to go to Vordrassil's Limb, Vordrassil's Heart or Vordrassil's Tears and obtain 6 Slime Samples from the Entropic Oozes.^Long ago, powerful druids planted a tree to the northeast of here. It was called Vordrassil and it was to be a world tree. It is not known why, but after the tree was fully grown, the druids decided it needed to be destroyed. Ever since we arrived here, the earth has spoken to me, <name>. Its cries of pain come from the places where Vordrassil's remains fell on the ground. Corrupting ooze roams those places. Bring me samples of it so we may begin to heal the land.Good Troll Hunting^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Thurkin^Samir^Good Troll Hunting^^^Sergeant Thurkin told you to speak to Samir at Granite Springs.^Good for nothing wretches! They could have had it easy. We extended our hand in peace. All they had to do was give us passage through Drak'Tharon and we'd have let them be. But no, the prideful little ice trolls decided that they wanted it rough. Now they'll be destroyed and we'll pass through their precious keep to Zul'Drak anyway. We've contracted a gang to deliver us captured trolls. Talk to Samir if you want in on the action. You can find him to the northwest of here, due south of Zeb'Halek.Materiel Plunder^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Quartermaster Bartlett^Quartermaster Bartlett^^^^Quartermaster Bartlett at Venomspite has asked you to steal 8 Scarlet Onslaught Armor and 8 Scarlet Onslaught Weapons.^Ah good, new meat. Do you wish to prove yourself, new meat? The Scarlet Onslaught, the most zealous and racist of the Scarlet Crusade, are in our backyard to the south. If we're going to fight them, we'll need more armor and weapons than I can make in such a short time. Why don't we take theirs? More to the point, why don't YOU take theirs?Troll Season!^73^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Dumont^Samir^Troll Season!^^^Lieutenant Dumont at Amberpine Lodge wants you to speak to Samir at Granite Springs.^You, <race>! No sense standing around here when there's work to be done! Drak'Theron Keep is the most direct route to Zul'Drak. We MUST capture it to ensure safe passage for the Alliance. But until we get the numbers to make an assault, we'll have to content ourselves in thinning out the ice trolls and collecting intel. To that end, we've conscripted a gang of thugs to capture and deliver live trolls for interrogation. Travel northwest and speak with Samir at Granite Springs. He'll direct you further.Let Them Not Rise!^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Apothecary Vicky Levine^Apothecary Vicky Levine^^^^Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use her Container of Rats to pick clean the corpses of 15 Scarlet Onslaught members at New Hearthglen.^I don't understand it. The blight should have worked! No sense worrying about it now. <The apothecary seems relieved for some reason.> Though it doesn't work on the Onslaught for some strange reason, we still need to keep their priests from raising them. I have another idea, one that their corpses shouldn't have any protection from. <name>, take a container of my rats and unleash them upon any Onslaught corpses you come across at New Hearthglen. I starve the vermin, so they should be voracious!Replenishing the Storehouse^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Replenishing the Storehouse^^^Master Woodsman Anderhol at Amberpine Lodge wants you to kill Tallhorn Stag and collect 8 Succulent Venison.^G'day, <class>. The good lieutenant here says that there's been a Horde raid on our storehouse that's left our food supply dangerously low. No doubt we'll make those cretins pay, but first we need to focus our attention on restocking. My men are doing all they can, but we're going to need every able body to contribute if we're to avert a crisis. You should have no trouble harvesting venison from the local stag in these parts. Happy hunting!The Darkness Beneath^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^^Attack on Silverbrook^^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to go to Vordrassil's Heart, Vordrassil's Tears and Vordrassil's Limb and use the Geomancer's Orb in the depths beneath the surface.^Something... dark... happened to the tree Vordrassil. After the druids decided to destroy it, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground. I want you to go to the three locations to the northeast where the tree's trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can. Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area. This might shed some light on what happened to Vordrassil and why it failed to become a world tree.Fresh Remounts^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Hansel Bauer^Hansel Bauer^^^^Hansel Bauer at Venomspite has asked you to steal 3 Onslaught Warhorses and deliver them to him, handing over the reins when you do so.^Hello. I am Hansel. Pleased to meet you, <sir /ma'am>. The high executor came to me and said, 'Hansel, I want you to get us new mounts.' Where does he think dreadsteeds come from? The ground? Actually, they do if you can find a horse graveyard. But we don't have one of those, so what we need you to do is go south to New Hearthglen, kill the knights, take their riding crops, and steal their warhorses. Ride the horse back to me here and hand over the reins, if you would.Them or Us!^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Them or Us!^^^Anderhol at Amberpine Lodge wants you to find and kill 6 Graymist Hunters in Grizzly Hills.^As if we didn't have enough to concern ourselves with.... With the present food crisis, we find ourselves competing for food with the local worgs. The situation is becoming more dire, and I fear that if we don't address the issue immediately we'll soon find ourselves with nothing to hunt. Scour the forest, <race>. Kill any graymist you find. Recent reports have sighted a concentration of them on the other side of the river west of here.Take Their Rear!^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Replenishing the Storehouse^^^Anderhol at Amberpine Lodge wants you to collect 8 Grizzly Flanks from the Grizzly Bears in Grizzly Hills.^We've all been working hard and it's beginning to pay off, but we're still far from our goal. We need much more meat than we have and it's growing clear that the local stag population won't be enough by itself. I'm afraid we need you to turn your attention to more dangerous prey - the grizzlies that give this region its name. They're plentiful, and they're well fed from the abundant fish that swim in these streams. Be safe, <class>!Eagle Eyes^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Them or Us!^^^Anderhol in Amberpine Lodge wants you to kill 5 Imperial Eagles and then report back to him.^Well, <name>, we've determined how the Horde was able to locate our hidden stores of food. It turns out that they were binding their sight to the unsuspecting eagles that soar above the trees here. Using eagle vision, they were able to effectively spy on our every action. By order of the lieutenant, we've got to hunt down these majestic birds in order to thwart our enemy.Spread the Good Word^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Give it a Name^^^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to use the Forsaken Blight Spreader's Blight Bomb to destroy 30 Hungering Dead on the outskirts of the Carrion Fields.^Before I can ship you off to Doctor Malefious with the good news, you will have to run a simple field test of the blight with the modifications I have made. The hungering dead stream out from what remains of Old Wintergarde. Commandeer a vehicle from the east gate and drive it northeast through Vengeance Pass until you reach the twin towers at the southeastern edge of Wintergarde. Drop the blight bomb on the undead that cover the area. Report back to me with the results!The Failed World Tree^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^^A Swift Response^Children of Ursoc^Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Vordrassil's Limb, Vordrassil's Heart or Vordrassil's Tears and obtain 6 Slime Samples from the Entropic Oozes.^My ancestors once planted a tree in the middle of the Grizzly Hills. It was called Vordrassil and it was to become a world tree. For reasons long forgotten, after the tree was fully grown, they decided it needed to be destroyed. Its giant trunk splintered at three locations in the area to the north. Where the tree touched the ground, foul ooze began to crawl the earth. Bring me slime samples so I can begin my work and the earth can be healed.A Dark Influence^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^^A Swift Response^A Possible Link^Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Vordrassil's Heart, Vordrassil's Tears and Vordrassil's Limb and use the Geomancer's Orb in the depths beneath the surface.^When the tree Vordrassil fell, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground. I want you to go north of here to the three locations where the trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can. You'll find them west of Grizzlemaw. Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area. If we're to heal the land, we must first find out what caused Vordrassil to fail as a world tree all those years ago.The Forsaken Blight^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Chief Plaguebringer Middleton^Doctor Sintar Malefious^Give it a Name^^The Kor'kron Vanguard!^Deliver The Forsaken Blight to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer.^I have prepared a package that must be delivered to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer. The contents of the package include the final blight specimen along with instructions on preparation and samples of the reactive agent. You will find Agmar's Hammer in western Dragonblight. Just look for the black, jagged metal orc buildings - that will be Agmar's Hammer.Secrets of the Flamebinders^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Woodsman Drake^Woodsman Drake^Secrets of the Flamebinders^A Tentative Pact^Mmm... Amberseeds!^Bring 3 Flame-Imbued Talismans to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.^Even as we attempt to fight off the Horde, the Dragonflayer tribe musters in their village of Voldrune, near the coast to the south. The most powerful warriors in the village are granted flame-imbued talismans that give them the ability to control powerful, savage proto-drakes. If we can gain control of one of these drakes, perhaps we can use it to neutralize the threat posed by Voldrune. The Dragonflayer flamebinders create the talismans and imbue them with power. Kill them and take the talismans.Thinning the Ranks^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Woodsman Drake^Woodsman Drake^Thinning the Ranks^A Tentative Pact^Mmm... Amberseeds!^Kill 12 Dragonflayer Huscarls and return to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.^There's a flurry of activity down in Voldrune village to the south. Thane Torvald Eriksson and his huscarls are preparing for war. With most of our men in the field dealing with the Horde's treachery, Amberpine will be vulnerable. Travel to Voldrune, which is near the southern coast, and show those Dragonflayers we're no soft target. Slay as many of the huscarls as you can find. Make them think twice about taking advantage of our conflict with the Horde.The Kor'kron Vanguard!^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Overlord Agmar^Saurfang the Younger^The Kor'kron Vanguard!^Agmar's Hammer, Blightbeasts be Damned!, All Hail Roanauk!, The Forsaken Blight^^Report to Saurfang the Younger at the Kor'kron Vanguard.^You have done well, <brother/sister>. All that you have faced, you have done as a champion of the Horde. The Scourged Anub'ar of Azjol-Nerub, crushed under your foot! The taunka, brave and powerful new members of the Horde, because of you! Our super-weapon against the Scourge, tested and perfected by you! The time has come, the moment is now - our elite soldiers at the Wrathgate need you. The son of Saurfang awaits your arrival at the Kor'kron Vanguard. Go now, northeast to the Wrathgate.Mmm... Amberseeds!^73^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Amberseed^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Mmm... Amberseeds!^Secrets of the Flamebinders, Thinning the Ranks^^Speak with Master Woodsman Anderhol in Amberpine Lodge.^Your stomach growls as the pungent smell of hearty nuts draws your attention to the the bucket of seeds. Some thoughtful soul has obviously left these complimentary morsels here to rejuvenate weary visitors. Grateful, you take the remaining few and devour them. The seeds do not disappoint. Finding yourself hungry for more, you set out to discover their origins....Just Passing Through^73^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Mmm... Amberseeds!^^^Anderhol at Amberpine Lodge wants you to bring him 5 Blackroot Stalks.^We must act quickly, <race>! We can't risk letting those precious seeds become fully digested. They need to come out, NOW. Forage up some blackroot from the riverbank just west of here and I'll make you a purgative that should get things moving. Hurry now! And remember, you brought this upon yourself....Doing Your Duty^73^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Master Woodsman Anderhol^Mmm... Amberseeds!^^^Anderhol in Amberpine Lodge wants you to take the Anderhol's Slider Cider and use the nearby outhouse to retrieve the Partially Processed Amberseeds.^Alright, <race>. Here's the juice. It works immediately, so don't use it until you're safely inside the outhouse. Now go get me those seeds!A Possible Link^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^^^^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to obtain 8 Crazed Furbolg Blood from the Furbolgs at Heart's Blood Shrine and Rage Fang Shrine.^Not long ago we sent an expedition to the east, where it was attacked by crazed furbolgs. One of the survivors described slaying one of them and its body expelling a dark slimy substance. For thousands of years, the furbolgs in this region have been peaceful. It is possible that there is a link to the furbolgs' behavior and the dark energy we were able to detect earlier. Bring me samples of the furbolgs' blood. You will find them to the east in the Rage Fang Shrine and the Heart's Blood Shrine.Stealing from the Siegesmiths^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Deathguard Molder^Deathguard Molder^Stealing from the Siegesmiths^^^Deathguard Molder at Venomspite has asked you to retrieve 6 Siegesmith Bombs.^I'm tasked with the destruction of the Scarlet Onslaught's ballistae. Unfortunately, the apothecaries and I are at odds on the use of our resources, so I've nothing to destroy them with! To the northeast are the Carrion Fields. The Scourge siegesmiths there at their forge and meat wagons are demolition masters. Luckily for us, they also leave their bombs lying about. I want you to retrieve them for me, off of the ground or the siegesmiths, I don't care which.The Bear God's Offspring^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^^^^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to speak to Orsonn at the Ragefang Shrine and Kodian at the Heart's Blood Shrine.^It is possible that the furbolg of Grizzly Hills have the same taint that plagued Vordrassil. They've been involved in a deadly tribal war recently after years of peaceful coexistence. The shrines that they guard to the east are home to Ursoc's offspring. If the corruption has affected the furbolg, it is possible that because of their lineage, Kodian and Orsonn have remained unharmed. If that's the case, find them and listen to what they have to say.Bombard the Ballistae^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Deathguard Molder^Deathguard Molder^Stealing from the Siegesmiths^^^Deathguard Molder at Venomspite has asked you to use the Siegesmith Bombs to bombard 5 New Hearthglen Ballistae.^At last, our chance to strike at their siege engines! Don't flub it. I kid. A little. <class>, bombard New Hearthglen's ballistae with these bombs. We'll show the Royal Apothecary Society how it's done old style. No concoctions required!Need to Know^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Spy Mistress Repine^Spy Mistress Repine^Need to Know^^^Spy Mistress Repine at Venomspite has asked you to steal the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Abbey, Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Barracks, and Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders: Beach.^I need to know what New Hearthglen is up to. I want you to steal their orders of the day so that I can find that out. Head south and in their abbey, in their barracks, and on their beach, find those daily plans! Just in case you're confused, the barracks is the large building right next to the smithy.Naxxramas and the Fall of Wintergarde^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Gryphon Commander Urik^The Lost Courier^^^Speak with Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station in Wintergarde Keep.^Lord Fordragon has led a crushing assault against Arthas at the Wrathgate. In response to this affront, Arthas has sent Naxxramas down upon us. While Kel'Thuzad hides in the floating citadel, his ground commander, Thel'zan, lays siege to Wintergarde Keep. The lower village is already lost and any chance of extracting survivors from the ruins diminishes by the minute. We must act quickly! Report to Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station at once! He'll get you up to speed. Leave me!Ursoc, the Bear God^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^Destroy the Sapling^Destroy the Sapling, Vordrassil's Seeds^^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to find Tur Ragepaw near Ursoc's Den and defeat Ursoc with his help. Use the Purified Ashes of Vordrassil on Ursoc's Corpse when you've accomplished this.^The time has come, <name>. Now we will learn whether our efforts will accomplish what we need or nothing at all. Take these ashes and seek the furbolg that Kodian told you about, Tur Ragepaw, near Ursoc's Den. You will find the den to the north of Grizzlemaw. Convince Tur to aid you, for you will need all the help you can get. Once you've defeated the bear god, use these ashes over his body. Even if his worldly form is destroyed, his spirit must be saved.Flight of the Wintergarde Defender^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Gryphon Commander Urik^Gryphon Commander Urik^The Lost Courier^^^Rescue 10 Helpless Wintergarde Villagers and return to Gryphon Commander Urik at Wintergarde Keep.^With this whistle you can call down a Wintergarde gryphon. Mount the creature and head towards the ruins of Wintergarde Village, now known as the Carrion Fields, southeast of here. Once at the fields, keep your eyes peeled for helpless Wintergarde villagers. When you spot one, fly low and use the gryphon to pick them up. Return the rescued villager here, to the gryphon station. There are Scourge all over the place so you'll need to keep your wits about you, hero. Good luck!Cleansing Drak'Tharon^75^All^Drak'Tharon Keep^Image of Drakuru^Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^Darkness Calling, Reunited^Drakuru wants you to use Drakuru's Elixir at his brazier inside Drak'Tharon. Using Drakuru's Elixir there will require 5 Enduring Mojo.^The time be here at last, good friend. Drak'Tharon soon be cleansed of them foul undead and restored to her noble purpose. My soul will be havin' peace, and in return for your help, the keep's most valuable treasures be yours, mon! Da keep rises up into a sacred ziggurat. Once ya be reachin' its top, ya must summon me a final time, and I'll perform the ritual. Alas, mon, my summonin' will again be comin' at a cost. Ya must collect the mojo from the survivors in the keep,The Spy in New Hearthglen^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Spy Mistress Repine^Agent Skully^Need to Know^^^Deliver the Scarlet Onslaught Daily Orders to Agent Skully at New Hearthglen.^I have a spy within the ranks of the Scarlet Onslaught. I need you to deliver these daily orders to her so that she can plan the next phase of our assault. She goes by the name of Agent Skully and she's under a magical guise to appear as the Onslaught's cemetery caretaker. Here, take these orders to her, and then do as she asks. You'll find the graveyard on the side of the abbey.A Means to an End^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Apothecary Vicky Levine^Apothecary Vicky Levine^A Means to an End^^^Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use the Levine Family Termites to lure Foreman Kaleiki out and kill him.^I received a few barrels of termites from my sister at the Bulwark back home in the last shipment. I think they're going to come in handy for something I have in mind for you. The lumbermill operations at New Hearthglen are problematic for us, but so far we haven't been able to get anyone in there to take out their foreman. I think that if you were to unleash these termites on his precious woodworks, he'd be sure to come running. Ready to take him out, <class>?Destroy the Sapling^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^Destroy the Sapling^^Ursoc, the Bear God^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to take the Verdant Torch and use it to burn Vordrassil's Sapling. Bring Vordrassil's Ashes back to Windseer Grayhorn.^The furbolgs' work must be undone, <name>. The best of intentions do not count for much when the result is tainted by such strong a corruption. The sapling must be destroyed, for it is the source of this dark influence. Take this torch and use it to set fire to the corrupted sapling and bring me its ashes. Once cleansed, by fire, I will use what power I can to remove the taint from them. You will need the ashes to purify Ursoc from the evil power that holds sway over him.Vordrassil's Seeds^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^Vordrassil's Seeds^^Ursoc, the Bear God^Windseer Grayhorn in Conquest Hold wants you to go to Grizzlemaw and obtain 8 of Vordrassil's Seeds.^We must make sure that Vordrassil is never regrown. The furbolg must have harvested its seed. Go to Grizzlemaw, in central Grizzly Hills, and obtain all the seeds that you can find. I will make sure they're properly destroyed.Fire Upon the Waters^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Apothecary Vicky Levine^Apothecary Vicky Levine^A Means to an End^^^Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use her Apothecary's Burning Water to set the sails of the Sinner's Folly afire.^I have another mission for you. I was able to repurpose some of the blight to concoct my world-famous burning water. I want you to take it and set the sails of the Sinner's Folly ablaze! Use it from the dock. Once the sails are on fire, the deckhands will be busy putting them out, and you'll slip belowdecks to 'retrieve' the captain's rutters. You'll find the ship on Crusader's Landing, below and south of New Hearthglen. Look for the captain's quarters on the first lower deck, behind the stairs.Shredder Repair^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Synipus^Synipus^^^^Synipus at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to bring 3 Broken-down Shredders back to him.^Listen, pal. Why don't ya roll up your sleeves and grab a wrench? There's work to be done! They need these shredders refurbished and sent down to Venture Bay, and they need it done yesterday.... No wrench? Well what good are ya then? May as well go down with the rest of the lugheads and play with the Horde! While you're there, see if you can drive some of those broken-down shredders up here for repairs. Be careful! They're in pretty bad shape.No Mercy for the Captured^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Spy Mistress Repine^High Executor Wroth^No Mercy for the Captured^^^Spy Mistress Repine has asked you to slay Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Barriga, Engineer Burke, and Chancellor Amai.^We have more fools for you to kill. My agents tell me that several of our good citizens have seen fit to fall into the hands of the Scarlet Onslaught. This will not do. Go back to New Hearthglen and eliminate Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Barriga, Engineer Burke and Chancellor Amai. From what I hear, they're spread out throughout the area. No doubt they are being kept in cages awaiting torture. Speak with them and then kill them!A Possible Link^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^^A Dark Influence^Vordrassil's Sapling^Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to obtain 8 Crazed Furbolg Blood from the Furbolgs at Heart's Blood Shrine and Rage Fang Shrine.^The furbolgs that live east of here are more aggressive and bestial than the ones we're used to. Our forces have squared off with them more than once, and the survivors always speak of a dark, slimy substance dripping from their corpses. Their condition could be linked with the contaminants we found on Vordrassil's remains. Bring me samples of the furbolgs' blood. You will find them in the Rage Fang Shrine and the Heart's Blood Shrine, far to the east.Children of Ursoc^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^^The Failed World Tree^Vordrassil's Seeds^Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to speak to Orsonn at the Rage Fang Shrine and Kodian at the Heart's Blood Shrine.^The furbolgs of Grizzly Hills carry with them a corruption of some kind, that is for sure. Tribal war has broken out amongst them after years of peaceful coexistence. What remains to be seen is whether the bears they worship as gods have also been tainted. Ursoc's two children, Orsonn and Kodian, dwell in the Heart's Blood Shrine and the Rage Fang Shrine, south and southeast of Grizzlemaw. See if they will speak to you regarding what has happened here.Vordrassil's Sapling^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^Vordrassil's Sapling^A Possible Link^Ursoc, the Bear God^Hierophant Thayreen in Amberpine Lodge wants you to take the Verdant Torch and use it to burn Vordrassil's Sapling. Bring Vordrassil's Ashes back to Hierophant Thayreen.^The druids of old seem to have had good reasons for destroying Vordrassil. We cannot let the furbolgs regrow it. On the other hand, saving Ursoc's spirit hinges on the magic contained by the sapling. Take this torch and use it to burn the tree. You will find it in the middle of Grizzlemaw, inside Vordrassil's old trunk. Bring me Vordrassil's ashes. It is my hope that once purified by fire, we may use its magic to cleanse Ursoc's spirit of its dark taint.Ursoc, the Bear God^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^Vordrassil's Sapling^Vordrassil's Sapling, Vordrassil's Seeds^^Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to find Tur Ragepaw near Ursoc's Den and defeat Ursoc with his help. Use the Purified Ashes of Vordrassil on Ursoc's Corpse when you've accomplished this.^It is time, <name>. Take these ashes and look for the furbolg that Kodian spoke of. If he went to seek Ursoc, he will be near his den, north of Grizzlemaw. You will need his help. You won't be able to defeat Ursoc alone. Once you've defeated Ursoc, use these ashes to purify his spirit. Only then will we know whether our efforts have been in vain or not.Vordrassil's Seeds^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Hierophant Thayreen^Hierophant Thayreen^Vordrassil's Seeds^Children of Ursoc^Ursoc, the Bear God^Hierophant Thayreen at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Grizzlemaw and obtain 8 of Vordrassil's Seeds.^We cannot allow Vordrassil to grow again. If the furbolg regrew it once, they can do it again. Go to Grizzlemaw, in central Grizzly Hills, and obtain Vordrassil's seeds. I will make sure they're properly disposed of.Return to the High Commander^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Gryphon Commander Urik^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^The Lost Courier^^Not In Our Mine, The Bleeding Ore, The Demo-gnome, Imprints on the Past, Wanted: Kreug Oathbreaker, Wanted: High Shaman Bloodpaw, Wanted: Onslaught Commander Iustus, My Old Enemy^Speak with High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^Return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at once, <name>. Let him know that your mission was a success and that the few remaining villagers that were rescued are back to work.Torture the Torturer^72^Horde^Dragonblight^High Executor Wroth^High Executor Wroth^No Mercy for the Captured^^^High Executor Wroth at Venomspite wants you to use the branding iron 5 times on Torturer LeCraft to get the information out of him. After that, kill him.^Enough! I want you to put an end to the torture of my people! The Onslaught's torturer, LeCraft, has been bleeding information out of everyone that gets caught by those fiends! I need to know what they know. My sources tell me that he has set up shop in the basement of their barracks, which is right next to the smithy. I'll loan you my personal branding iron to see to it that the job is done right. Find him and get that information.Rescue from Town Square^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^The Lost Courier^^^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to rescue 6 Trapped Wintergarde Villagers.^Just down this path here is Wintergarde's town square. Once a hive of activity for the citizens of Wintergarde, now a warzone, filled with murderous geists hell-bent on vengeance towards the living. In the buildings surrounding the town square are trapped villagers that must be rescued! I ask much of you, now, <name>, but you are the only soldier I can spare. Free our people. Take this path down into town square and enter those houses. Kill anything that gets in your way! Return to me should you survive.Without a Prayer^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Agent Skully^Agent Skully^Need to Know^^^Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you to acquire Bishop Street's Prayer Book.^These plans indicate something imminent is being planned. But first, there's the matter of this strange protection that the Onslaught forces have. If Venomspite is to deal with them once and for all, we must find out who's behind it and eliminate them. I've noticed that the bishop in the chapel on the far side of New Hearthglen, across from the lumbermill, has stepped up his blessing of the troops. Kill him and steal his prayer book. Maybe it will give us a clue.The Thane of Voldrune^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Woodsman Drake^Woodsman Drake^Secrets of the Flamebinders^^^Use Flamebringer to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.^Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened Voldrune's defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson. The thane's favorite mount is an unruly proto-drake he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane. Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy.The Flamebinders' Secrets^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Nazgrim^Sergeant Nazgrim^The Flamebinders' Secrets^^The Thane of Voldrune^Bring 3 Flame-Imbued Talismans to Sergeant Nazgrim at Conquest Hold.^Even as the Alliance cowards attack our positions, the Dragonflayer vrykul outpost of Voldrune, to the southeast, prepares for war. The vrykul are far from the strongest enemy we face here, but we must eliminate them before they can truly threaten us. Their most powerful warriors are permitted to ride half-trained proto-drakes into battle. To control the beasts, their flamebinders create powerful talismans. You'll need to slay them and take the talismans if our plan is to work.A Show of Strength^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Nazgrim^Sergeant Nazgrim^The High Executor Needs You^^The Thane of Voldrune^Kill 12 Dragonflayer Huscarls and return to Sergeant Nazgrim at Conquest Hold.^Preparations for war are underway in the vrykul village of Voldrune to the southeast. Voldrune's thane cannot field a large army, but with our forces spread thin, we are still at risk. We cannot risk giving the thane and his men an opportunity to attack, so we must take the battle to them. If you are truly a <class> of the Horde, you will relish the chance to demonstrate our strength. Cut down the huscarls and prove to this Dragonflayer clan that the Horde is not to be trifled with!The Fate of the Dead^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Commander Lynore Windstryke^Commander Lynore Windstryke^^^^Commander Lynore Windstryke at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to kill 15 Vengeful Geists.^The town square, down this path, is overrun with the undead citizens of Wintergarde! Our own crypt provides a seemingly endless supply of soldiers for the Scourge to throw at us. Take no pity on them, though, <name>. While they were once mortal, capable of compassion and thought, they are now ravaging undead with only one purpose: our destruction. Venture forth to the town square and deliver the vengeful geists to their maker. Give them peace.The Thane of Voldrune^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Nazgrim^Sergeant Nazgrim^The Flamebinders' Secrets^The Flamebinders' Secrets, A Show of Strength^^Use Flamebringer to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to Sergeant Nazgrim at Conquest Hold.^With the flame-imbued talismans, we can finally challenge the thane. His favorite mount is a ferocious proto-drake called Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the power of the talismans, you should be able to bend it to your will and use it against the thane. Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and use Flamebringer to destroy him.The Perfect Dissemblance^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Agent Skully^Agent Skully^Need to Know^^^Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you steal the image of a Onslaught Raven Priest. Return the Banshee's Magic Mirror to her when you have done so.^You may wonder how I can maintain this guise; I use a magic mirror that was loaned to me by the spy mistress. It only has so much power in it, but I think there's enough for the both of us. Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught raven priests. Be quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror. Realize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you.No Place to Run^74^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Serinar^No Place to Run^The Obsidian Dragonshrine^^Place a Destructive Ward at the end of the path leading out of Obsidian Dragonshrine, where the road starts to give way to snow. Protect the ward until it is fully charged, then return to Serinar.^They're drawing power from the bones of my dead brothers... I have no love for the cult, but I'm baffled by their audacity. There will be no mercy shown for them... not that I ever would have anyway. Ensure that they have no place to flee when the slaughter starts. Place a destructive ward at the end of the path leading out of the shrine... where the road starts to give way to snow. Defend it until it is fully charged.No One to Save You^74^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Serinar^^The Obsidian Dragonshrine^^Kill 6 Burning Depths Necrolytes and 10 Smoldering Skeletons outside of the Obsidian Dragonshrine. Return to Serinar once the task is complete.^We will spare no one. Outside, lowly necrolytes and their skeletal servants shame my land with their presence. Slaughter them all.The Best of Intentions^74^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Serinar^No Place to Run^^Culling the Damned, Defiling the Defilers^Wait for Serinar to administer the disguise of a Burning Depths Necrolyte, then proceed to the back of the Maw of Neltharion to uncover what the Cult of the Damned is doing there. Return to Serinar with details regarding their purpose.^The Cult of the Damned has not come just to extract power from dead dragons. I suspect I know what they are up to, but I need you to prove me correct. I will grant you the guise of this dead necrolyte. Proceed to the back of the cave and confirm their intentions for being in this sacred place. I will watch through your eyes. Be cautious <name>, any damage done to you is likely to break the fragile illusion.Culling the Damned^74^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Serinar^^The Best of Intentions^^Kill 3 Burning Depths Necromancers, 6 Smoldering Constructs, and 6 Smoldering Geist in the Maw of Neltharion, and then return to Serinar.^The cave beyond was swarming with Cult atrocities. There is only one way to deal with such creatures... you know what to do.Defiling the Defilers^74^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Serinar^Defiling the Defilers^The Best of Intentions^^Locate and stamp out 8 Necromantic Runes that have been drawn on the floor inside the Maw of Neltharion. Return to Serinar once the task is complete.^I sensed a large accumulation of magic in the runes that we witnessed when you were scouting the cave. I will not have you toy with extracting the magic... often the most straight forward solution is the most effective one. Destroy the runes... stamp them out and ensure that the Cult will not have access to whatever power that they've accumulated there.Tales of Destruction^74^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Nalice^Defiling the Defilers^^^Travel back to Wyrmrest and let Nalice know that Serinar's task is complete.^You can leave now, <race>. Go tell Nalice she missed out on a good slaughter.Neltharion's Flame^75^All^Dragonblight^Serinar^Serinar^Defiling the Defilers^^^Use Neltharion's Flame to douse the summoning area in the back of the Maw of Neltharion. Once you get the attention of Rothin the Decaying, kill him, then return to Serinar at the front of the cave.^With the cult's ranks thinned and some of their power stripped, it's time to strike at the source of the corruption. Rothin the Decaying is resurrecting black dragons as magmawyrms in the back of the cave. Go to the summoning chamber and cleanse the remaining bones in the only way that will ensure that they will never be toyed with again... with flame. Burning the bones will surely gain Rothin's attention, see to it that he is destroyed as well. The magic in this vial should see the task done.Pieces Parts^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Pipthwack^Pipthwack^^^^Pipthwack in Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to collect 4 Grooved Cogs, 3 Notched Sprockets, and 2 High Tension Springs.^Ack! This thing's a mess! Goblin engineering leaves a great deal to be desired, believe you me. Just look at this! It's a wonder it ever worked to begin with. Give me a hand, will ya? To get this even close to operable specifications I'll need to replace a few cogs, sprockets, and springs. You should have no trouble finding them down around the sawmill.Not In Our Mine^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig^Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig^^Return to the High Commander^^Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to recover 10 Wintergarde Miner's Cards.^That blasted necropolis blindsided us! In the wake of its destruction Wintergarde Mine was lost. Worse yet, Kel'Thuzad's acolytes have raised the slain miners as Scourge and are using them to supply their siegesmiths with materials from our mine! The supply line must be halted and our lost brothers must be put to rest. Travel to Wintergarde Mine, northeast of here in the Carrion Fields, and destroy the risen miners. Return to me with their miner cards so that I may put their passing in our registry.Shred the Alliance^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Grekk^Grekk^^^^Grekk at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to acquire 3 shredders and return to him with them.^Read my lips, <class> - I need those shredders! Just as important - I need to keep them out of the hands of the Alliance! They've been refurbishing the shredders and using them against our brothers in Venture Bay. Now we're going to give them a taste of their own medicine! You see a shredder out there, grab it! You see one of the Alliance scum on one, kill 'em and then grab it! Once you have one, drive it back here to me and we'll get to work on it. Dismissed!The Rod of Compulsion^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Torturer's Rod^High Executor Wroth^The Rod of Compulsion^^^Deliver the Torturer's Rod to High Executor Wroth at Venomspite.^A rod drops from LeCraft's dead hand. There are pulsing magical runes along its length. Could this be how he was getting his confessions? Better let the high executor have a look at it.The Bleeding Ore^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Siege Engineer Quarterflash^Siege Engineer Quarterflash^^Return to the High Commander^Understanding the Scourge War Machine^Siege Engineer Quarterflash at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to recover 10 samples of Strange Ore from Wintergarde Mine.^Hours before the Naxxramas invasion, one of the miners stumbled upon a dark ore that was oozing a viscous fluid. In the chaos that occurred during the evacuation of the mine, we lost the samples taken from the alien node. Now the Scourge prospects the ore for use in their machines of death. You must get back to Wintergarde Mine, due northeast of here in the Carrion Fields, and recover the strange ore. It is imperative to our mission's success!The Denouncement^73^Horde^Dragonblight^High Executor Wroth^High Executor Wroth^The Rod of Compulsion^^^High Executor Wroth at Venomspite has tasked you with using the Rod of Compulsion on Commander Jordan, Lead Cannoneer Zierhut, Blacksmith Goodman, and Stable Master Mercer.^It's time for us to utterly demoralize the Onslaught forces! I want you to take the rod and use it on four of their leaders: Commander Jordan upstairs at the barracks, Lead Cannoneer Zierhut down the southeast ramp overlooking the beach, Blacksmith Goodman at the smithy, and Stable Master Mercer at the stables. Place them under the rod's compulsion, concentrate on making them denounce the Onslaught, and then kill them!A Fall From Grace^73^Horde^Dragonblight^Agent Skully^Agent Skully^Need to Know^^^Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you to ring the bell in the abbey and then go speak with the high abbot and get information out of him.^We need more information from the high abbot, and now that we have the visage of one of the raven priests, I think we can get you close to talk with him. Unfortunately, we need to separate him from his bodyguards or you'll never get any information out of him. <The agent leans on her shovel and thinks a moment.> I think I've got it! While in disguise, go to the top of the abbey and ring the bell. That should bring the abbot's bodyguards running and you can then head down to speak with him.The Demo-gnome^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Siege Engineer Quarterflash^The Demo-gnome^Return to the High Commander^^Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^Quarterflash recently requisitioned my group for a specialist that he could send on a reconnaissance mission to the Wintergarde Mine. To that end, I sent him Slinkin, my demolitionist. I foolishly thought that he could close off that pit of damnation after his mission for Quarterflash was complete, securing another victory for us against the Scourge. An entire day has now passed and Slinkin has not returned. I want answers! Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash and track down my missing agent!The Search for Slinkin^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Siege Engineer Quarterflash^Slinkin the Demo-gnome^The Demo-gnome^^^Find Slinkin the Demo-gnome in Wintergarde Mine. Use Quarterflash's Homing Bot if you need help finding the mine.^While I have not heard from Slinkin or know what fate has befallen him, perhaps I can assist in finding him. <Quarterflash holds up a tiny mechanical toy.> This is not a toy, newfound compatriot. It is, in fact, my latest mechanical creation. The machine was created with the sole purpose of finding that which has been lost. These are unfortunate circumstances, but the machine is your best chance at finding Slinkin. When you are ready to begin your search, place the bot on the ground next to me.Leave Nothing to Chance^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Slinkin the Demo-gnome^Siege Engineer Quarterflash^The Demo-gnome^^Understanding the Scourge War Machine^Retrieve a Wintergarde Mine Bomb and use it to blow up the Upper Wintergarde Mine Shaft and the Lower Wintergarde Mine Shaft. Report back to Siege Engineer Quarterflash at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight when you have completed this task.^If there is good in your heart and your conscience is clear, read on. In this mine, near the foreman's scaffold, rests a hefty cargo of dynamite. Go there and pick up several bundles of the explosive and make your way towards the entrance of the mine. Once there, set the dynamite and blow up the entrance. Remember to do this for the upper and lower entry points of Wintergarde Mine. You must leave nothing to chance. The evil that exists here must never be allowed out. Light guide you.A Bear of an Appetite^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Hugh Glass^Hugh Glass^^^^Bring 6 Northern Salmon to Hugh Glass at the Redwood Trading Post.^Thank goodness you're back, Limpy! I worried that Griselda and I were going to be all alone. I'm cooking up some food here for us, but Griselda'll have none of it. She's fond of the fish that live off the coast of the Eastwind Shore, to the east. Can't stand them myself, but she's always been a picky eater. Six good-sized fish ought to keep her happy for a while. Now, run... err... limp along, Joe. Wouldn't want to keep the girl waiting, would ya?Making Repairs^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Lurz^Lurz^^^^Lurz at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to collect 4 Grooved Cogs, 3 Notched Sprockets, and 2 High Tension Springs.^Twenty shredders by noon tomorrow! Who makes these schedules, anyway? No one who ever put one of these garbage cans back together, that's who.... If I'm going to hit my quota, I'll need a hand. Help me out and I'll share my commission with you - fair enough? I need cogs, sprockets and springs. They're littered across the ground down by the shredders.Understanding the Scourge War Machine^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Siege Engineer Quarterflash^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^^The Bleeding Ore, Leave Nothing to Chance^Into Hostile Territory^Deliver Quarterflash's Package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.^We must take solace in the fact that Slinkin's death, while tragic, was for the greater good. His discovery coupled with your heroics in the mine and the samples you returned brings us one step closer to understanding the Scourge war machine. Take this package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. It holds a sample of the strange ore and my analysis.Imprints on the Past^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Zelig the Visionary^Zelig the Visionary^Imprints on the Past^Return to the High Commander^^Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to recover his Scrying Orb.^The memories of the past haunt this land, <name>. I hear the cries of the fallen echo across Northrend - calling to me. Arthas left a terrible imprint on everything he touched. Only wither and decay remains in his wake. It is important, then, for us to study the past so that we may better know our enemy. Perhaps untold truths shall surface that could help in our campaign. First, you must recover my scrying orb from the town hall, <name>. Exit this tower and turn left down the path to reach the town square.The Truth Will Out^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Agent Skully^High Executor Wroth^Need to Know^^^Agent Skully has asked you to acquire The Diary of High General Abbendis and to deliver it to High Executor Wroth at Venomspite.^We have to figure out what's going on here. We need the general's diary! I'm pretty sure that you'll find it on her nightstand upstairs at her house. It's the one next to church, across from the stables and the lumbermill. Once you acquire the diary, take it to the high executor back at Venomspite. You'll have to do this the old-fashioned way; the power of the mirror is low and there's only enough left for me. <The agent smirks.>Keep 'Em on Their Heels^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Commander Bargok^Commander Bargok^^^^Commander Bargok wants you to kill 15 Alliance units or players in Blue Sky Logging Ground.^We've suffered heavy casualties here, <race>. The only good news is that we've given as much as we've taken. I've requested more troops, but the bulk of our forces are bogged down in Venture Bay. It looks like we're on our own for now. No matter how bad it gets, we MUST stand our ground! The precious resources of this region are essential to the Horde's long-term success in Northrend. We've got to keep the Alliance on their heels until help arrives. Get out there and give 'em something to think about.Do Unto Others^73^Horde^Dragonblight^High Executor Wroth^High Executor Wroth^Need to Know^^^High Executor Wroth at Venomspite has ordered you to return with The Head of the High General.^Their attack is imminent, <class>. I need you to get in there and sever the head of the Scarlet Onslaught, literally! It's not going to be easy... Abbendis is sure to be surrounded by a great many of her men. I suggest that you take at least a couple of friends along. Bring back her head and I'll see to it that you're properly rewarded for saving Venomspite. Fail and don't even bother to return!Orik Trueheart and the Forgotten Shore^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Zelig the Visionary^Orik Trueheart^Imprints on the Past^^^Seek out the assistance of Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight.^I have gazed upon the orb and seen the path that you must walk, <name>. Many years ago an atrocity was committed upon the shores of Dragonblight. The act itself remains shrouded in darkness, but I am certain that your destiny lies south, amidst the ruins of the Forgotten Shore. Take the road southeast through the ravaged town square. Follow the trail until you arrive at Dawn's Reach. You will meet an old friend of mine there known as Orik Trueheart. He will be expecting you.Overwhelmed!^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Aumana^Aumana^^^^Aumana at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to use the Renewing Tourniquet on 10 Wounded Skirmishers.^You there, <class>! Help me! We're losing valuable lives! There are simply too many wounded for me to tend to alone. If we can't get our soldiers healed we could be run out of Grizzly Hills altogether! Take this tourniquet and use it on the wounded down on the battlefield. Hurry, <name>! They're dyyying!!Kick 'Em While They're Down^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Hartsman^Sergeant Hartsman^^^^Sergeant Hartsman wants you to defeat 15 Horde units or players in Blue Sky Logging Grounds.^It is a dark day for the Alliance. Many good men lay dead or dying here. Our only consolation is that they fought well and brought down many of the enemy with them. With the bulk of our forces committed to Venture Bay we stand alone to weather this storm. The resources in this region are vital to the Alliance and may well make the difference in our struggle against the Horde. We must not fail! Go, <name>. Strike at them while they lick their wounds. Avenge your fallen brothers and keep our hopes alive!The Murkweed Elixir^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Orik Trueheart^Orik Trueheart^Imprints on the Past^^^Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight wants you to recover 5 Murkweed from the Eldritch Heights.^The spirits of the damned haunt the coast. In life they were brave and noble soldiers of the Alliance, but in death they are cursed - bound to this world until the end of days. We must discover the source of their anguish if we are to free them! To the southeast, on the Eldritch Heights, you will find a rare herb known as murkweed. It is murkweed that I will use to concoct an elixir that will allow you temporary entry into the world of the forgotten. Go now and gather the weed.The Forgotten Tale^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Orik Trueheart^Orik Trueheart^Imprints on the Past^^^Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight wants you to hear the tales of a Forgotten Peasant, Forgotten Rifleman, Forgotten Knight and Forgotten Footman.^The toxins in the murkweed elixir will render you unconscious. So powerful is the effect of the murkweed that even your spirit will be fooled, allowing you to temporarily enter the world of the dead. Once a spirit, you must speak to the ghostly denizens of the Forgotten Shore. Seek out the cause of their anguish and return to me. Remember, <name>, these spirits were once Alliance soldiers. Treat them with respect, honor and dignity. Now, with elixir in hand, venture south to the Forgotten Shore.Local Support^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Dumont^Lieutenant Dumont^Local Support^^^Lieutenant Dumont at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Evergreen Trading Post and obtain the Cedar Chest.^We've reached a deadlock with the Horde in Grizzly Hills. Our forces are just about evenly matched and all signs so far have pointed to a stalemate. Until this morning, that is. The local trappers have requested our help. Apparently the Horde took something that belongs to them... a relic of some sort. We get this back for them and they'll give us the edge we need. Head to the Evergreen Trading Post, west of Conquest Hold and look for a cedar chest.Close the Deal^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Dumont^Ivan^Local Support^^^Bring the Cedar Chest to Ivan at Aspen Grove Post.^We have what the trappers want. Now it's up to us to sign them up with our side. Take the chest to a trapper named Ivan at the Aspen Grove Post, just north of here. If all goes well, we'll have local woodsmen serving as scouts for the king's army in no time.A Tentative Pact^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Ivan^Lieutenant Dumont^Local Support^^Secrets of the Flamebinders, Thinning the Ranks^Return to Lieutenant Dumont in Amberpine Lodge.^Very well, <name>. Your people kept their end of the bargain. Tell Dumont that we'll honor the deal.An Exercise in Diplomacy^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Dumont^Envoy Ducal^Local Support^^Northern Hospitality, Wolfsbane Root^Speak to Envoy Ducal in Silverbrook.^We'd been trying to negotiate with the trappers for weeks, but we'd gotten nowhere until you found that blasted chest of theirs. This should be good news to our envoy in Silverbrook. We sent Ducal there about a week ago and his last letter indicated he'd been making little progress. Go to Silverbrook and aid him in his diplomatic efforts. Take the roads heading northwest of here and you should find it after crossing a couple of bridges.Life or Death^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Rheanna^Rheanna^^^^Rheanna at Blue Sky Logging Grounds wants you to use the Renewing Bandage on 10 Wounded Westfall Infantry units.^Oh, the carnage.... I've been through many battles, <class>, and this one was more brutal than any I've seen. Our fight with the Horde has become more intense than ever. It's them or us here in Northrend - life or death. If we are to survive here another day we'll need to mend our wounded. There are too many for me to rescue alone. I've prepared special bandages that will enable you to assist me. Take one and tend to those who have not yet succumbed to their wounds.Of Traitors and Treason^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Captain Adams^Greer Orehammer^Of Traitors and Treason^^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Captain Adams has asked you to show the Alliance Missive to Greer Orehammer at Westguard Keep.^The list I hold must be delivered to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at Wintergarde Keep on the eastern borders of the Great Dragonblight. If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic. Hurry, <name>. Show the document to Greer Orehammer here at Westguard Keep and explain the nature of your mission. He'll put you on his fastest gryphon to Wintergarde!High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Greer Orehammer^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Of Traitors and Treason^^^Deliver the Alliance Missive to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in eastern Dragonblight.^<Greer hands the missive back to you.> Skysong will take you to Wintergarde, <name>. I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now!Northern Hospitality^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Sergei^Sergei^^An Exercise in Diplomacy^Test of Mettle^Sergei at Silverbrook wants you to slay 8 Conquest Hold Marauders.^It's good to meet you. Let us celebrate our pact by partaking in some good old fashioned Horde-killing. You'll find marauders from Conquest Hold just outside our town, west of here. Why don't you head out there and hunt them like the filthy animals they are? Let's see if our new allies can back all their talk with some action.Test of Mettle^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Sergei^Captured Trapper^Test of Mettle^Northern Hospitality, Wolfsbane Root^^Find Sergeant Bonesnap northwest of Silverbrook and pass the Test of Mettle.^Alright, friend. You've done us a favor or two, but that's not the true test of a person's courage. Around these parts, you're not a real hunter unless you wear your prey's skin. <Sergei unsheathes his skinning knife and hands it to you.> The leader of those motherless orcs attacking our town is called Bonesnap; you'll find him at a camp further northwest. That's right. You're going to skin the monster.The Truth Shall Set Us Free^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Orik Trueheart^Orik Trueheart^Imprints on the Past^^^Orik Trueheart at Dawn's Reach in Dragonblight wants you to use Orik's Crystalline Orb in the ruins located at the Forgotten Shore to redeem the Forgotten.^Zelig gave this crystal ball to me years ago with specific instruction on its use. For five years - whenever I would feel anger, anxiety, or sorrow over the events that transpired here - I was to focus my thoughts upon the orb. I now understand why Zelig gave this crystal to me. Take my crystalline orb to the Forgotten Shore. Find the ruins of my old base on the upper reaches of the beach and place the orb in the center of town. Let the forgotten see the world through my heart and soul.Words of Warning^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Captured Trapper^Caged Prisoner^Test of Mettle^^Escape from Silverbrook^Go to the northwestern end of Silverbrook.^Thanks for helping me, <name>. My name's Sasha. Listen, I have to get the hell out of here. The people that sent you here... my people... they've changed. They're not good people anymore... and they want to turn you into one of... one of them. This... 'test' they sent you on is just the beginning. Head to the northwestern end of Silverbrook. You'll find something of interest to you. Good luck... and trust no one.Funding the War Effort^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Quartermaster Bartlett^Quartermaster Bartlett^^^^Quartermaster Bartlett at Venomspite has asked you to recover 6 Forgotten Treasure.^<The quartermaster lowers his voice and whispers to you.> <class>, I need your help; our coffers are empty. The Kor'kron Vanguard at the Wrath Gate has taken all of our coin for the fight there. But, I've heard whispers that there's treasure to be had amongst the wrecks on the Forgotten Shore to the southeast. We have to do something soon, or we won't be able to continue the fight against the Scarlet Onslaught. War isn't cheap, you know!Beachfront Property^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Surveyor Hansen^Surveyor Hansen^^^^Surveyor Hansen, just north of the Forgotten Shore, has asked you to slay 20 Forgotten ghosts.^It's time for Venomspite to expand! We'll take care of the Onslaught in due time, but I want you to spearhead our efforts on the Forgotten Shore. The property value has outstanding potential and just look at that view! Unfortunately, there's an infestation of human ghosts, shipwrecked crews and the like who haven't quite realized that they're dead. Clear the beach and the waters off the shore, and maybe you and I will talk about building a cozy, new mausoleum down there soon.Parting Thoughts^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Orik Trueheart^Zelig the Visionary^Imprints on the Past^^The Return of the Crusade?, The Path of Redemption^Return to Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^You have honored me and honored the memory of hundreds of Alliance veterans, <name>. Zelig was wise in sending you here. Please return to him and give him my thanks. He will be happy to hear of the events that transpired at the Forgotten Shore. I do not have the gift of foresight like Zelig, but I am certain that great things await you, friend. Farewell.Wolfsbane Root^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Katja^Katja^^An Exercise in Diplomacy^Test of Mettle^Katja in Silverbrook wants you to uproot 8 Wolfsbane Roots.^Have you heard of the wolfsbane plant? It is a horrible weed... it destroys our farmable crops. We spent all of last week cutting them down, but the roots are beginning to sprout again. It might not seem like an urgent matter, but a resurgence of the plant could be a real... disaster. Do you think you could help us by uprooting them where you find them near the village?Escape from Silverbrook^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Caged Prisoner^Lieutenant Dumont^Escape from Silverbrook^Words of Warning^A Swift Response^Open the Wooden Cage and help the Freed Alliance Scout escape from Silverbrook. Report to Lieutenant Dumont when you reach Amberpine Lodge.^You... you're not one of them? Quick! Let me out! We have to get to Amberpine Lodge immediately! Once Lieutenant Dumont finds out who these people really are, this town will be reduced to rubble!Find Durkon!^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Cavalier Durkon^The Lost Courier^^^Seek out Cavalier Durkon at the Wintergarde Crypt in Dragonblight.^After the Scourge breached the south wall, I ordered Cavalier Durkon to investigate the town crypt. Moments ago I was handed his report. The undead that plague us are coming from two sources: the ruins of Wintergarde, now a breeding ground for Scourge, and our very own town crypt! Amidst the chaos and confusion the Scourge managed to get a necrolord inside the crypt. In his message, Durkon requested assistance. You will find him and help him, <name>. The crypt is on the western border of the town square.A Swift Response^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Dumont^Lieutenant Dumont^Escape from Silverbrook^^The Failed World Tree, A Dark Influence^Lieutenant Dumont wants you to go to Forest's Edge Post and slay Vladek and 7 Silverbrook Hunters.^Our response must be immediate. Decisive. We must teach these savages not to cross us. Our scouts have located what's left of the Silverbrook trappers... you know, the ones you didn't get to douse in flames. Apparently they're blockading the road to the southeast... perhaps they're trying to box us in. Head to the Forest's Edge post and take care of them. Their leader's reported to be a man named Vladek... make sure he's dealt with.The Noble's Crypt^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Cavalier Durkon^Cavalier Durkon^The Lost Courier^^^Cavalier Durkon at Wintergarde Keep wants you to slay Necrolord Amarion.^Held within the cold stone walls of this crypt are the remains of the nobles and dignitaries that died in Northrend. At its very core now sits a necrolord who raises the corpses as servants of the Scourge. You must make your way to the bottom of the Wintergarde Crypt and kill Necrolord Amarion. Only then will the assault from within cease! And <name>, be on the lookout for any information that might be laying about inside the room where Amarion resides.Secrets of the Scourge^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Flesh-bound Tome^Cavalier Durkon^Secrets of the Scourge^^^Deliver the Flesh-bound Tome to Cavalier Durkon at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^Scrawled across the flesh-bound chapters of this tome are strange symbols and shapes that seem to have been scraped into the pages with a blade. You have no idea what is written, but you are certain that whatever it is, it must be important. Deliver the tome to Cavalier Durkon standing guard topside at Wintergarde Crypt.Down With Captain Zorna!^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Baron Freeman^Baron Freeman^^^^Slay Captain Zorna and report to Baron Freeman at Venture Bay.^The Horde's forces are poised to break through our lines and complete their conquest of Venture Bay if we do not act. The Horde's forces in the port are commanded by Captain Zorna, near the ship on the far side of the bay. If you can defeat her, the Horde's offensive will falter and we can seize the chance to capture the port. Beware, <name>, for Zorna is a fierce fighter. It may take several people to defeat her, or if you have access to a repaired shredder, you might try using it to your advantage.Crush Captain Brightwater!^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^General Khazgar^General Khazgar^^^^Slay Captain Brightwater and report to General Khazgar at Venture Bay.^With every advance, our men are met by fresh Alliance reinforcements. It's almost as though their commander anticipates my every move! The time has come for good Captain Brightwater to meet his end. He commands his troops from aboard an Alliance destroyer at the far end of the bay. This will be no easy fight, <name>. Take along a couple of trusted friends, or if you have a key to one of those repaired shredders, use it to disembowel Brightwater! Either way, he must fall!Keep Them at Bay!^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Lieutenant Stuart^Lieutenant Stuart^^^^Defeat 10 Horde units or players in Venture Bay and return to Lieutenant Stuart.^We cannot permit the Horde to control Venture Bay. The port is essential to our operations in Grizzly Hills and beyond. Captain Stoutmantle has taken the rest of the Westfall Brigade east in search of a passage through the mountains, so we'll have no reinforcements. Go into the field, <name>, and kill the Conquest Hold berserkers the Horde has sent against us. Cut them down until none remain standing. The Alliance must have this port!Keep Them at Bay^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Centurion Kaggrum^Centurion Kaggrum^^^^Defeat 10 Alliance units or players in Venture Bay and return to Centurion Kaggrum.^This wretched Westfall Brigade is proving a tougher opponent than we'd thought. Though few in number, they fight well and bravely, but we cannot afford to wait them out. Conqueror Krenna's orders were to capture the port quickly. You must break the stalemate, <name>. Find the enemy's marines and slaughter them until the resistance ceases. Only then will we be able to claim ownership of the port. Go quickly. We don't want to keep Conqueror Krenna waiting.Mystery of the Tome^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Cavalier Durkon^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Secrets of the Scourge^^^Take the Flesh-bound Tome to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^What can it be, <name>? That was certainly no ordinary curse that the blasted lich put on you! <Durkon flips through the grisly pages of the tome.> I don't even know if I'm looking at it the right way. We must find out what information is held within this tome! <Durkon hands the book back to you.> The High Commander will know what to do. Take the flesh-bound tome to him and tell him exactly what happened here.Understanding the Language of Death^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Inquisitor Hallard^Secrets of the Scourge^^A Righteous Sermon^Take the Flesh-bound Tome to Inquisitor Hallard at the Wintergarde Keep prison.^Take the book and follow the path leading up to the barracks. Once inside the barracks take the staircase down to the prison. At the prison you will find Inquisitor Hallard and our mayor, Godfrey. I believe Godfrey might be the missing piece of this puzzle and Hallard the man to put it all together. Go now!A Righteous Sermon^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Inquisitor Hallard^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^^Understanding the Language of Death^Into Hostile Territory^Wait for Inquisitor Hallard to finish his Righteous Sermon and return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight with the information you uncover.^Godfrey Goodard, once a righteous man and mayor of Wintergarde, is now an agent of the Scourge. His transformation from man to undying ghoul has taken place slowly, over time. He hears the call of the Lich King now and lives only to serve his master. But as with all Scourge, Godfrey knows the language of death and with proper motivation, will tell us what we need to know about the tome. Once you hear what you need to hear, return to the High Commander at the front lines. I'll clean up here as needed.Smoke 'Em Out^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Downey^Sergeant Downey^^^^Use the Smoke Bomb to drive 20 Venture Company Stragglers from their buildings and then report to Sergeant Downey.^There are still pockets of cowardly Venture Company men holed up in some of the buildings at the center of Venture Bay. I need every man I can spare out there fighting against the Horde, but we can't allow those Venture Company stragglers to camp out in those buildings, either. Maybe we can "convince" them to make for their ship. Take this smoke bomb and use it to smoke out the stragglers from their places in the bunkhouse, sawmill, or stables. Don't get too close, though; they probably bite.Smoke 'Em Out^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Stone Guard Ragetotem^Stone Guard Ragetotem^^^^Use the Smoke Bomb to drive 20 Venture Company Stragglers from their buildings and then report to Stone Guard Ragetotem.^Not only is this port infested with sniveling Alliance cowards, but to make matters worse, there are still Venture Company employees holed up in some of the buildings. They're not worth the time it takes to kill and I can't spare the warriors anyway. Maybe we can "convince" them to make for their ship. Take this smoke bomb and use it to smoke out the stragglers from their places in the bunkhouse, sawmill, or stables. Don't get too close, though; there's no telling what diseases they're carrying.Into Hostile Territory^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Duke August Foehammer^Into Hostile Territory^Understanding the Scourge War Machine, A Righteous Sermon^^Speak with Gryphon Commander Urik to secure a ride to Thorson's Post. Report to Duke August Foehammer when you arrive at Thorson's Post in Dragonblight.^You have done much to advance our efforts against the Scourge, <name>. In fact, the morale of all those who have come into contact with you soars! Such is your influence over the soldiers and citizenry of Wintergarde, ally. And because of you we are now prepared to go on the offensive! You are to report to Duke August Foehammer, across the Carrion Fields at Thorson's Post, east of here. Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station has prepared a special gryphon to drop you behind enemy lines. Go now!Steamtank Surprise^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Duke August Foehammer^Ambo Cash^Into Hostile Territory^^^Use an Alliance Steam Tank to destroy 6 Plague Wagons and deliver the 7th Legion Elites to Wintergarde Mausoleum. Speak with Ambo Cash inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight should you succeed.^This is a seek and destroy mission. You'll be driving a tank into the Carrion Fields to dismantle Scourge plague wagons. With the tank comes a crew of three 7th Legion soldiers. All must survive if this mission is to succeed! You'll need to get in close to a plague wagon to unleash your engineer. Let them do their deed and move on to the next one. When the field is clear of plague wagons, head to the mausoleum in front of the ruined keep and drop off the rest of your crew. Meet with Ambo Cash inside.Out of Body Experience^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Ruuna the Blind^Ruuna the Blind^Ruuna the Blind^^^Drink the Gossamer Potion near Ruuna's Crystal Ball and witness the Vision from the Past.^Ah, you seek a vision of the past. You're a wise <race>. Every time someone drops by for a reading, they seem to always ask about the future. When you get to be my age, you learn that scrying the past, more often than not, is more useful. Drink this potion and peer into my crystal ball. Let us see what knowledge we can obtain.Ruuna's Request^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Ruuna the Blind^Ruuna the Blind^Ruuna the Blind^^^Ruuna the Blind wants you to obtain 4 handfuls of Gossamer Dust.^I will not charge you gold for my services, for I can foresee that your actions are necessary and much hinges on what you learn today. I will, however, ask you to collect a reagent for me. Obtain gossamer dust from the fern feeder moths northeast of here. Do this and I will prepare a potion that will take you to the time and place where the events took place that you need to witness.Fate and Coincidence^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Ruuna the Blind^Sasha^Ruuna the Blind^^Sasha's Hunt, Anatoly Will Talk^Speak to Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post.^There are two types of people in this world, <name>. Those who believe in coincidence and those who don't. On the day I lost my eyesight I was given the gift of clairvoyance. I suppose you can guess what sort of person I am. Earlier today, a young woman named Sasha was granted the same vision you were. You will want to talk to her. You'll find her directly east of here at the White Pine Trading Post, on the way to Solstice Village.Anatoly Will Talk^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Sasha^Sasha^^Fate and Coincidence^A Sister's Pledge^Sasha at the White Pine Trading Post wants you to take the Tranquilizer Dart and use it on Tatjana in Solstice Village. Bring Tatjana back to the White Pine Trading Post.^My sister is here somewhere, and I can't seem to get this monster to talk. He doesn't seem to care about his own well-being, but I've an idea. I knew Anatoly's wife, Tatjana, from before the wolfcult arrived -- she was a horse-handler. Take this tranquillizer dart. Bring her back alive, we're going to need her if we're to have any leverage with Anatoly. I will help you find the person behind all this once we save my sister.Defending Wyrmrest Temple^74^All^Dragonblight^Lord Afrasastrasz^Lord Afrasastrasz^A Strange Device^^^Afrasastrasz at Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to slay 3 Azure Dragons, slay 5 Azure Drakes, and to destabilize the Azure Dragonshrine while riding a Wyrmrest Defender into battle.^Emboldened by the overabundance of magic now flowing through the Azure Dragonshrine, the blue dragonflight has dared to attack Wyrmrest Temple itself! I ask that you ride one of our defenders into battle to slay their dragons and drakes, and to attack the eruption of ley line energies at the dragonshrine itself in order to destabilize it. Outside on the east and west terraces are wyrmrest defenders. Speak with one to ride it into battle. Without your help, <name>, we will surely lose.A Sister's Pledge^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Sasha^Anya^^Anatoly Will Talk^Hour of the Worg^Look for Anya in the Duskhowl Den near Solstice Village.^Please, <name>. I know it is Arugal you're after. I swear on my father's memory I will help you take him down. But I must beg you... Anya is completely innocent, we cannot leave her with these savages. Help me rescue my sister and you'll have me at your side when you face Arugal. I know the den Anatoly spoke of. We'll find it on the other side of this hill. Let's go, my sister's in danger.My Enemy's Friend^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Conqueror Krenna^Conqueror Krenna^The Flamebinders' Secrets^^^Conqueror Krenna in Conquest Hold wants you to slay 8 Silverbrook Hunters and their leader, Vladek, at the Forest's Edge Post.^If there is one thing I can get through your head, let it be this: the Alliance will be crushed in the Grizzly Hills. There is far too much lumber, ore, game and strategic territory for us to give up on any single battlefront here. So far we've been successful... but there's something that could tip the scales in our enemy's favor. Far to the east of here, at the Forest Edge's Post, local trappers seek to join the Alliance. Slaughter them before they have the chance to do so.Attack on Silverbrook^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Conqueror Krenna^Conqueror Krenna^The Flamebinders' Secrets^^Vordrassil's Fall, The Darkness Beneath, The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling!^Conqueror Krenna at Conquest Hold wants you to slay 8 Silverbrook Defenders in the Silverbrook Hills.^A few hours ago, the trappers were nothing but peasants threatening to add their number to the Alliance's. Now they've become something else... an uncertainty. I do not like uncertainties. Go to the hills outside their main town in northern Grizzly Hills, Silverbrook, and help my men crush them.Mounting Up^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Squire Percy^Squire Percy^^^^Ride 5 Highland Mustangs back to Squire Percy at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.^Cap'n Stoutmantle left most of our calvary... cavlary... uh, horsemen at the fight for Venture Bay. We chose a good place to put the camp 'cause there are tons of highland mustangs running around near here and in the Boulder Hills to the northeast. The Cap'n put me in charge of capturing some of 'em. Will you help? I've got a stick and some string, and there are loads of wild carrots growing near the camp. Pick the carrots and use them with the stick to lure in the mustang, then ride it back here.The Horse Hollerer^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Soulok Stormfury^Soulok Stormfury^^^^Scare 15 Highland Mustangs and return to Soulok Stormfury at Camp Oneqwah.^The Alliance's 'Westfall Brigade' is camped far to the north, near Thor Modan. They have foolishly divided their forces to contest our control of Venture Bay, and they have been left without cavalry. They're now trying to capture and tame the wild highland mustangs that roam the area around the Westfall Brigade Encampment and Boulder Hills. We must stop them before they're able to replace their lost mounts. Take this and throw it near the horses to drive them away.Heated Battle^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ceristrasz^Ceristrasz^A Strange Device^^^Aid Captain Iskandar in holding the canyons by participating in the death of 12 Frigid Ghoul Attackers, 8 Frigid Geist Attackers, and 1 Frigid Abomination Attacker.^The Scourge have overrun the shrine. The shrine's keeper, Dahlia Suntouch, is nowhere to be found. The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal emberwyrms. The situation is dire, <race>. Captain Iskandar leads a group of your kind in stemming the flow of the Scourge out of the shrine. Go to his aid... but please stay behind his men. The flow of Scourge is endless and I don't want to lose you in one of those scarred canyons.Return to the Earth^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ceristrasz^Ceristrasz^A Strange Device^^^Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through one of the northern or southern passes and search for Ruby Acorns. Use the Ruby Acorns on the fallen red dragons to return their bodies to the earth. Return to Ceristrasz once the task is complete.^I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks. Get into the shrine through one of the other passes to the south or north... the Scourge presence should be lighter there. Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind.Through Fields of Flame^75^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ceristrasz^Ceristrasz^A Strange Device^^^Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through one of the northern or southern passes, then kill 6 Frigid Necromancers and eliminate the source of the corruption under the shrine. Return to Ceristrasz once the task is complete.^I have one final task for you, <race>... one that should turn the tide of this fight. Return to the shrine and kill the necromancers that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine. I also need you to find the source of the corruption under the shrine and put an end to it. I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle.The Fate of the Ruby Dragonshrine^75^All^Dragonblight^Ruby Brooch^Krasus^^^^Bring Dahlia Suntouch's Ruby Brooch to Krasus in the Ruling Council Chamber at Wyrmrest and inform him of Dahlia's fate.^As you pick up the brooch, its faint glow brightens slightly. Krasus will want to know of Dahlia's fate. Take the brooch to him at Wyrmrest.Tactical Clemency^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Gorgonna^Captured Trapper^Mikhail's Journal^^The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling!^Deliver the Letter of Amnesty to the Captured Trapper in Silverbrook Hills.^Listen, <name>. I need you to act with discretion and speed. One of Krenna's top sergeants has captured a trapper outcast outside of Silverbrook. Now, if things turn out the way they usually do, the prisoner is going to be executed before the day is over. We can't let that happen. You see, the prisoner matches the description of Mikhail's older daughter in his diary. If we set her loose and follow her closely, she'll lead us to whoever's controlling the trappers. Take this letter to her.Mikhail's Journal^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Mikhail's Journal^Conqueror Krenna^Mikhail's Journal^^^Bring Mikhail's Journal to Conqueror Krenna in Conquest Hold.^From what you can gather, this journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail. It is written in some variant of the common human tongue. Perhaps you should bring this back to Conqueror Krenna.Gorgonna^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Conqueror Krenna^Gorgonna^Mikhail's Journal^^^Bring Mikhail's Journal to Gorgonna in Conquest Hold.^This book is written in the pig-tongue the humans use. It needs to be burned immediately. Hand it to my sister Gorgonna and do not waste my time.Ruuna the Blind^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Gorgonna^Ruuna the Blind^Ruuna the Blind^^^Speak to Ruuna the Blind at Ruuna's Camp near Vordrassil Pass.^This trapper business has the potential to be more important than we've accounted for. If they're not with the Alliance, there's a good chance they're with the Scourge, which could mean trouble. Our previous efforts might've paid off, though. We spotted our former captive meeting with a fortune teller of some sort before we lost track of her. I'm almost certain now that she will take us to their leader if we can find her again. Find Ruuna the Blind and see what you can find out.The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling!^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Grennix Shivwiggle^Bookie Vel'jen^Gray Worg Hides^Delivery to Krenna, Attack on Silverbrook, Tactical Clemency^^Defeat Ironhide inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward.^So you're interested in the fights, eh? Well, Krenna has outlawed pit-fighting for all enlisted combatants. But you, my friend, are technically a free agent and are not included in this prohibition. Nice loophole, eh? Anyway, if you're interested I can start you off with something easy, a measly bear. I'll even let you bring friends along!The Conquest Pit: Mad Furbolg Fighting^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Grennix Shivwiggle^Bookie Vel'jen^Gray Worg Hides^^The Conquest Pit: Blood and Metal^Defeat Torgg Thundertotem inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward.^You're not bad. Not bad at all. Think you can take a furbolg? What about one of those extra-large crazed Northrend furbolgs? Good, good. Get your crew together, and head to the ring. Let's give these folks a show... maybe we can earn some more coin while we're at it.The Conquest Pit: Blood and Metal^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Grennix Shivwiggle^Bookie Vel'jen^^The Conquest Pit: Mad Furbolg Fighting^The Conquest Pit: Death Is Likely^Defeat Rustblood inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward.^It's nice to have a real fighter around these parts... we'd only had prisoners and caged beasts for the past few weeks. The people get bored, ya know? Anyhow, your next challenge is a genuine iron golem stolen from the depths of Thor Modan... think you can swing it?The Conquest Pit: Death Is Likely^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Grennix Shivwiggle^Bookie Vel'jen^^The Conquest Pit: Blood and Metal^The Conquest Pit: Final Showdown^Defeat Horgrenn Hellcleave inside the Conquest Pit and speak to Bookie Vel'jen for a reward.^I'm gonna shoot straight with ya, kid. This next contender's a murderer. Literally. He was to be executed last week, but he strangled the hangman with his left hand, so Krenna's guards sort of let me have him. Feel free to pass on this one. I wouldn't blame ya.The Conquest Pit: Final Showdown^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Grennix Shivwiggle^Gorgonna^^The Conquest Pit: Death Is Likely^^Defeat Krenna in the Conquest Pit and speak to Gorgonna for a reward.^You must've really upset Krenna. She and Gorgonna have had a spat and you're wanted in the pit immediately. There are some wild rumors that it's a fight to the death! That would be bad news for you, but great news for our business venture! At any rate, you can't run away from fate... best get in there on the quick and get it over with.Riding the Red Rocket^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^General Gorlok^General Gorlok^^^^General Gorlok at the lighthouse in Venture Bay wants you to destroy the Alliance Lumber Boat.^You there, <race>! Get your lousy carcass over here! The Alliance have a shipment of lumber all ready for transport just northeast of here. Since getting our hands on that wood is out of the question, there's only one thing to do - destroy it! The goblin at the end of the dock here has some torpedoes all ready to go. He's got all the fuel for them on the docked goblin ship to the north. Get some fuel, then commandeer one of the torpedoes and ride it into their ship. Dismissed!Seeking Solvent^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Gurtor^Gurtor^^^^Gurtor at the Venture Bay Horde base wants you to bring him a canister of Element 115.^Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket.... Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean. Tell ya what, <race>. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent. Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble.Report to Lord Afrasastrasz^74^All^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Lord Afrasastrasz^A Strange Device^^^Speak with Lord Afrasastrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.^I abhor the loss of life... any life. But I will not stand idly by and allow Malygos to kill us and defile the temple! I have appointed Lord Afrasastrasz as the commander of Wyrmrest's defenses. Speak with Torastrasza to ride a drake down to him. Please lend him your aid, <name>. Your involvement with the defense of Wyrmrest will be critical to us prevailing against the blue dragonflight.Supplemental Income^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Provisioner Lorkran^Provisioner Lorkran^^^^Provisioner Lorkran at Conquest Hold wants you to obtain 5 Succulent Venison from the nearby Tallhorn Stag.^Hail, <class>. You'll find that here at Conquest Hold, we buy and sell what Krenna wants us to buy and sell... at the price that Krenna wants us to buy and sell. All this is stifling business. I'm hoping to make a little bit of coin on the side and feed our grunts at the same time. Why don't you go hunt down some stag and bring me the venison? They're numerous in the area, so bring me only the best meat.Riding the Red Rocket^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Commander Howser^Commander Howser^^^^Commander Howser at the lighthouse in Venture Bay wants you to destroy the Horde lumber shipment.^Listen, <name>. This battle is as much over resources as tactical supremacy. I have a mission that could turn the tide in our struggle against the Horde here. There are torpedoes at the end of the dock that we can use to take down the Horde's lumber ship to the northwest. You'll need to get some of the fuel that's stored on the docked goblin ship just north of here, then ride one of the torpedoes into their transport!Wanted: Kreug Oathbreaker^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Wanted!^Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig^^Return to the High Commander^^Kill Kreug Oathbreaker and return to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight to collect your reward.^Posted by: Illusia Lune The Scourge flesh giant known as Kreug Oathbreaker was responsible for the deaths of my husband, children and my dear friends, the Whisperveils. Those brave enough to take on this bounty will find Kreug in the southeastern reaches of the Carrion Fields. I demand justice! Kill Kreug Oathbreaker! In the event that Kreug is slain, I have pooled money and items together and given them to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig to give out as a reward. Please vindicate us!A Disturbance In The West^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Vas the Unstable^Rodney Wells^A Disturbance In The West^^To Stars' Rest!^Speak to Rodney Wells at Wintergarde Keep to secure a ride to Stars' Rest in western Dragonblight.^Another force threatens to destroy all that we have worked for, <name>. You must head westward to Stars' Rest. Archmage Modera has sensed a great disturbance in the magical ley lines of our world that must be dealt with immediately! Go now, <name>! Speak to Rodney Wells at the gryphon station here in Wintergarde and let him know the nature of your mission. He will place you on his fastest gryphon to deliver you to Stars' Rest. Speak with Archmage Modera when you arrive.To Stars' Rest!^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Rodney Wells^Image of Archmage Modera^A Disturbance In The West^^Rifle the Bodies^Speak with the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest in western Dragonblight.^When you are ready I will place you on my fastest gryphon to Stars' Rest. Once you get there, find and speak with Archmage Modera. Good luck, ally!Wanted: High Shaman Bloodpaw^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Wanted!^Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig^^Return to the High Commander^^Kill High Shaman Bloodpaw and return to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight to collect your reward.^Posted by: Drolfy While out in the Eldritch Heights with my cousins, Skrotee and Brote, a vicious band of wolvar from the Bloodpaw tribe attacked us. We attempted to flee, but I fear they got Skrotee and Brote. I demand retribution! Is there someone brave enough to venture to the southeastern reaches of Dragonblight, to the Eldritch Heights, and kill High Shaman Bloodpaw and his cronies? I have given a hefty sum of gold to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig to disperse to anyone that claims this bounty!Wanted: Onslaught Commander Iustus^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Wanted!^Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig^^Return to the High Commander^^Kill Onslaught Commander Iustus and return to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight to collect your reward.^Posted by: Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig Upon the northeastern path from Wintergarde a battalion of 7th Legion were ambushed and slain by Onslaught Commander Iustus and an army of mindless Scarlet Onslaught zealots. Such cold and calculated actions must be met with force! Wintergarde demands justice! Seek out Onslaught Commander Iustus at Onslaught Base Camp to the northeast and end his miserable existence. I will hand out the reward for this bounty to any who would dare take up the task!Seeking Solvent^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Barblefink^Barblefink^^^^Barblefink at the Alliance base in Venture Bay wants you to bring him a canister of Element 115.^Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket.... Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean. Tell ya what, <race>. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent. Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble.Blackriver Skirmish^74^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Scout Captain Carter^Scout Captain Carter^^^^Scout Captain Carter wants you to kill 10 Horde units or players in the Blackriver Logging Camp.^The Venture Company's on its way out of Grizzly Hills. They used to run logging operations here, but things got a little too dangerous for them. Their abandoned sites are up for grabs and we sure as hell can't let the Horde get their hands on them. The Blackriver Logging Camp is the smallest of the three logging sites in this zone, but we still need it. Do your part and fend off the Horde forces. Any lumber they get here will be made into weapons to be used against us elsewhere.The Obsidian Dragonshrine^74^All^Dragonblight^Nalice^Serinar^^^No Place to Run, No One to Save You^Travel to the Obsidian Dragonshrine Northwest of Wymrest and just West of the Wrath Gate. Locate Serinar inside of the shrine and offer him your aid.^The Scourge come. Korialstrasz calls upon his allies in a futile attempt to save their Ruby Dragonshrine, but it seems the good graces of the red flight don't extend to saving the shrines of the other flights. Surprised? I'm not. There is another of my brood who has left to clear our Obsidian Dragonshrine of the undead vermin that now infest it. All it would take to prove yourself more noble and righteous than Alexstrasza herself is a quick jaunt over there and a few swings of a blade. I'm amused.Heated Battle^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Vargastrasz^Vargastrasz^A Strange Device^^^Aid Captain Drayzen in holding the canyons by participating in the death of 12 Frigid Ghoul Attackers, 8 Frigid Geist Attackers, and 1 Frigid Abomination Attacker.^The Scourge have overrun the shrine. The shrine's keeper, Dahlia Suntouch, is nowhere to be found. The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal emberwyrms. The situation is dire, <race>. Captain Drayzen leads a group of your kind in stemming the flow of the Scourge out of the shrine. Go to his aid... but please stay behind his men. The flow of Scourge is endless and I don't want to lose you in one of those scarred canyons.Return to the Earth^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Vargastrasz^Vargastrasz^A Strange Device^^^Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through the southern pass and search for Ruby Acorns. Use the Ruby Acorns on the fallen red dragons to return their bodies to the earth. Return to Vargastrasz once the task is complete.^I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks. Get into the shrine through the pass in the south... the Scourge presence should be lighter there. Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind.Through Fields of Flame^75^Horde^Dragonblight^Vargastrasz^Vargastrasz^A Strange Device^^^Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through the southern pass, then kill 6 Frigid Necromancers and eliminate the source of the corruption under the shrine. Return to Vargastrasz once the task is complete.^I have one final task for you, <race>... one that should turn the tide of this fight. Return to the shrine and kill the necromancers that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine. I also need you to find the source of the corruption under the shrine and put an end to it. I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle.Onward to Camp Oneqwah^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Sergeant Nazgrim^Scout Vor'takh^^^^Speak with Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.^While we build Conquest Hold, I sent Scout Vor'takh to make contact with our taunka allies in the east. They're based in Camp Oneqwah, which is in the easternmost part of Grizzly Hills, beyond Grizzlemaw. Make the journey there, hear Vor'takh's report and offer your assistance with anything he and the local chieftain may need. Your contributions to Conquest Hold have been exemplary and I know Vor'takh will be grateful for the assistance.Eyes Above^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Windseer Grayhorn^Windseer Grayhorn^^^^Windseer Grayhorn wants you to use the Silver Feather on 6 Imperial Eagles in Grizzly Hills.^I've been asked to lend my support to our efforts against the Alliance. At the moment our military forces are about evenly matched and we're looking for ways to find an edge. The imperial eagles that fly over the mountains and trees in this area would make excellent scouts for us. Take this silver feather and use it to bind my sight to that of them. Being able to see our enemy's movements will grant us the strategic advantage we need. You'll find abundant eagles in the mountains to the east.Cycle of Life^74^All^Dragonblight^Nishera the Garden Keeper^Nishera the Garden Keeper^Cycle of Life^^^Nishera the Garden Keeper at the Emerald Dragonshrine has asked you to slay 5 Emerald Skytalons.^Ysera sleeps in the Emerald Dream, watching over both the Dream and Azeroth. But a horrible nightmare has taken hold in the Dream, and now I fear that Ysera is being affected by it. Recently, I asked her to aid in the fight against the Scourge that are raising frostwyrms at the other dragonshrines. She misunderstood. Instead, she told our dragonshrine's defenders to treat those not of the green dragonflight as enemies. I need you to slay some of the skytalons. The shrine must regain its balance.Scattered To The Wind^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ambo Cash^Ambo Cash^Into Hostile Territory^^^Ambo Cash at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to recover 8 Wintergarde Munitions.^The munitions drop went badly, friend. The shipment of ammo from Westguard Keep was intercepted by the frostwyrms circling overhead. The flying machines were torn apart in a matter of seconds and their cargo was scattered to the wind. Most of it is still topside - on the Carrion Fields. I'm gonna need you to go back up and recover the munitions crates that are scattered all over this damned place. Hurry it up! We can't start this offensive without guns and ammo, <buddy/missy>!The Plume of Alystros^74^All^Dragonblight^Nishera the Garden Keeper^Nishera the Garden Keeper^Cycle of Life^^^Nishera the Garden Keeper at the Emerald Dragonshrine has asked you to acquire The Plume of Alystros.^I can feel that the shrine is not completely back in balance. The verdant keeper has been angered by our actions, and I sense that he will not listen to reason. Alystros is an immense skytalon who perches at the south end of the Emerald Dragonshrine. It is he who is in charge of the dragonshrine's aerial defenses. I fear that we will have to deal with him. Take these skytalon molts and place them on the ground where he can see them. He will come. Bring me his plume.The Chain Gun And You^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ambo Cash^Ambo Cash^Into Hostile Territory^^^Ambo Cash at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to save 8 Injured 7th Legion Soldiers.^We've set up chain guns and barricades directly to the east and to the west. Our injured soldiers are hiding in both rooms - trying their best to not alert the mindless ghouls to their presence. Now that we have ammo, I need you to man one of the chain guns and use it to blast a path clear for our soldiers! Once you're on board, call a soldier out from hiding and then lay down heavy fire to keep the Scourge off him! Get a move on!Seeds of the Lashers^74^All^Dragonblight^Lord Itharius^Lord Itharius^Seeds of the Lashers^^^Lord Itharius at the top of Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to return with 3 Lasher Seeds.^We need more weapons in the fight against the Scourge. The natural properties of the Emerald Dragonshrine to the southeast may be the answer. Any unliving creature, save those that Sylvanas has redeemed, that steps foot in the dragonshrine falls to dust. I want to test a theory, and I want you to be my instrument in doing so, young <race>. Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and take the seeds from the emerald lashers therein.That Which Creates Can Also Destroy^74^All^Dragonblight^Lord Itharius^Lord Itharius^Seeds of the Lashers^^^Lord Itharius at the top of Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to destroy a Weakened Reanimated Frost Wyrm, Weakened Turgid the Vile, and Weakened Overseer Deathgaze.^Since we only have three seeds, we must put them to the best possible use. Your targets are one of the reanimated frost wyrms circling to the north near Galakrond's Rest, Turgid the Vile in the ruined barracks at the Carrion Fields to the east, and Overseer Deathgaze at Jintha'kalar far to the northeast. While the seeds would outright destroy one of the lesser Scourge, they will greatly weaken these three. Enough so, in fact, that you should be able to handle them on your own.Report to the Ruby Dragonshrine^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Lauriel Trueblade^Ceristrasz^A Strange Device^^^Report to Ceristrasz on the ridge east of the Ruby Dragonshrine, west of Wyrmrest.^We need you at the Ruby Dragonshrine. The dragons are beset on all sides by the blue flight and the scourge... they're in no better a state than we are. The situation seems dire, but this affords us a rare opportunity to establish a valuable alliance. I secured a regiment to aid the red dragonflight against the Scourge at the Ruby Dragonshrine. If you have a fight in you, please go find Ceristrasz on the ridge east of the shrine and help him in any way that you can.Report to the Ruby Dragonshrine^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Golluck Rockfist^Vargastrasz^A Strange Device^^^Report to Vargastrasz on a ridge outside of the Ruby Dragonshrine, just east of Agmar's Hammer.^You are leaving to the Ruby Dragonshrine. This is not a request. The dragons are beset on all sides by the blue flight and the scourge... they're in no better a state than we are. It is not often we are afforded the opportunity to redeem ourselves for the transgressions of our ancestors. I have secured a regiment to aid the red dragonflight against the Scourge at the Ruby Dragonshrine. Join them and crush the Scourge beneath your boots! For the Horde!Breaking Off A Piece^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Yord "Calamity" Icebeard^Yord "Calamity" Icebeard^^^^Yord "Calamity" Icebeard at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to kill Necrolord X'avius, Necrolord Horus, and 15 Naxxramas Scourge.^Just down the steps lies the gateway to damnation: Scourge as far as the eye can see and getting thicker with each passing moment. What little intelligence we've been able to gather indicates that two Scourge necrolords are furiously working at emptying the first two crypts down below. Before we can breach the inner chamber to Thel'zan, we'll need to take care of those two clowns and their Naxxramas cronies. Go down into the mausoleum and take out the necrolords and the Naxxramas dreadguards and shades.Plunderbeard Must Be Found!^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ambo Cash^Plunderbeard^Into Hostile Territory^^^Ambo Cash at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight wants you to find Plunderbeard.^There's been talk of a tunnel dug by Scourge that connects the embalming chambers of the mausoleum with the large crypts, now unearthed by Thel'zan and his minions. I recently sent my best rogue, Plunderbeard, in search of answers, but have yet to hear back from him. If I were a betting man I'd wager that he's a goner. I want you to go down those steps and head straight through the embalming chamber and look for Plunderbeard. Dead or alive, he'll have answers.My Old Enemy^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Commander Eligor Dawnbringer^Commander Eligor Dawnbringer^^Return to the High Commander^^Deliver The High General's Head to Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Wintergarde Keep.^My old enemy, High General Abbendis, has come to Northrend. Somehow she survived the attacks upon Tyr's Hand and brought a small force north. They've established New Hearthglen to the south. While they could prove useful in fighting the Scourge, Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles. So, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof.Plunderbeard's Journal^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Plunderbeard^Ambo Cash^Into Hostile Territory^^^Recover Page 4 of Plunderbeard's Journal, Page 5 of Plunderbeard's Journal, Page 6 of Plunderbeard's Journal, and Page 7 of Plunderbeard's Journal and return them to Ambo Cash at the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight.^Whatever was written on the remaining pages of Plunderbeard's journal must be recovered. Search the chambers located on the other side of this tunnel for Plunderbeard's assailants. They must be the ones who tore the journal apart! Should you recover the missing pages, return them to Ambo Cash at the entrance of the Wintergarde Mausoleum.Chasing Icestorm: The 7th Legion Front^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Ambo Cash^Legion Commander Tyralion^Into Hostile Territory^^^Report to Legion Commander Tyralion at the 7th Legion Front in central Dragonblight.^You need to get to the 7th Legion Front in northern Dragonblight. Return to Wintergarde Keep and take the north gate out of town. Keep north until you hit a road. Take a left on that road and follow it until you reach the snowline. Once at the snowline keep heading west until you hit the Path of the Titans. Follow that north and it'll lead you right into the 7th Legion Front. Once there, speak with Legion Commander Tyralion. He'll be expecting you. And <name> - it has been a pleasure. Farewell.Chasing Icestorm: Thel'zan's Phylactery^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Legion Commander Tyralion^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Into Hostile Territory^^^Recover Thel'zan's Phylactery from Icestorm and return it to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.^Your frostwyrm is out there. <Tyralion points west.> And it's a big one! When you're ready to fight, go speak with "Wyrmbait." He'll "fetch" her. Once Icestorm is close enough we'll chain her to the ground and finish her off! Hopefully, with your help, we'll be able to take her down and get you that phylactery. Once you've got the phylactery, return to Wintergarde Keep and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He's been making preparations for the final showdown with Thel'zan.The Conqueror's Task^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Conqueror Krenna^Sergeant Nazgrim^The High Executor Needs You^^A Show of Strength^Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim in Conquest Hold.^The Horde is a magnificent war machine and you are nothing but a cog. I am in charge of securing fuel for this machine. If I fail, the machine fails. Lumber, ore, water... it's all here and we want it. And so does the Alliance. Before we can move against the human scum, we need to solidify our control over the western region. Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim about eradicating the vrykul in Voldrune and then maybe - if you turn out to not be a complete failure - we'll send you on further tasks.Return to Sender^74^All^Dragonblight^Nozzlerust Supply Runner^Xink^Return to Sender^^^Follow the ridge to the east and deliver the pack of explosives to Xink at Nozzlerust Post in northern Dragonblight.^Upon closer examination, the goblin appears to have been running a pack full of explosives across the wastes for delivery. The harpy feathers half-buried in the snow nearby suggest how he met his ill fate. It appears that the goblin was bringing the explosives towards the Wrath Gate from somewhere to the east. It seems most prudent to follow the ridge back to the east and inform the sender of their runner's fate.Mystery of the Infinite^75^All^Dragonblight^Chromie^Chromie^^^Mystery of the Infinite, Redux^Chromie, at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, has asked you to travel to the Bronze Dragonshrine. Once inside, place the Hourglass of Eternity on the ground.^A time storm at the Bronze Dragonshrine to the northeast is keeping immortals from entering. The Infinite Dragonflight are in a fight inside with the defenders to wrest control of the dragonshrine. We must take this opportunity to gain information. You are not immortal. You can cross into the dragonshrine and use the Hourglass of Eternity. Protect the hourglass for long enough and the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight should be revealed. Be warned, the Infinite Dragonflight will try to stop you!Cruelty of the Kvaldir^71^All^Borean Tundra^Captured Tuskarr Prisoner^Karuk^^^^Speak to Karuk about the Captured Tuskarr Prisoner.^I thank you for saving me, <name>. The kvaldir are animals! They made us fight the other prisoners. It would've been more merciful to just kill us all. The youngling Karuk is still alive -- I noticed him arrive here. Tell him his father fought until the end.Finality^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Legion Commander Yorik^Into Hostile Territory^^An End And A Beginning^Take Thel'zan's Phylactery to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight.^Thanks to your heroics, Lord Fordragon has given the command to launch a full assault against Thel'zan. 7th Legion have made their way into the summoning chamber of the mausoleum and located what appears to be a gateway to hell. The only piece that's missing now is you. Take the phylactery and report to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum. There is a tunnel that the Scourge dug out just outside the keep that you can take to get to Yorik quickly. Go now, <name>! Lead us to victory!An End And A Beginning^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Legion Commander Yorik^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^An End And A Beginning^Finality^^Defeat Thel'zan the Duskbringer and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^Every good story has a beginning and an ending, <name>. While your story is far from over, I'll be damned if it's not already turning out to be the stuff of legend! No matter what happens to us when this is all over, what you've done at Wintergarde will be a tale told for years to come. Now, ally, when you are ready I will use the phylactery to coax Thel'zan out of hiding. Should we somehow succeed, report the victory to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.To Fordragon Hold!^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^Highlord Bolvar Fordragon^An End And A Beginning^^^Venture to Fordragon Hold in Dragonblight and speak with Highlord Bolvar Fordragon.^With the Naxxramas war machine stopped dead in its tracks the time has come for you to help our forces at Angrathar, the Wrathgate. Nestled against the mountain in northern Dragonblight is our base of operations, Fordragon Hold. It is there that Lord Fordragon awaits your arrival! Go now, <name>! Take the north gate out of town and travel north by northwest until you arrive at your destination. Light protect you!What Secrets Men Hide^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Zelig the Visionary^Zelig the Visionary^Imprints on the Past^^^Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to find the Onslaught Map and return it to him.^After the betrayal at the Forgotten Shore, Prince Arthas - with Muradin in tow - began his quest for Frostmourne. Could the location of the cavern where Frostmourne was found be near? What secrets could it hold? While the orb has no answers for these questions, it does show me something. To the northeast of Wintergarde Keep is an outpost built by the Scarlet Onslaught. Somewhere within that outpost is a map. The orb tells me that this map will be of great use to us. Retrieve it!The Return of the Crusade?^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Commander Lynore Windstryke^Commander Lynore Windstryke^^Parting Thoughts^^Commander Lynore Windstryke at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to kill 20 Scarlet Onslaught at the Onslaught Base Camp.^To the northeast of Wintergarde Keep is a newly built encampment, set up by the Scarlet Crusade - or rather - the Scarlet Onslaught as they now call themselves. While we are unsure as to why they are in Northrend, they are certainly no less dangerous than they were before. As of last night the Scarlet Onslaught has killed twelve of our soldiers. They must be taught a lesson, <name>. Go to Onslaught Base Camp and thin them out.The Path of Redemption^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^High Commander Halford Wyrmbane^^Parting Thoughts^^Return "The Path of Redemption" to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.^"The Path of Redemption," ever heard of it? It is allegedly a journal that holds the prophetic ramblings of High General Abbendis of the Scarlet Onslaught. Within that book can be found the motivations and goals of the Scarlet zealots - not to mention a whole lot of insanity. Venture to Onslaught Base Camp, northeast of Wintergarde Keep, and recover a copy of "The Path of Redemption" from one of the Onslaught soldiers.Frostmourne Cavern^73^Alliance^Dragonblight^Zelig the Visionary^Zelig the Visionary^Imprints on the Past^^^Zelig the Visionary at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight wants you to use Zelig's Scrying Orb at the bottom of Frostmourne Cavern. Unlock the secrets of the past!^They have labeled the cave as Frostmourne Cavern. Why the Scarlet Onslaught is interested in such things is unknown, but by the look of things, the area surrounding the cave is heavily guarded. Nonetheless, we must proceed! Take this scrying orb and travel north out of town and then northwest towards Scarlet Point. Make your way into the cave and battle your way to the bottom. Once there, use the orb. Return here with what you discover.Adding Injury to Insult^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Lydell^Lydell^The Ambush^^^Read the Vrykul Insult to Bjorn Halgurdsson in Baleheim, then lead him back to Lydell's Ambush and help slay him.^The vrykul are being clever about this. Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve. This leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead. We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult. Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals... we're not quite sure. Take this piece of paper and read it to him. Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here. We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive.Against Nifflevar^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Ranger Captain Areiel^Ranger Captain Areiel^^^^Ranger Captain Areiel wants you to go to Nifflevar and slay 5 Dragonflayer Warriors, 4 Dragonflayer Rune-Seers and 4 Dragonflayer Hunting Hounds.^We await reinforcements from Vengeance Landing to move against Nifflevar. If we were to capture it earlier, though, it would provide us with a great advantage over the Alliance. Head into town and see if you can put a dent in their numbers.Shimmercap Stew^75^All^Grizzly Hills^Prigmon^Prigmon^Shimmercap Stew^^^Prigmon in Granite Springs wants you to collect 5 Shimmering Snowcaps and 5 Ice Serpent Eyes from Drak'Zin Ruins and 5 Sweetroot from Zeb'Halak.^Say, while yer here, how bout ya help ol' Prigmon with a little chore? I got a friend who can make a mean stew - one like ya never tasted before! There be a few ingredients found in these parts that he be needin'. They be in ruins to the southwest and the camp just north o' here. Whatd'ya say, mon?Scourgekabob^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Prigmon^Mack Fearsen^^Vial of Visions^Seared Scourge^Prigmon at Granite Springs wants you to bring a Mummified Troll Carcass to Mack Fearsen and place it in the fire.^Ugh. Wrappin' up these unfortunate trolls be makin' my heart ache, but not so much as my back! Help ol' Prigmon out and haul one of these carcasses over to Mack. If we don't burn 'em they be walkin' again in no time.To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^71^Horde^Borean Tundra^Sauranok the Mystic^Spirit Talker Snarlfang^To Bor'gorok Outpost, Quickly!^^^Speak with Spirit Talker Snarlfang at Bor'gorok Outpost.^Did you feel it? <Sauranok momentarily clutches his chest in confusion. His hand comes away trailing red-hot steam.> Something terrible has happened to my old friend, Farseer Grimwalker. I just sensed it. He had a pupil that he took with him when he went north. They were going to help the overlord establish an outpost on the edge of Sholazar Basin. Her name is Snarlfang. She is a spirit talker. Perhaps she will know what happened. Or, at least, she can help you to find out.To Conquest Hold, But Be Careful!^74^Horde^Grizzly Hills^High Executor Wroth^Conqueror Krenna^The High Executor Needs You^^^Present yourself to Conqueror Krenna at Conquest Hold in the Grizzly Hills.^I've received a request for help from our base in the Grizzly Hills. I'm sending you to see Conqueror Krenna. <The high executor waves a sheaf of parchment in the air as if he could care less what is written on it.> She's attempting to secure all of the natural resources or somesuch. Just watch your back around her. The word is that she's aggressive even for an orc. Follow the road east and then southeast. Cross the bridge at the Dragonspine Tributary and go east from the Evergreen Trading Post.The High Executor Needs You^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Senior Sergeant Juktok^High Executor Wroth^The High Executor Needs You^^^Speak with High Executor Wroth at Venomspite in Dragonblight.^It's a good thing that I intercepted this request from High Executor Wroth before it got to Overlord Agmar. What is Wroth thinking? <The sergeant rips up the letter that he's holding.> <class>, go see what it is that the high executor wants. Follow the road east and pass through The Dragon Wastes. You'll find a path leading up out of the wastes on the southeast side, and the Forsaken town, Venomspite, will stand before you on the south side of the mountain.Welcome to Sholazar Basin^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Monte Muzzleshot^Hemet Nesingwary^Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary?^^^Follow the path to the northwest to reach the camp that Monte mentioned.^So, where did you come from? I don't suppose that fool of an archmage sent you, too? You're lucky to be in one piece, <laddie/lass>! They nearly blew you up! The jungle here's a darned dangerous place, 'specially with the Venture Company about.  Git you! Go see the boss... he'll sort you out. The camp's at the end of that path to the northwest. Now, git!Audience With The Dragon Queen^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Highlord Bolvar Fordragon^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^An End And A Beginning^^Galakrond and the Scourge^Seek out Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.^Our assault against Angrathar has staggered the Scourge, but they remain unrelenting. From overhead they send their frost wyrms to strafe the field of battle, making an advance upon the gate itself impossible. The frost wyrm attacks must be stopped, but before we defile the bones of ancient dragons, we must gain permission from their queen. Travel southeast to Wyrmrest Temple and seek out Queen Alexstrasza. Tell her what we must do and ask her for guidance. Go now, <name>!Audience With The Dragon Queen^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Saurfang the Younger^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^The Kor'kron Vanguard!^^Galakrond and the Scourge^Seek out Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.^Though I know you hunger to destroy the Scourge that stand before us at the Wrath Gate, we must first deal with the threat that looms overhead. Until the strafing assaults of the frost wyrms are halted, we cannot move forward. But before we assault the dying grounds of dragons, we must first be granted permission. Venture now to the hallowed halls of dragonkind: Wyrmrest Temple. Once there, seek out Queen Alexstrasza. Ride now, <name>! Southeast, to Wyrmrest!Galakrond and the Scourge^74^All^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Torastrasza^An End And A Beginning^^^Speak with Torastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.^Atop the Wicked Coil, the Grand Necrolord of the Scourge, Antiok, sits upon the shoulders of the reconstructed storm giant lord, Thiassi. From there he commands the armies of undead to work day and night to unearth Galakrond's massive bones. Should they succeed in raising Galakrond, all of your efforts will have been for naught. While I cannot call down the full fury of the Red Dragonflight to assist you in your journey, I will grant you my blessing. Go now and speak with my majordomo, Torastrasza.On Ruby Wings^74^All^Dragonblight^Torastrasza^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^An End And A Beginning^^Return To Angrathar, Return To Angrathar^Destroy 30 Wastes Scavengers and recover the Scythe of Antiok. Return to Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple should you complete this task.^Use this beacon to signal a Wyrmrest vanquisher. Climb upon its back and fly north to Galakrond's Rest. Once there, command the dragon to destroy the Scourge scavengers that work to unearth Galakrond. Once the area has been cleansed, fly to the Wicked Coil, overlooking Galakrond's Rest, to destroy Grand Necrolord Antiok and recover the scythe that he uses to control the wyrms. Do this and return to Queen Alexstrasza for a hero's reward! <name>, beware the rotting storm giants that wander the area!Return To Angrathar^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Highlord Bolvar Fordragon^^On Ruby Wings^^Speak with Highlord Bolvar Fordragon at Fordragon Hold and tell him of your victory over the Scourge.^With Antiok slain and the scythe in our possession, the frost wyrm assaults upon your forces at Angrathar will halt. The wyrms that remain in the Dragonblight will be hunted and destroyed, their bones returning to the earth. The time to make your final stand is now, <name>. Return to Fordragon Hold and notify Highlord Fordragon.Return To Angrathar^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Saurfang the Younger^^On Ruby Wings^^Speak with Saurfang the Younger at the Kor'kron Vangaurd and tell him of your victory over the Scourge.^With Antiok slain and the scythe in our possession, the frost wyrm assaults upon your forces at Angrathar will halt. The wyrms that remain in the Dragonblight will be hunted and destroyed, their bones returning to the earth. The time to make your final stand is now, <name>. Return to the Kor'kron Vanguard and notify Saurfang the Younger.Troll Patrol^76^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Kunz^Commander Kunz^^Pa'Troll^^Commander Kunz at the Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their captain's orders, and then return and report to him.^Unsheathe that weapon, <race>. It's time to go on patrol! I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance. You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you. Report back to me once you've assisted each of my men. And remember, you'll be more richly rewarded for returning to me quickly - so double-time it! Dismissed!Troll Patrol: High Standards^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Brandon^Captain Brandon^^^^Captain Brandon wants you to place the Argent Crusade Banner in the Drakkari Pedestals at Drak'Sotra.^Listen, <class>. This is the Argent Crusade. Our men will fight to the end and never complain no matter what the conditions. That said, we've taken some heavy casualties in this campaign and we've been hitting it hard with little or no sleep for months. That all takes a toll on morale, whether we admit it or not. It may not seem like much, but seeing our standard raised over the battlefield is of considerable comfort to a soldier. Take these banners and raise them at the pedestals in Drak'Sotra.Defend the Stand^76^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Falstaav^Commander Falstaav^Taking a Stand^^Pa'Troll^Commander Falstaav has tasked you with the destruction of any 10 Scourge in the courtyard at The Argent Stand.^Despite our substantial successes in the lower third of Zul'Drak, we must still face the onslaught of the Scourge. Such is the way in this frigid hell. The attacks are unrelenting, yet my men need rest. If you are willing, we could use your aid in reinforcing them. Below in the courtyard you'll find no end to the fighting. Dispatch the Scourge there with all the zeal you can muster, <class>.Argent Crusade, We Are Leaving!^76^All^Zul'Drak^Sergeant Stackhammer^Sergeant Stackhammer^New Orders for Sergeant Stackhammer^^^Sergeant Stackhammer at the Altar of Sseratus wants you to speak with 10 of his Argent Soldiers and tell them to report back to him.^<The sergeant quickly reads through the orders you've handed him, a frown coming over his face.> Look, <lad /lass>, I'd love to just up and leave, but take a look out there. All of my people are fighting. Tell you what, you've come this far, you think you're up to doing me a small favor? Head out there and round up my soldiers? Tell 'em that the sergeant orders them to report back immediately. Lend them a hand if you will.New Orders for Sergeant Stackhammer^76^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Kunz^Sergeant Stackhammer^New Orders for Sergeant Stackhammer^Parachutes for the Argent Crusade^Mopping Up^Commander Kunz has asked you to deliver the New Deployment Orders to Sergeant Stackhammer at the Altar of Sseratus.^<class>, you're here to help, right? I've got new orders for our forces that are currently deployed at the Drakkari altar to the north. You can't miss it. Just head straight up the avenue. Sergeant Stackhammer shouldn't be hard to find.Trouble at the Altar of Sseratus^76^All^Zul'Drak^Hexxer Ubungo^Hexxer Ubungo^^Parachutes for the Argent Crusade^^Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand has asked you to investigate the main altar building at the Altar of Sseratus.^There's trouble at the altar of the snake god. The presence of the Scourge has weakened the land, <race>. This in turn has weakened the wild gods. We know that the Drakkari are taking advantage of this to do evil things to the gods. I need you to be my eyes and ears. The Altar of Sseratus is at the end of the avenue to the north. Sneak around the back and get a look inside of the main altar building. Whatever you do, avoid the prophet at all costs!Strange Mojo^76^All^Zul'Drak^Strange Mojo^Hexxer Ubungo^Strange Mojo^^^Deliver the Strange Mojo to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand.^This bottle of strange mojo may be the key to what is truly going on here. The Zandalari troll Hexxer Ubungo, back at The Argent Stand, may want to take a look at it.Mopping Up^76^All^Zul'Drak^Corporal Maga^Corporal Maga^^New Orders for Sergeant Stackhammer^^Corporal Maga at the Altar of Sseratus wants you to kill any combination of 10 Champions of Sseratus, Priests of Sseratus, or Drakkari Snake Handlers.^I couldn't help but overhear what you were talking to the sergeant about. That doesn't change the fact that we still have a job to do here. While you're out there, do you think you could help us to put some of those followers of Sseratus out of their misery?Troll Patrol: Intestinal Fortitude^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Rupert^Captain Rupert^^^^Captain Rupert in Drak'Sotra wants you to restore courage to the cowering Crusade Recruits.^Finally, the patrol arrives! Here's the situation, <race>. We've lost many of our finest soldiers in this campaign and have had to call upon our recruits to fill in the gaps. We've just fought one of our fiercest battles and many of the recruits were simply not prepared to face this enemy. There are more fights ahead, and I need them ready to follow orders. If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's cowardice. Perhaps you can help them find the courage to continue.Precious Elemental Fluids^76^All^Zul'Drak^Hexxer Ubungo^Hexxer Ubungo^Strange Mojo^^^Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand wants you to acquire 3 Precious Elemental Fluids.^<The hexxer examines the decanter of mojo.> I have an idea for how to deal with the prophet of Sseratus. But first, we're going to need some things. The Drak'Sotra Fields are directly to the south. Because of the stresses on the land from the Scourge and the deaths of gods, the wall between worlds has weakened and the elementals are flooding in. We need the precious fluids of their lords. If you combine three links from the elementals a tether will be made, and one of their lords can be summoned.The Hills Have Us^73^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Gryphon Commander Urik^Lieutenant Dumont^^^^Report to Lieutenant Dumont at Amberpine Lodge in western Grizzly Hills.^While we focus to hold our ground at Wintergarde and deal with the unfolding events of the Wrathgate, battalions from as far away as Westfall battle their way through the dense foliage and inhospitable denizens of Grizzly Hills. All in hopes of finding an alternate route into Icecrown. Lieutenant Dumont, stationed at Amberpine Lodge, has enlisted the aid of able bodied citizens willing to risk life and limb in the uncharted wilds. Will you rise to meet this challenge?Leave No One Behind^76^All^Zul'Drak^Dr. Rogers^Dr. Rogers^^^^Dr. Rogers at Drak'Sotra wants you to find Crusader Lamoof, Crusader Jonathan, and Crusader Josephine. Use the Crusader's Bandage on them, and escort them safely back to him.^Ahh, good. They sent someone. Listen, <race>. We need a hand here. Our forces were pushed back and we've lost Drak'Sotra to the Scourge. Where they came from is anyone's guess.... The point is, we need every man we can get here, and some of our best have yet to return from battle. I need you to enter the ruins now that the fighting has died down and find our wounded, patch them up, and bring them here to me. Scour Drak'Sotra! They couldn't have gone far.Nice Hat...^68^All^Caverns of Time^Don Carlos^Don Carlos^^^^Don Carlos has inadvertently challenged you to defeat his younger self in Old Hillsbrad. Afterwards, bring Don Carlos' Hat to him in Tanaris as proof.^My hat? Yes, it's an unusual style, I know, from far away... few tailors here know how to make them. When I was young and hot-blooded, I wore it as a standing challenge. Many came seeking to defeat me and win it for themselves... but no one ever did. Ah, but those days are long past. I'm an old man, now: I drink, I fish, but I no longer duel.Mushroom Mixer^76^All^Zul'Drak^Hexxer Ubungo^Hexxer Ubungo^Strange Mojo^^Too Much of a Good Thing^Collect 10 Muddlecap Fungus and deliver them to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand.^Now what we need is something to spike the mojo with. Something that'll make it so that when the prophet drinks it, he'll become less powerful. Drak'Agal lies to the east. There's a mushroom there that the natives call muddlecap fungus. I think it's exactly what we need. Bring back lots of them. When we mix them into the mojo, the mind of anyone who drinks it will become muddled.Too Much of a Good Thing^76^All^Zul'Drak^Hexxer Ubungo^Hexxer Ubungo^Too Much of a Good Thing^Mushroom Mixer^The Blessing of Zim'Torga^Slay the Muddled Prophet of Sseratus and then return to Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand.^There. I've modified the mojo. Now when the prophet drinks it, not only will he lose some of his power, his mind will also be addled by the effects of the fungus. At least that's the theory. As for how to get him to drink it, might I suggest you simply throw it at him? No doubt he'll catch and drink it given the arrogance that he's displayed at the altar. Unless you can kill him, <class>, your Argent Crusade is about to come to a terrible end.Troll Patrol: Whatdya Want, a Medal?^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Grondel^Captain Grondel^^^^Captain Grondel outside the Coliseum wants you to gather 7 Drakkari Medallions from the nearby Drakkari Corpses.^Look at me, <race>. Do I look like I have time fer fillin' out reports? It be all I can do to keep this post free o' the bloody Scourge, and they want me to mess with paperwork! No sense in complainin'. I need to get the commander some kinda kill count from the last skirmish. You wanna be helpful? Go and get me all the medals you can find from the dead trolls around here. That'll hafta be close enough.Rhino Mastery: The Test^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Hemet Nesingwary^Hemet Nesingwary^Rhino Mastery: The Test^Wipe That Grin Off His Face^Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial^Kill 15 Shardhorn Rhinos and return to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^No rough landing is going to stop ol' Hemet from mastering the largest game Sholazar has to offer. In the wilds northwest of the camp, the jungles are ruled by the mighty shardhorn rhino. You can prove your worth to the expedition, <lad/lass>, by showing me that you're tough enough to face down those powerful beasts.Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary?^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Archmage Pentarus^Monte Muzzleshot^Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary?^^^Talk to Archmage Pentarus when you're ready to leave for Sholazar Basin. When you arrive, speak with Monte Muzzleshot in the Wildgrowth Mangal of Sholazar Basin.^When I heard that the legendary Hemet Nesingwary was setting sail for the Sholazar Basin, I offered to help fund his expedition. We know little of Sholazar, but it's said to be a lush paradise in the midst of this frozen continent. Hemet has agreed to send back samples of exotic plants, reagents, and crystals. There hasn't been any word from him. Monte Muzzleshot was supposed to be bringing them supplies, but he hasn't returned, either. If you'll look into it, I'll send you in my flying machine.Need an Engine, Take an Engine^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Weslex Quickwrench^Weslex Quickwrench^Need an Engine, Take an Engine^^^Weslex Quickwrench at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to bring him a Flying Machine Engine.^She's ruined... ruined! I told that captain to be careful with such a precious cargo, but would she listen to me? No! When the ship ran aground, it damaged my flying machine, the Spirit of Gnomeregan. Now, we're left without any means to send our reports! There is a chance, though, that the Venture Company's antics may work in our favor. They shot down another flying machine right about where Monte parachuted into the swamp to the east. Go there and retrieve the engine. It may be our only hope.Have a Part, Give a Part^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Weslex Quickwrench^Weslex Quickwrench^Need an Engine, Take an Engine^^Aerial Surveillance, Aerial Surveillance^Bring 7 Venture Co. Spare Parts to Weslex Quickwrench at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^Great, now that we've got an engine, we're going to need an assortment of other parts to get her back in flying condition. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. A good mechanic can hold his creations together with anything, but we're better off if it doesn't come to that. Anyway, those Venture Company dullards have plenty of spare parts for their mining equipment all over Swindlegrin's Dig on the far side of that yellow crystal pillar to the northeast. Scoop up a few and bring them back here.Venture Co. Misadventure^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Debaar^Debaar^Venture Co. Misadventure^^^Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to kill 15 Venture Company members. You may kill either Venture Co. Ruffians or Venture Co. Excavators.^Ever since we arrived, the Venture Company has hampered our efforts to secure our campsite and survey the area. Normally, we wouldn't care what they were up to, but they've started antagonizing our scouts and shooting down supply flights. We can't allow this insult to stand. Hemet Nesingwary's expedition came here to hunt, and hunt it shall. Go to Swindlegrin's Dig, on the far side of the crystal pillar to the northeast, and kill any Venture Company employee you see!Wipe That Grin Off His Face^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Debaar^Debaar^Venture Co. Misadventure^^Rhino Mastery: The Test, Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator, Kick, What Kick?^Kill Foreman Swindlegrin and Meatpie and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight. The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig. Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, <name>.Rhino Mastery: The Chase^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Hemet Nesingwary^Oracle Soo-rahm^Rhino Mastery: The Test^^^Speak to Oracle Soo-rahm at the Bones of Nozronn.^Well, that's settled then. We'll seek out this native sage and have a word with him. He's not likely to volunteer his services, though. I'm told he keeps a small lean-to near the Bones of Nozronn, just across the river to the south. Seek him out, introduce yourself, and ask what he requires to help us track down this patriarch of the rhinos.Gluttonous Lurkers^76^All^Zul'Drak^Apprentice Pestlepot^Alchemist Finklestein^^^^Deliver 5 Basilisk Crystals to Alchemist Finklestein in the shrine at Heb'Valok.^My master, Finklestein, is in the shrine at Heb'Valok to the northwest preparing a truth serum, and he needs basilisk crystals. Heb'Valok is on the west side of the road leading north before the Altar of Sseratus. There are basilisks to the east at Drak'Agal. If you grab the Zul'Drak rats and throw them at the basilisk, they will become gorged and docile after eating five. Then you'll be able to take their crystals. Killing the basilisk won't do you any good. That'd just break its crystals!Playing Along^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Tracker Gekgek^High-Shaman Rakjak^Playing Along^^Tormenting the Softknuckles^Report to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill as the new "slave."^My kill! You take my kill! <Gekgek taunts you with his spear.> You dumb, <race>. Now you owe Gekgek! You be Frenzyheart slave. You slay many more beasts for Frenzyheart. You go Frenzyheart Hill to northeast - you tell High-Shaman Rakjak you the new slave. Go, <race>! Go or I taunt you a second time! <Gekgek waves his spear around menacingly.>The Ape Hunter's Slave^77^All^Sholazar Basin^High-Shaman Rakjak^High-Shaman Rakjak^Playing Along^^The Wasp Hunter's Apprentice, The Sapphire Queen^Kill 8 Hardknuckle Foragers and 6 Hardknuckle Chargers for High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill.^You think you so great hunter, eh? You no Frenzyheart, you not know of hunt. Goregek is great ape hunter. He slay so many ape you can't count on claws. You go with Goregek and hunt hardknuckles to east. You the slave, <race>. You do what Goregek tell you.Tormenting the Softknuckles^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Goregek the Gorilla Hunter^High-Shaman Rakjak^^Playing Along^The Wasp Hunter's Apprentice, The Sapphire Queen^Goregek has given you a Softknuckle Poker for use on Softknuckles to draw the Hardknuckle Matriarch out of hiding. Slay the Hardknuckle Matriarch and report her death to High-Shaman Rajak at Frenzyheart Hill.^Slave thing! Rakjak want me to babysit you while I kill hardknuckles. I feeling generous today, so I let you kill some too, but don't get in Goregek's way! Rakjak not know yet, but Goregek has eye on big bad hardknuckle mama. We go to Hardknuckle Clearing to east and poke softknuckles with poker and she sure to come yelling! <Goregek rubs his hands together gleefully.>The Underground Menace^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Elder Harkek^High-Shaman Rakjak^Flown the Coop!^^A Rough Ride^Locate Serfex under the sands of the southern river, slay him, and bring his claw to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill.^Lion killer, chicken chaser, new Frenzyheart slave... I know you no want to stay slave, so I tell you what to do. Show you better than the other Frenzyheart hunters and then Rakjak respect you. Under sands of south river there a beast that kills wasp, apes, and even wolvar. He called Serfex. You bring claw of Serfex to Rakjak and maybe he release you from slaveness. Hope Dajik teaching you good so Serfex be easy stuff.Flown the Coop!^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Elder Harkek^Elder Harkek^Flown the Coop!^The Wasp Hunter's Apprentice, The Sapphire Queen^Mischief in the Making^Capture 12 Chicken Escapees for Elder Harkek.^Dumb Goregek stumble into chicken house and let all the chickens go! They all around hill - go get chickens back! <Elder Harkek shoos you away.>The Wasp Hunter's Apprentice^77^All^Sholazar Basin^High-Shaman Rakjak^High-Shaman Rakjak^^The Ape Hunter's Slave, Tormenting the Softknuckles^Flown the Coop!^Kill 6 Sapphire Hive Wasps and 9 Sapphire Hive Drones for High-Shaman Rakjak in Frenzyheart Hill.^Rakjak not dumb. Maybe you good at killing things. Maybe Frenzyheart can make you into real hunter. Dajik hunts giant wasp things better than all wolvar. Go with Dajik to Sapphire Hive to southeast or to river in south and learn the hunt.The Sapphire Queen^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Elder Harkek^High-Shaman Rakjak^^The Ape Hunter's Slave, Tormenting the Softknuckles^Flown the Coop!^Bring the Stinger of the Sapphire Queen to High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill.^Bristlepine can be dangerous, but most stay far away from wolvar. Wasps on other hand not fear the Frenzyheart... they even kill some of our hunters. I know Rakjak want wasp queen dead, but no wolvar want to go into her hive. You go kill wasp queen in Sapphire Hive to southeast and get stinger for Rakjak. Me bet Rakjak like that.Mischief in the Making^77^All^Sholazar Basin^High-Shaman Rakjak^High-Shaman Rakjak^^Flown the Coop!^A Rough Ride^High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill wants 8 Skyreach Crystal Clusters.^You good hunter, but Frenzyheart can make you stronger. Harkek think maybe you ready for something more important. Before Rakjak send you on important mission, you need gather things for Rakjak. All along river to south are blue crystals. Rakjak need lots of blue crystals. You go get crystals now.A Rough Ride^77^All^Sholazar Basin^High-Shaman Rakjak^Zepik the Gorloc Hunter^^The Underground Menace, Mischief in the Making^Lightning Definitely Strikes Twice, The Mist Isn't Listening^Ride the captive crocolisk to Mistwhisper Refuge and then speak to Zepik for further instructions.^Zepik is best hunter of the Frenzyheart. Zepik hunts big-tongues... ugly things near swamps that try to steal all stuff they can find. Zepik going on long trek to break big-tongue shrine and try to scare them away. We no want big-tongues in this land anymore. There a crocolisk chained on northeast side of hill, next to tree - go with Zepik and do what Zepik tell you.Lightning Definitely Strikes Twice^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Zepik the Gorloc Hunter^Zepik the Gorloc Hunter^^A Rough Ride^Hoofing It^Zepik wants you to smash the Skyreach Crystal Clusters in front of the Mistwhisper weather shrine.^Okay, the crystal things... The big-tongues use the crystals to power their rain shrines. Zepik not know quite how it works, but Zepik does know that if they use wrong crystals, the clouds and the rain go crazy! Zepik tried to sneak in at one of their other rain shrines, but it not go so well. It sure to go much better with two! Take crystals, place at big stone pillar shrine thing, then smash them to release power. Zepik not sure what will happen, so might want to step back after.The Mist Isn't Listening^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Zepik the Gorloc Hunter^Zepik the Gorloc Hunter^^A Rough Ride^Hoofing It^Zepik wants you to kill 12 Mistwhisper Gorlocs.^Gorillas and wasps are boring! Big-tongues the only thing fun to hunt. While we mess up rain shrine, we kill lots of mist big-tongues. That sure to make them not want to come back to village thing. <Zepik nods to himself confidently.>Hoofing It^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Zepik the Gorloc Hunter^High-Shaman Rakjak^Hoofing It^Lightning Definitely Strikes Twice, The Mist Isn't Listening^^Find your way back to Frenzyheart Hill and speak to High-Shaman Rakjak.^Okay, we done! Time to go back. No crocolisk to ride this time though. If we go east and stay near ridge, it should lead all the way back near hill. Need to be careful not to go far below ridge though or we might go right into big-tongue tree village thing. Zepik not think they like us right now.Just Following Orders^77^All^Sholazar Basin^High-Shaman Rakjak^Injured Rainspeaker Oracle^Hoofing It^^Fortunate Misunderstandings^Locate an Injured Rainspeaker Oracle for High-Shaman Rakjak at Frenzyheart Hill.^Okay <guy/lady>, Rakjak have very important job. You go capture injured big-tongue that tracker spotted at river to north. Not bring hunter this time because they maybe want to just kill it. I want to hide it so that I can poke it and make it tell me things. Go you and bring me big-tongue prize thing.Troll Patrol: The Alchemist's Apprentice^76^All^Zul'Drak^Alchemist Finklestein^Alchemist Finklestein^^^^Alchemist Finklestein at Heb'Valok wants you to assist him in the creation of a truth serum.^Ahh, you must be the promised patrol. Your timing couldn't be better. I have urgent need of an extra pair of hands. We have a Drakkari prisoner who's been sent here to undergo questioning. Before the interrogation begins, I require assistance in the creation of a truth serum. Creating a truth serum is tricky business, demanding keen instincts, perfect timing, and improvisation at every step. Let me know when you're ready, <race>. And remember, timing is everything!The Call Of The Crusade^74^All^Dragonblight^Tilda Darathan^Crusader Valus^The Call Of The Crusade^^^Report to Crusader Valus at Light's Trust in Dragonblight.^<class>! The Argent Crusade is looking for able bodied soldiers that are willing to set aside their differences and join forces to battle the forces of the Lich King. Will you take up our cause? Should you be interested, venture north to Light's Trust and speak with Crusader Valus. You will find Light's Trust amidst the ruins of the sacked troll city of Jintha'kalar - bordering Zul'Drak. Farewell.An Offering for Soo-rahm^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Oracle Soo-rahm^Oracle Soo-rahm^Rhino Mastery: The Test^^^Bring 5 Intact Cobra Fangs to Oracle Soo-rahm, near the Bones of Nozronn.^We not know you, stranger, but we know you want something. We will talk to Bones of Nozronn for you, but you must bring us offerings. We need powerful emperor cobra fangs to complete our oracle's necklace. Go to the Wildgrowth Mangal, northeast of our hut, find cobras and bring back best fangs. Then we make bones speak to you.The Bones of Nozronn^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Oracle Soo-rahm^Hemet Nesingwary^Rhino Mastery: The Test^^Rhino Mastery: The Kill^Use Soo-rahm's Incense near the Bones of Nozronn, then return to Hemet Nesingwary at Nesingwary's Base Camp with the information you learned.^Bones of Nozronn, Oracle Soo-rahm sends <name> to you! We have prepared incense for you. Light it and place it near Nozronn's head and you will hear his voice. <Confused, you tell Soo-rahm that you haven't even told him your question.> True, we not know, but mighty Nozronn does. Do not doubt. Nozronn will answer your heart's question. Go. Nozronn not wait long.The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar^74^All^Dragonblight^Crusader Valus^Crusader Valus^The Call Of The Crusade^^Into the Breach!^Crusader Valus at Light's Trust in Dragonblight has asked you to slay 15 Jintha'kalar Scourge.^We wrested this ancient Drakkari temple from a swarm of invading Scourge. Not more than one-hundred paces from where we stand is the ruined city of Jintha'kalar. Scourge necromancers run amok, turning the living Drakkari trolls that remain into servants of the Lich King. All are now lost to the Light. All must be purged. <Valus looks upon you sternly.> All.Reclamation^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^Go to the Avalanche in Sholazar Basin and use the Omega Rune to deploy Etymidian. Use him to slay 200 Scourge Minions, Bythius the Flesh-Shaper, Urgreth of the Thousand Tombs and Hailscorn.^It is time, <name>. The Etymidian is one of the most destructive forces ever created by the titans and I am loathe to unleash him in my lands. There is little choice, however. Our enemies have forced my hand and the fury of the titans will cleanse all.The Activation Rune^78^All^Un'Goro Crater^The Etymidian^The Etymidian^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^Obtain the Omega Rune inside the Shaper's Terrace and bring it to The Etymidian.^This colossal being appears to be inactive. You notice an empty rune-shaped slot on its chest. Perhaps you might be able to find the missing rune inside the nearby overlook.The Etymidian^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^The Etymidian^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^Go through the Waygate in the southern end of Sholazar Basin and look for the weapon known as the Etymidian on the other side.^It is time, <name>. The Waygate has been activated for the first time in seven centuries. Use it to travel to where our final hope lies. Let us put an end to those who would seek to bring the taint of undeath to this pristine land. Let us unleash the Etymidian.Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Buck Cantwell^Buck Cantwell^Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator^Wipe That Grin Off His Face^Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial^Kill 15 Dreadsabers and return to Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^If you've hunted with Hemet before, you know that he's tested his skill against many large cats, but the dreadsabers here in Sholazar are different. They're able to bring down larger game than I've ever seen a cat hunt. To overcome and kill such a predator is the mark of a true hunter. If you seek to prove you're up to the challenge, test yourself against the dreadsabers. They live in the wilderness surrounding the camp and south of the river.Dreadsaber Mastery: Stalking the Prey^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Buck Cantwell^Buck Cantwell^Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator^^^Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to identify 3 Shango Tracks from the Dreadsaber Tracks near Bittertide Lake.^I have heard that the natives tell stories of a large dreadsaber they call Shango. I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp. If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints.Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Debaar^Debaar^Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial^Rhino Mastery: The Test^^Kill 15 Mangal Crocolisks and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Encampment.^I warn you, stranger -- do not make any comments about crashing the ship. I already get enough of it from the rest of the expedition. If you're looking to try your hand at hunting, though, you should test your skills against the wily mangal crocolisks. They live all along the river to the south, and in the Wildgrowth Mangal to the east. Prove you can hold your own against them and we'll talk again, hunter.Death to the Necromagi^76^All^Zul'Drak^Sergeant Moonshard^Sergeant Moonshard^Death to the Necromagi^Pa'Troll^^Sergeant Moonshard at Drak'Sotra has asked you to destroy 8 Hath'ar Necromagi.^When the trolls brought down Kolramas, it crashed next to us to the southeast. Unfortunately the crash did not destroy all of the Scourge within. Now they're raising our men from the dead and using them against us! This will not be allowed to continue. You will see to it that their necromagi are slaughtered! Do we understand each other?Skimmer Spinnerets^76^All^Zul'Drak^Specialist Cogwheel^Specialist Cogwheel^Skimmer Spinnerets^^A Tangled Skein^Specialist Cogwheel at Drak'Sotra has asked you to collect 5 Intact Skimmer Spinnerets.^Why do I always get the tough tasks to tackle? The Scourge at Kolramas have plague sprayers that are getting dangerously close. You don't want to know what's going to happen if they start heading this way! I've got an idea for how we might bring them down, but first we're going to need something... something from their own creatures. The Hath'ar skimmers can spin a very strong web that we can put to good use. Bring back some of their spinnerets.Malas the Corrupter^76^All^Zul'Drak^Sergeant Moonshard^Sergeant Moonshard^Death to the Necromagi^^^Sergeant Moonshard at Drak'Sotra insists that you return with the Head of the Corrupter.^<name>, gather at least one other person and head back down there! You'll find the leader of Kolramas, Malas the Corrupter, gloating from atop the crashed necropolis. Kill him and bring me his head!A Tangled Skein^76^All^Zul'Drak^Specialist Cogwheel^Specialist Cogwheel^Skimmer Spinnerets^Skimmer Spinnerets, Crashed Sprayer, Throwing Down^^Specialist Cogwheel at Drak'Sotra has asked you to use the Tangled Skein Thrower in order to cause the destruction of 5 Plague Sprayers.^There! One tangled skein thrower ready and waiting for you to take those plague sprayers down. You just aim and let loose. The webbing should foul up their hover spells long enough to cause them to crash to the ground just like Kolramas. Kind of poetic. I like that!Rhino Mastery: The Kill^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Hemet Nesingwary^Hemet Nesingwary^^The Bones of Nozronn^In Search of Bigger Game^Bring Farunn's Horn to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast. Are you ready to take on this rhino, <name>? For all the spirit's blustering, I'm certain it was telling the truth about the beast's strength. When you're ready to face him, head north past the Suntouched Pillar and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the Bittertide Lake. It may even venture near the Glimmering Pillar. Bring back its horn to commemorate your kill.Lab Work^76^All^Zul'Drak^Alchemist Finklestein^Alchemist Finklestein^^^^Alchemist Finklestein at Heb'Valok wants you to find a Muddy Mire Maggot, a Withered Batwing, an Amberseed, and some Chilled Serpent Mucus from within his laboratory.^I assume by your interruption that you wish to be numbered among those I am considering for apprenticeship. A worthy aspiration... Should I someday choose to accept your petition, I must be confident that you can find your way around my laboratory. I have many ingredients here; some plentiful, and others in short supply. Take your time, <class>. Find a muddy mire maggot, a withered batwing, an amberseed, and some chilled serpent mucus. Succeed, and I'll know to take your request seriously.Dreadsaber Mastery: Ready to Pounce^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Buck Cantwell^Buck Cantwell^Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator^^^Bring Shango's Pelt to Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^Shango awaits, <name>. If you have succeeded in your tracking, he will not know that you stalk him, and you will need the advantage. He is supposed to be bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than the other dreadsabers of the basin. Travel north, to the western shore of Bittertide Lake and near the falls that feed it, do battle with Shango. If you succeed, return with his pelt.Powering the Waygate - The Maker's Perch^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to go to the Maker's Perch and use the Activation Switch Gamma.^It is time then. Let us activate the waygate. You will find the first switch inside the Maker's Perch in the western edge of the basin. Beware, <name>. The titans used the perch to watch over their creations. Many of their stone servants still guard the place.Crocolisk Mastery: The Plan^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Debaar^Debaar^Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial^^^Bring 5 Sandfern fronds to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^The mangal crocolisk is a master of the ambush, and I intend to beat the best at his game. To do that, we'll need to construct a convincing camouflage for you. We'll use plants that grow in the sandy soil of the riverbanks and lake beaches. The sandfern is best for this purpose. It grows in the sandy areas near the shores of the Seabreach Flow, just to the south, Bittertide Lake and Bittertide Falls, to the north, and the edges of River's Heart, the large lake beyond the mangal to the east.An Issue of Trust^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^Force of Nature^^^Obtain Freya's trust by destroying 6 Blighted Corpses and 10 Bonescythe Ravagers in the Lost Lands.^This should never have happened. The forces of undeath storm the very cradle of life! If you're not here to destroy the minions of the Lich King, then leave at once. Do not incur my wrath by distracting me from my duties.The Drakkari Do Not Need Water Elementals!^76^All^Zul'Drak^Sub-Lieutenant Jax^Sub-Lieutenant Jax^^^^Sub-Lieutenant Jax at The Argent Stand has asked you to kill 10 Drakkari Water Binders.^Intelligence reports that ever since those water elementals appeared in the Drak'Sotra Fields, a number of Drakkari shaman have come down from the upper tiers of Zul'Drak to take control of them. I cannot stress enough, <sir /ma'am>, how dangerous that could prove. We do not want them to have water elementals at their disposal. The commander has ordered that these Drakkari water binders are to be put to the sword. Head south when you're ready.Troll Patrol^76^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Kunz^Commander Kunz^^Pa'Troll^^Commander Kunz at the Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their captain's orders, and then return and report to him.^Unsheathe that weapon, <race>. It's time to go on patrol! I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance. You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you. Report back to me once you've assisted each of my men. And remember, you'll be more richly rewarded for returning to me quickly - so double-time it! Dismissed!Troll Patrol: Something for the Pain^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Brandon^Captain Brandon^^^^Captain Brandon at Drak'Sotra wants you to collect 5 Mature Water-Poppies from Drak'Sotra Fields.^Gritty as my men are, they're still mortal. Wounds and pain diminish their ability to perform their missions. No amount of training changes that simple fact of life. Thankfully, one of our alchemists has developed a recipe for a salve that binds to our bandages and greatly reduces the pain our soldiers experience. The salve requires a special poppy these trolls cultivate just west of here. Go to Drak'Sotra Fields and harvest some of them to keep our stockpiles from running out.The Blessing of Zim'Abwa^76^All^Zul'Drak^Hexxer Ubungo^Zim'Abwa^^^Blessing of Zim'Abwa^Hexxer Ubungo at The Argent Stand wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of Zim'Abwa.^I am heartened to see the zeal with which your Argent Crusade is dealing with the Scourge, <race>. I would like to help with your efforts. The Drakkari trolls of this once-great city used to make regular offerings to their gods, but now neglect them, or worse. If you were to make offerings to the gods, they would show their appreciation in return. Zim'Abwa's statue is just to the southwest. Zim'Abwa would gladly accept your offerings of Drakkari artifacts as a sign that you are protecting Zul'Drak.Help for Camp Winterhoof^71^Horde^Howling Fjord^Longrunner Nanik^Chieftain Ashtotem^^^^Speak with Chieftain Ashtotem at Camp Winterhoof.^I am Longrunner Nanik of the Taunka, sent by the chieftain of Camp Winterhoof to seek out allies in the fight against the vrykul. They mass to the west and south of our village, and though we slay 10 of them for every one of our dead, we cannot hold. Apothecary Scyllis has promised to send brave <class>s northwest to our aid. Will you help my people fend off the vrykul assaults? Follow the road far to the northwest, across the river, and into the foothills of the mountains to reach Camp Winterhoof.Troll Patrol: Done to Death^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Rupert^Captain Rupert^^^^Captain Rupert wants you to use the Incinerating Oil on 5 Defeated Argent Footmen in Drak'Sotra.^Trust me, <race>. I know.... The smell of burnt flesh has become sickening to even me, a Forsaken. Nevertheless, it is our solemn duty to ensure that our brethren never walk with the Scourge. Pour this oil on the corpses of our fallen to ensure that we never face them on the battlefield as enemies.Crocolisk Mastery: The Ambush^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Debaar^Debaar^Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial^^^Bring Bushwhacker's Jaw to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^The largest crocolisk in the basin, known around here as "Bushwhacker" for his ambush prowess, likes to sun himself in the shallow waters of River's Heart. It's the large lake at the basin's center, and is to the east of our camp. I want you to take the camouflage I've prepared and hide on the western beach of River's Heart and ambush Bushwhacker when he shows himself. Bring back his mighty jaws if you are able to overcome him.Fortunate Misunderstandings^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Injured Rainspeaker Oracle^High-Oracle Soo-say^Fortunate Misunderstandings^Just Following Orders^Gods like Shiny Things^Escort the Injured Rainspeaker Oracle to Rainspaker Canopy and speak to High-Oracle Soo-say.^I sorry!

Do what Soo-gan says... hit the puppy-men on the nose if they being mean, they don't like that. <High-Oracle Soo-say goes back to staring at your forehead as you leave.>The Lost Mistwhisper Treasure^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Mistcaller Soo-gan^Mistcaller Soo-gan^^Back So Soon?^Home Time!^Kill Warlord Tartek and retrieve the Mistwhisper Treasure for Mistcaller Soo-gan at Mistwhisper Refuge.^So some puppy-men come and smash blue crystals at Great Mist Stone! Lots of rain and lightning and badness... blue is wrong crystal for Great Mist Stone! Dumb puppy-men. After lightning, puppy-men stole big treasure we found in the sea-lake. We need treasure back to give to Great Mist Stone! Mist Stone is angry after what the puppy-men did! One who took it named Tarter... no, Tiktak... no, no... Tartek. That it, Tartek! He went to the camp thing to north. Go get treasure back!Forced Hand^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Mistcaller Soo-gan^Mistcaller Soo-gan^^Back So Soon?^Home Time!^Kill 8 Frenzyheart Spearbearers and 6 Frenzyheart Scavengers for Mistcaller Soo-gan at Mistwhisper Refuge.^We try to be nice to puppy-men ever since they came, but they nothing but mean. We okay with them being dumb - they not do much harm. Now they mess with sacred shrines though. Sacred shrines not for messing with. The Great Stones are here from all the way back when the Great Ones made us. We wouldn't know what to do if the Great Mist Stone were hurt. Go to their camp to north... make puppy-men stop and not come back!Home Time!^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Mistcaller Soo-gan^High-Oracle Soo-say^Home Time!^The Lost Mistwhisper Treasure, Forced Hand^^Return to Rainspeaker Canopy.^You're a good dryskin. Mistwhisper safe, treasure safe, and puppy-men sure to leave us alone now. You go back to Rainspeaker Canopy and tell Soo-say you done good.The Angry Gorloc^77^All^Sholazar Basin^High-Oracle Soo-say^Moodle^Home Time!^^Lifeblood of the Mosswalker Shrine, The Mosswalker Savior^Travel to Mosswalker Village and speak to Moodle once you've arrived.^I not think you be back in time to go out again, but I wrong. I sending Moodle to nearby Mosswalker friends to bop silly Mosswalkers for not coming see shrine. Their village is east, up ridge, northeast of broken pillar. You go with Moodle! He extra smart Rainspeaker... you listen to him good-like.Lifeblood of the Mosswalker Shrine^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Moodle^Moodle^^The Angry Gorloc^^Moodle wants you to collect 10 Lifeblood Shards, but stay away from the cave inside of the pillar itself.^I've always suspected that the pillars have been the main reason for our weather and seclusion from the undead... this confirms it a bit. Not terribly long ago, there was a sound of a great explosion when the Lifeblood Pillar fell. The weather changed for the mosswalkers almost immediately... it began to snow, something we never see. They were able to stop the snow by bringing more lifeblood crystals to the Great Moss Stone. Perhaps if we can do the same, it will help ward off the undead as well.The Mosswalker Savior^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Moodle^Moodle^^The Angry Gorloc^A Hero's Burden^Moodle wants you to rescue 6 of the Mosswalker Victims in Mosswalker Village, though some of them may no longer be alive to save.^There's some small chance that the Mosswalkers are not all dead yet... and at the very least, they deserve to not be butchered like this. Let's find some revenge for this slaughter and see if there are any to be saved in the process.A Hero's Burden^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Moodle^Artruis's Phylactery^^The Mosswalker Savior^Frenzyheart Champion, Hand of the Oracles^Kill Artruis the Heartless.^Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done. We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar... the Sundered Shard. The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway. I'll place the shards and bring the news to Soo-say... you will need to find other help in the meantime.Crashed Sprayer^76^All^Zul'Drak^Specialist Cogwheel^Specialist Cogwheel^Crashed Sprayer^^A Tangled Skein^Specialist Cogwheel at Drak'Sotra has asked you to collect Plague Sprayer Parts.^I know that one of those plague sprayers crashed somewhere within Drak'Sotra to the west of us. Why don't you see if you can find it. I can use the parts from the sprayer to create the device that's going to bring those things down!Pure Evil^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Rupert^Eitrigg^^^^Captain Rupert has asked you to collect 10 Chunks of Saronite and deliver them to Eitrigg at The Argent Stand.^We know that Kolramas, the crashed necropolis to the southeast, was carrying a large amount of an ore known as saronite when the trolls shot it down. My scouts tell me that much of the saronite is strewn about within the innards of that thing. Eitrigg and his friends back at The Argent Stand want a bunch of the stuff so that they can study it. I want you to head in there and see if you can collect enough for them.Troll Patrol: Creature Comforts^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Grondel^Captain Grondel^^^^Captain Grondel at Drak'Agal wants you to bring him 20 pieces of Dead Thornwood.^Well, it ain't glamorous, but it needs doin'. My troops have been fightin' their hearts out while knee-deep in stagnant water for days on end. That just can't be good fer ya. What they need is a nice fire to dry 'em out and lighten their spirits. This part of the city's soaked, but the dead roots of these thornwood trees have a way of resistin' the moisture. Round us up some fuel for burnin' and we'll be mighty grateful.Troll Patrol^76^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Kunz^Commander Kunz^^Pa'Troll^^Commander Kunz at the Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their captain's orders, and then return and report to him.^Unsheathe that weapon, <race>. It's time to go on patrol! I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance. You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you. Report back to me once you've assisted each of my men. And remember, you'll be more richly rewarded for returning to me quickly - so double-time it! Dismissed!Troll Patrol: Can You Dig It?^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Brandon^Captain Brandon^^^^Captain Brandon in Drak'Sotra wants you to use the Steel Spade on the nearby Ancient Dirt Mounds to recover the Ancient Drakkari Relic.^One of our troops came across an old treasure map during our last offensive. If what it shows is true, then there are priceless troll artifacts nearby. My soldiers have their hands full, pressed between the Drakkari and the Scourge. I need you to follow up on this intelligence. Take this shovel and use it at the loose dirt mounds to the southwest. Return to me after a diligent search has been conducted.Kick, What Kick?^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Drostan^Drostan^Kick, What Kick?^Wipe That Grin Off His Face^^Using the RJR Rifle, shoot the apple on top of Lucky Wilhelm's head, then speak with Drostan.^So you think you can shoot? Well, let's give it a try. Here, we'll start you out with something nice and gentle. Don't worry, it's got no kick to it at all. Remember, don't point that gun at anything you don't intend to fire at. Now, when you're ready, just take aim at that apple on top o' old Lucky Wilhelm's head and let 'er fly!Troll Patrol: Throwing Down^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Rupert^Captain Rupert^^^^Captain Rupert at Drak'Sotra wants you to use High Impact Grenades near 5 Nethurbian Craters.^Clever... Just when it seemed we were getting things under control, they tunneled right underneath us and secured the shrine! Now we're caught between two nethurbian armies and our predicament is worsening by the minute. As our first course of action, we must stop them from reinforcing. Their tunnels must be sealed. Take these grenades and throw them down their craters to the northwest.The Great Hunter's Challenge^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Drostan^Drostan^Kick, What Kick?^^Lakeside Landing^Kill 60 Game Animals while you aid Hemet and his companions in their hunting. When you've killed your 60, return to Drostan at the Nesingwary Base Camp to compare numbers.^So y'have something of a hunter's instinct. You're not a bad shot, and Hemet hasn't driven you out, so he must be planning on including you in the hunt. How'd you like to have a bit of a competition, just me and you? Hemet and the others will ask you to help in their hunting. Along the way, you and I will count up the kills we contribute to their goals. Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck!In Service Of The Lich King^55^All^Death Knight^The Lich King^Instructor Razuvious^In Service Of The Lich King^^^Report to Instructor Razuvious in the Heart of Acherus.^All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge. Gaze now upon the lands below us. The Scarlet Crusade scurries to undo my work, while Light's Hope stands defiantly against us - a blemish upon these Plaguelands. They must all be shown the price of their defiance. You will become my force of retribution. Where you tread, doom will follow. Go now and claim your destiny, death knight.Troll Patrol: Couldn't Care Less^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Grondel^Captain Grondel^^^^Captain Grondel wants you to kill 7 Mossy Rampagers in Drak'Agal.^Of all the posts, they throw me in this one. The place is flooded with putrid, stagnant water and now it's host to sewage elementals! I don't really know what they are or why they're here, and frankly I couldn't care less. What I do know is they're making a mess of my sector! How am I supposed to conduct any dignified military operations with those foul things roaming around? Get out there, <class>, and don't come back 'til you've cleared your share of 'em off of my battlefield!In Search of Bigger Game^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Hemet Nesingwary^Dorian Drakestalker^^Rhino Mastery: The Kill^Sharpening Your Talons, Securing the Bait^Speak with Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost in Sholazar Basin.^Well, <name>, you've certainly proven your mettle as a hunter of all kinds of game animals -- rhinos, cats, and crocolisks. For some members of the expedition, these creatures are sufficient to test their hunting skills, but others, like myself, crave larger challenges. Dorian Drakestalker went north, across Bittertide Lake and established a camp there. He's heard rumors of gigantic primordial drakes. Just imagine what a quarry they would be! Go check up on Dorian and see if he's had any luck.Pa'Troll^76^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Kunz^Commander Kunz^Taking a Stand^Defend the Stand, Parachutes for the Argent Crusade^Troll Patrol, Death to the Necromagi, Troll Patrol, Troll Patrol^Commander Kunz at The Argent Stand wants you to visit the four Argent Crusade posts, follow their leaders' orders, and then return and report to him.^Welcome to The Argent Stand, scrub. I am Commander Kunz, but you - you can call me... Commander. Don't think you're going to just cruise through my region, picking which missions you're going to participate in, answering to no one. Here, you report to me and you follow my orders to the letter. Understood?! First, you're going to get familiar with my men and the region we're charged with clearing. Report to each of them and do as they ask. Return to me when your patrol is done.Something for the Pain^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Brandon^Captain Brandon^^^^Captain Brandon at Drak'Sotra wants you to collect 5 Mature Water-Poppies from Drak'Sotra Fields.^Gritty as my men are, they're still mortal. Wounds and pain diminish their ability to perform their missions. No amount of training changes that simple fact of life. Thankfully, one of our alchemists has developed a recipe for a salve that binds to our bandages and greatly reduces the pain our soldiers experience. The salve requires a special poppy these trolls cultivate just west of here. Go to Drak'Sotra Fields and harvest some of them to keep our stockpiles from running out.Throwing Down^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Rupert^Captain Rupert^Throwing Down^^A Tangled Skein^Captain Rupert at Drak'Sotra wants you to use High Impact Grenades near 5 Nerubian Craters.^Clever... Just when it seemed we were getting things under control, they tunneled right underneath us and secured the shrine! Now we're caught between two Nerubian armies and our predicament is worsening by the minute. As our first course of action, we must stop them from reinforcing. Their tunnels must be sealed. Take these grenades and throw them down their craters to the northwest.Creature Comforts^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Grondel^Captain Grondel^^^^Captain Grondel at Drak'Agal wants you to bring him 20 pieces of Dead Thornwood.^Well, it ain't glamorous, but it needs doin'. My troops have been fightin' their hearts out while knee-deep in stagnant water for days on end. That just can't be good fer ya. What they need is a nice fire to dry 'em out and lighten their spirits. This part of the city's soaked, but the dead roots of these thornwood trees have a way of resistin' the moisture. Round us up some fuel for burnin' and we'll be mighty grateful.Sharpening Your Talons^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Dorian Drakestalker^Dorian Drakestalker^^In Search of Bigger Game^A Mammoth Undertaking, My Pet Roc, Reagent Agent, Burning to Help^Kill 6 Primordial Drakes and then speak with Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost.^The primordial drakes occupy most of the area to the north and east, and I can feel the heat of their breath even at this distance. Before we can challenge the mightiest among the drakes, we must test our skills against the lesser creatures. Still, don't let your guard down; any one of these beasts can devour a man whole. Once you've familiarized yourself with the combat tactics of these drakes, return and I will tell you our next step.Securing the Bait^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Dorian Drakestalker^Dorian Drakestalker^^In Search of Bigger Game^^Bring 6 Primordial Hatchlings to Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost.^We're not likely to get Broodmother Slivina's attention waving our arms around like fools, but if we're smart, we can bait her into fighting us. We'll also secure more, uh, fodder for my little project. <Dorian glances over at Zootfizzle.> But don't worry about that for now. Just look for the primordial drake eggs in the area east and northeast of the camp. Burst them open and scoop up the hatchlings that come out. When the broodmother realizes what we've done, she'll have no choice but to face us.Cocooned!^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Rupert^Captain Rupert^^^^Captain Rupert wants you to open the Nerubian Cocoons in Drak'Sotra and return to him once you have freed 3 Captive Footmen.^Now that the tunnels have been sealed, our next concern is recovering those who have fallen to the enemy. With any luck, several of our soldiers are still alive and relatively well inside the nerubian cocoons. Free them, <class>, while you still can!A Mammoth Undertaking^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Zootfizzle^Zootfizzle^^Sharpening Your Talons^Post-partum Aggression^Bring a Shattertusk Mammoth to Zootfizzle at Dorian's Outpost.^Before you go off challenging Broodmother Slivina, Dorian thought it might be a good idea for you and Hemet to coordinate your efforts by riding into battle on the back of a mammoth. The area around the camp is full of them. Just take this bridle and skip it over the head of a shattertusk mammoth. Be careful of the bulls, though. They won't tolerate the harness at all. Bring the mammoth back here when you've found a suitable one.Cultist Incursion^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Cultist Corpse^Avatar of Freya^Force of Nature^^Exterminate the Intruders, Weapons of Destruction^Speak to the Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids.^<It appears the Avatar of Freya was right. The undead were not able to enter Sholazar Basin before the Lifeblood Pillar was brought down -- they used their living agents from the Cult of the Damned instead.> <You'd best warn her about the Lich King's living agents within Sholazar Basin.>Stocking the Shelves^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Arnath^Captain Arnath^^Siphoning the Spirits^^Captain Arnath in Heb'Valok asked you to collect 7 units of Fresh Spider Ichor from the Trapdoor Crawlers in Zul'Drak.^Listen, <class>. I realize that it's a lot to ask.... Fresh spider ichor is somewhat hard to come by, even in these heavily infested regions. But Finklestein said he'd settle for no less than a vat of it, and that he needs it soon. I'll keep my men out in the field collecting reagents, but if the alchemist's order is going to be filled in time, they'll require some assistance. As you roam the fields of Zul'Drak, keep your eyes peeled for trapdoor crawlers and bring me all of the ichor you can find.Clipping Their Wings^76^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Arnath^Captain Arnath^^Siphoning the Spirits^^Captain Arnath in Heb'Valok has asked you to collect 7 Unblemished Bat Wings from Zul'Drak Bats.^Ever since Finklestein's arrival, I've been relegated to collecting various ingredients for his experiments and recipes. I'll follow my orders as I've vowed to do, but I'm a seasoned veteran. I've taken part in dozens of conflicts. I'd much rather be on the front lines, having a more direct impact on the Crusade's outcome here. Help me, <race>. Collect some bat wings for me so that I might get back to the real action sooner.Returned Sevenfold^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^Force of Nature^^^The Avatar of Freya wants you defeat Thalgran Blightbringer by using Freya's Ward to reflect his Deathbolts back to him sevenfold.^The agents of the Lich King have foolishly trespassed upon these lands where the power of life rules supreme. All harm they inflict will be returned to them sevenfold. The monster directly responsible for corrupting the land is known as Thalgran Blightbringer; you will find him just to the north of here. Take this ward and use it to reflect the power of death upon him. Show the Scourge that the power of life prevails above all.The Fallen Pillar^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Cultist Corpse^Force of Nature^^Salvaging Life's Strength^Travel to the Lifeblood Pillar and look for clues to its destruction.^The titans shaped entire life forms here, fostering their unfettered growth. The five crystal pillars that surround the basin emanate pure lifeforce. The Scourge should've never been able to penetrate the basin, but one of the pillars was destroyed. Go to the Lifeblood Pillar and see if you can find out what happened. No undead would've been able to approach the pillar, so keep your eyes out for living intruders. You'll find what remains of the pillar directly south of here.Powering the Waygate - The Maker's Overlook^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^The Avatar of Freya wants you to head to the Maker's Overlook in eastern Sholazar Basin and use the Activation Switch Theta.^We cannot stop now, <race>. You've triggered the first switch, but one remains. The titans constructed a second vantage point where they oversaw their creations. You'll find it to the east, high in the mountains. Pull the activation switch theta inside the overlook and the waygate will open.Post-partum Aggression^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Dorian Drakestalker^Dorian Drakestalker^^A Mammoth Undertaking^^Kill Broodmother Slivina and return to Dorian Drakestalker at Dorian's Outpost.^Broodmother Slivina's likely to be a snarling ball of teeth, spikes, and talons. You've gone and stolen her children away and no mother takes kindly to that. 'Tis true they hatched from eggs, but she loves the little beasts no less than your mother loves you. She'll be desperate and fierce in equal measures, everything Hemet loves in a target. You and he, along with that mammoth, should be a match for her. She's on her perch at the northern edge of the Savage Thicket and hungers for revenge.The Blessing of Zim'Torga^77^All^Zul'Drak^Witch Doctor Khufu^Zim'Torga^^Too Much of a Good Thing^Blessing of Zim'Torga^Witch Doctor Khufu wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of Zim'Torga.^Hexxer Ubungo probably told you about making offerings to the gods of Zul'Drak. Zim'Abwa is not the only god that stands forgotten by the Drakkari. We have taken refuge within the presence of Zim'Torga, the Mother of Prosperity. As with Zim'Abwa, if you were to give offerings of the Drakkari to her, she is sure to give you her blessing.Chamber of Secrets^70^All^^Argent Emissary^Argent Emissary^^^^The Argent Dawn Emissary wants you to search the chamber of Tenris Mirkblood within the Servant's Quarters of Karazhan.^Excellent, an experienced adventurer. Precisely what we need. There has been talk from the Kirin Tor guarding Medivh's tower that something is amiss with Karazhan. There is a new power lurking within, one that answers neither to the Guardian's magic nor the Legion. From what they've scouted, it appears it is an elven prince called Tenris Mirkblood, and there is reason to believe he serves the Scourge. Go, my friend, investigate Mirkblood's chamber, and return with any information you might find.Exterminate the Intruders^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^^Cultist Incursion^The Lifewarden's Wrath^The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to go to the Death's Hand Encampment to the northwest and slay 8 Cultist Infiltrators.^I am an embodiment of but one aspect of Freya, daughter of the titans. I am the Lifewarden -- I was left here to protect this land against the threat of the Scourge. I never anticipated the Lich King would send willing living servants to do his work. I could easily crush these cultists myself, but I am all that stands between the undead armies and the rest of the basin. Go, <name>. Deliver my wrath to these insolent trespassers.The Emblazoned Runeblade^55^All^Death Knight^Instructor Razuvious^Instructor Razuvious^In Service Of The Lich King^^^Search the weapon racks in Ebon Hold for a Battle-worn Sword and then use it on a runeforge to craft a Runebladed Sword.^The single most important piece of equipment to a death knight is the runeblade. It is through the runeblade that a death knight commands the powers of frost, blood and the unholy. The runeblade also acts as a vessel to store the death knight's runic power. The time has come to create your first runeblade. Search the weapon racks on this floor and locate a battle-worn sword. Once found, take the sword to a nearby runeforge and use it to create a runeblade.The Lifewarden's Wrath^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^The Lifewarden's Wrath^Exterminate the Intruders^^The Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids wants you to use Freya's Horn atop of the Glimmering Pillar.^We were not quick enough, <name>. The cultist scum have arrived at the Glimmering Pillar and are making preparations to destroy it, I can sense them. We don't have much time. Blow upon this horn atop the Glimmering Pillar to channel my power through the crystal. We shall show this scum to not trifle with the titans' creations.Freya's Pact^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^Listen to what the Avatar of Freya has to say.^The cultists have been taken care of, but the Scourge's invasion has not slowed down. The situation is becoming desperate, <name>. There exists a last resort. Before I reveal any more, however, I must be sure I have your absolute trust.The Leaders at Jin'Alai^77^All^Zul'Drak^Scalper Ahunae^Scalper Ahunae^The Leaders at Jin'Alai^^The Frozen Earth^Scalper Ahunae at Zim'Torga has asked you to retrieve the Treasure of Kutube'sa, the Treasure of Gawanil, and the Treasure of Chulo the Mad.^You thinkin' what Ahunae thinkin', mon? Some of the Drakkari trolls have gathered at the Pools of Jin'Alai to the southwest. We be needin' to draw out their leaders, and Ahunae knows just how you be doin' it, too! Go in there and kill those trolls. When you kill enough, their leaders show up. When they show up next to their totems, you make sure to be gettin' the treasure of Kutube'sa, Gawanil, and Chulo the Mad, mon.To the Witch Doctor^77^All^Zul'Drak^Hexxer Ubungo^Witch Doctor Khufu^Too Much of a Good Thing^^^Speak with Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga.^We Zandalari could use your help, <name>. We must put an end to what the Drakkari are doing to their gods! To the northeast, up the great steps that lead to the next tier of Zul'Drak, lies Zim'Torga. It is the home to another of the god statues and a refuge that my people are desparately attempting to defend. I would like for you to travel there and speak to Witch Doctor Khufu. Be warned though, the place is under constant attack from the Drakkari.It Could Be Anywhere!^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Chad^Chad^^^^Look for a Golden Engagement Ring on the various creatures in Sholazar Basin.^When I found out that Miss Boulian was helping Nesingwary with his expedition, I signed up as a deckhand immediately. You see, I'd been meaning to marry her for months! I had it all planned out. I was going to propose the very night of the shipwreck... but now the ring is gone. I've searched everywhere! I know it might sound crazy, but I know the engagement ring is in the Basin. If some Venture Company didn't steal it, maybe a wild creature ate it. But it's here somewhere... I just know it!Breaking Through Jin'Alai^77^All^Zul'Drak^Witch Doctor Khufu^Witch Doctor Khufu^Too Much of a Good Thing^^To Speak With Har'koa^Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga has asked you to disturb the Blue Cauldron, Green Cauldron, Purple Cauldron, and Red Cauldron.^I have been trying to commune with the gods. However, the medicine men at the Pools of Jin'Alai are performing rituals that are interfering with my attempts. It is imperative that we break through their obtrusion. If you were to head southwest into the pools area, I am certain that you would come across the cauldrons they are using for their magic. Disturb each of the cauldrons to bring down their ritual that is blocking me.To Speak With Har'koa^77^All^Zul'Drak^Witch Doctor Khufu^Har'koa^To Speak With Har'koa^Breaking Through Jin'Alai^^Speak with Har'koa at the Altar of Har'koa.^The gods have spoken, <name>. We now know what you must do. You must now go to the Altar of Har'koa to the southeast and speak with the leopard goddess.You Can Run, But You Can't Hide^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan in Ebon Watch asked you to go to the Reliquary of Agony to collect 5 Putrid Abomination Guts from the Putrid Abominations and 5 Gooey Ghoul Drools.^Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it. You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse.... <Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin.> ... unless we can use their desires against them. I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components. Travel due east of here to the Reliquary of Agony. Slay abominations and gather the ghoul drool you'll find there then return to me with their remnants.Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^In Search Of Answers^^Taking a Stand^Stefan in Ebon Watch wants you to use Nass to collect 10 hair samples from Withered Trolls.^Before you meet Nass, there's something you should know. He got a toxic dose of blight back in the day, and now he's deaf, blind, and mostly numb. It's not all bad, though. He's virtually immune to the stuff now, which makes him perfect for certain tasks - like the one I'm about to give you. There are many freshly scourged trolls nearby and we need to study the blight's effect on them. Take Nass, and this boot. When you've slain a troll, give him a good kick and he'll know to take a hair sample.An Invitation, of Sorts...^75^All^Zul'Drak^Unliving Choker^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Take the Unliving Choker to Stefan at Ebon Watch.^Crafted of bone and dripping with blood, this choker is of intricate and deliberate design. Gazing upon it overwhelms you with an ominous presence - one that compels you to wear it. You fight the urge, and resolve to bring it back to Ebon Watch. If anyone can explain this, a death knight can....But First My Offspring^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Har'koa^To Speak With Har'koa^^Spirit of Rhunok, The Blessing of Zim'Rhuk^Har'koa has asked you to use her whisker on the corpses of her children to free and resurrect them. Return to her at the Altar of Har'koa when you are done.^I am the last of the gods to be subdued, so we must first attempt to free the others. Bound by the magics of my subduers, I am unable to discern their fates. But first, I would ask that you do me a kindness. Already the Drakkari turn my magic against me. They have transformed my offspring into monstrosities. Take one of my whiskers. Slay my tortured children and use the magic of it to release them from their nightmare, and bring them back to life.Darkness Calling^75^All^Zul'Drak^Writhing Choker^Stefan Vadu^Darkness Calling^Cleansing Drak'Tharon^^Take the Writhing Choker to Stefan in Ebon Watch.^Crafted of bone and dripping with blood, this choker is of intricate and deliberate design. Gazing upon it overwhelms you with an ominous presence - one that compels you to wear it. You fight the urge, and resolve to bring it back to Ebon Watch. If anyone can explain this, a death knight can....Some Make Lemonade, Some Make Liquor^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Grimbooze Thunderbrew^Grimbooze Thunderbrew^Some Make Lemonade, Some Make Liquor^^^Bring 1 Orange, 2 Banana Bunches, and 1 Papaya to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^Life's tossed me a cartload of lemons this time! When the ship ran aground, the kegs carrying my best brew burst! All we have now are a few bottles of rum, and it won't sustain a thirsty expedition! We need to get some booze cooking, and fast!! The trees in the Wildgrowth Mangal, to the east, seem laden with fruit, but it's too high for me to reach. Look for good, strong vines, see if you can use it to shake some of that fruit out of the trees. Bring me whatever you can find.Relics of the Snow Leopard Goddess^77^All^Zul'Drak^Chronicler To'kini^Chronicler To'kini^^^Plundering Their Own, Tails Up^Chronicler To'kini at Zim'Torga wants you to recover 10 Har'koan Relics.^I overheard that you are going to see to the well-being of Har'koa. Good luck to you. I am wondering if while you are in the vicinity of the altar, you would be willing to recover their relics? I do not require many, and it is only a short trip to the southeast. What do you say?The Eye Of Acherus^55^All^Death Knight^Instructor Razuvious^The Lich King^In Service Of The Lich King^^^Report to the Lich King in Ebon Hold.^Behold, Acherus, the grand citadel of death! It has no equal in this world! Not even the mighty Naxxramas could withstand a direct assault from the Ebon Hold. Looming above the face of the necropolis is the all-seeing eye of Acherus. From it the master is able to see great distances into the territories held by our enemies. What the eye sees, the Lich King sees, and now the time has come for you to peer through the eye! The Lich King has called for you, <name>. Go now! Suffer well, <brother/sister>...Near Miss^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to take the Unliving Choker to Bloodrose Datura.^It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>. Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurance. You've been targeted by someone, or something.... Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you.Close Call^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^Darkness Calling^^^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to take the Writhing Choker to Bloodrose Datura.^It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>. Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurence. You've been targeted by someone, or something.... Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you.The Frozen Earth^77^All^Zul'Drak^Element-Tamer Dagoda^Element-Tamer Dagoda^^The Leaders at Jin'Alai^^Element-Tamer Dagoda at Zim'Torga wants you to collect 7 Essence of the Frozen Earth.^We captured these elementals from nearby, and I have plenty of defenders now. But, it takes a great deal of power to make them strong enough to stand up to our enemies. The frozen earth at Drak'Mabwa to the northwest have what I need to maintain our defenses. I'll need more of their essence if I'm to keep this up.Sealing the Rifts^77^All^Zul'Drak^Scalper Ahunae^Scalper Ahunae^The Leaders at Jin'Alai^^^Scalper Ahunae at Zim'Torga has asked you to seal 7 Elemental Rifts.^Dagoda gonna be sendin' you northwest to Drak'Mabwa to get her more stuff for her defenders if she didn't already. While you up there, Ahunae be wantin' you to destroy the rifts those elementals pourin' out of. The last thing we needin' is for them to attack us! Just watch out, more of those frozen earth'll show up when you try to seal the rifts.Death Comes From On High^55^All^Death Knight^The Lich King^The Lich King^In Service Of The Lich King^^^The Lich King commands you to use the Eye of Acherus to analyze the Scarlet Hold, New Avalon Forge, New Avalon Town Hall and the Chapel of the Crimson Flame.^Towering above this platform is the eye of Acherus. From it you will call forth a probe that you will then use to analyze Scarlet Crusade fortifications at New Avalon. The eye has a host of powers that should make the acquisition of this data simple. Use the eye's siphon to analyze the forge, town hall, hold, and chapel. The eye's control mechanisms are located on either side of this platform. Waste no more time, <name>. The Scourge will have this place. The Lich King commands it!Spirit of Rhunok^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Spirit of Rhunok^Spirit of Rhunok^But First My Offspring^^Speak with the Spirit of Rhunok at the Altar of Rhunok.^My feelings tell me that Rhunok doesn't have much time. I can tell that the arctic bear god's spirit has already separated from his weakened body. It is his spirit with which you must commune. His altar lies to the northwest beyond Drak'Mabwa.Silver Lining^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^Darkness Calling^^^Stefan in Ebon Watch asked you to go to the Reliquary of Agony to collect 5 Putrid Abomination Guts from the Putrid Abominations and 5 Gooey Ghoul Drools.^Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it. You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse.... <Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin.> ... unless we can use their desires against them. I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components. Travel due east of here to the land beneath the Reliquary of Agony. Slay the ghouls and abominations you'll find there and return to me with their remnants.Still At It^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Grimbooze Thunderbrew^Grimbooze Thunderbrew^Some Make Lemonade, Some Make Liquor^^^Successfully complete the distillation process and bring the completed Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^Now that we've got the raw materials, I've had my assistant ready the still. He'll oversee the process, but I want you to help keep everything under control. You might be tempted to think that we just throw everything into the still and let it sit, but you're wrong. Ingredients and heat need to be added at certain times, and the pressure regulated at others. You'll have no more than 10 seconds to react to a situation. Speak with "Tipsy" McManus when you're ready to start distilling.The Taste Test^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Grimbooze Thunderbrew^Grimbooze Thunderbrew^Some Make Lemonade, Some Make Liquor^^Fletcher's Lost and Found^Offer a sample of Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch to Hemet Nesingwary, Hadrius Harlowe, and Tamara Wobblesprocket, then return to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^And now for the moment of truth! <Grimbooze chuckles.> I've always wanted to say that. Normally, I'd debut a new drink at a banquet, but we can't have one in the middle of the jungle. Instead, just take samples to a few trusted friends and return with their comments. Let's see, we'll definitely want Hemet Nesingwary's opinion, and Hadrius Harlowe's, too. They're here in camp. You'll want to head over to Lakeside Landing, near the center of the Basin and offer Tamara Wobblesprocket a taste.My Prophet, My Enemy^77^All^Zul'Drak^Spirit of Rhunok^Spirit of Rhunok^Spirit of Rhunok^^^The Spirit of Rhunok at the Altar of Rhunok has asked you to acquire his Arctic Bear God Mojo.^My prophet absorbed too much of my power too quickly, and subsequently killed himself. You can see the results at the water-filled crater to the south in Drak'Mabwa. My former priests have already resurrected him so that he can finish the job. They're channeling my power back into him, and it will not be long now before he reawakens. You must put an end to him and return with my mojo before it is too late.An End to the Suffering^77^All^Zul'Drak^Spirit of Rhunok^Spirit of Rhunok^Spirit of Rhunok^^^The Spirit of Rhunok has asked you to use the Tormentor's Incense to awaken his body. You are then to slay Rhunok using the power that his spirit has imbued you with.^My body is too far gone now, <name>. It is only a matter of time before a new prophet is elevated and finishes what the other began. I am going to imbue you with the last of my power. The tormentor inside the altar building carries incense, which will awaken my body and make it vulnerable. Use the incense and do me the kindness of putting an end to my suffering. I apologize if I fight back. Even for me, the will to survive is strong.Dressing Down^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^Infiltrating Voltarus^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to use the Ensorceled Choker to apply the Scourge disguise.^There... I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge. You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the blightguards will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them! Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert. Let's test it out. Use the choker and visit the Scourge merchant just east of here. Return to me with a bottle of bitter plasma.Suit Up!^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^Darkness Calling^^Infiltrating Voltarus, Reunited^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to use the Ensorcelled Choker to apply the Scourge disguise.^There... I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge. You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the blightguards will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them! Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert. Let's test it out. Use the choker and visit the Scourge vendor just east of here. Return to me with a bottle of bitter plasma.Plundering Their Own^77^All^Zul'Drak^Chronicler To'kini^Chronicler To'kini^^Relics of the Snow Leopard Goddess^^Chronicler To'kini at Zim'Torga wants you to recover 7 Rhunokian Artifacts.^There is another altar nearby where there are artifacts to be saved. It is said that the Drakkari at the Altar of Rhunok to the northwest, beyond the broken tundra of Drak'Mabwa, have already plundered their own holy site. <class>, I would be appreciative if you could rescue those artifacts from their undeserving hands.Lakeside Landing^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Hemet Nesingwary^Tamara Wobblesprocket^^The Great Hunter's Challenge^^Speak with Tamara Wobblesprocket at Lakeside Landing.^When the trouble with the Venture Company started, I asked Marvin Wobblesprocket and his wife, Tamara, to take their flying machines east to River's Heart. I asked them to setup a small camp there so that we could use them as a relay to fly in supplies and survey the area. They should have arrived by now and started setting up. River's Heart is near the center of the basin where the rivers converge. Search for Lakeshore Landing on the northeast shore. Marvin mentioned it would be the best spot.Feedin' Da Goolz^75^ ^Zul'Drak^Gristlegut^Gristlegut^^^^Gristlegut at the Reliquary of Agony wants you to use Bowels and Brains Bowl next to 10 Decaying Ghouls.^Git o'er heer, gool! Yeh, I talkin' to yoo. It feedin' time now. Gotta git da grub ta all da gools! Speshal grub dis time! Bowels an' brainz bowl... num, num, num. Jus drop da bowl nexta da gool. Gud way ta make frenz. Yoo got goolfrenz? Ha, ha, hah!Back to Har'koa^77^All^Zul'Drak^Spirit of Rhunok^Har'koa^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Speak with Har'koa at the Altar of Har'koa.^And now it is time for you to return to the leopard goddess. Somehow I sense that she has other plans for you. Tell her that no matter what, we are eternal.The Part-time Hunter^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Tamara Wobblesprocket^Tamara Wobblesprocket^^^^Bring Pitch's Remains to Tamara Wobblesprocket at Lakeside Landing.^When Hemet asked me to accompany Marvin out here, I hoped that I might have the opportunity to work on my own hunting skills in between repairing the flying machines and setting up the camp. I wanted to take down a ferocious lion named Pitch. He's said to make his home south of here, near where the Wildgrowth Mangal meets the northern face of the Skyreach Pillar. If you can find the beast, would you bring back his remains? If the rumors are true, they'd make a trophy even Hemet will respect!The Blessing of Zim'Rhuk^77^All^Zul'Drak^Witch Doctor Khufu^Zim'Rhuk^^But First My Offspring^Blessing of Zim'Rhuk^Witch Doctor Khufu wants you to present 10 Drakkari Offerings to the statue of Zim'Rhuk.^There is another god of Zul'Drak that is being neglected. Zim'Rhuk's statue lies directly to the north. Known as "The Wise One", Zim'Rhuk is also known to be very protective of his domain. He maintains guardians that deal harshly with anyone that does not have the wits to slip past them. Avoid the guardians and give the Drakkari offerings to Zim'Rhuk so that you will benefit from his blessing.The Might Of The Scourge^55^All^Death Knight^The Lich King^Highlord Darion Mograine^In Service Of The Lich King^^The Power Of Blood, Frost And Unholy^The Lich King commands you to carry his orders to Highlord Darion Mograine at Ebon Hold.^Listen well, death knight, for I give to you the words that will start a war. My final judgment has been passed: Death. To. All. None shall stand so boldly against the might of the Scourge without reprisal! As you have served me well in your first task, so too shall you serve me in your next task. Take my judgment to Highlord Mograine at the command post of Acherus, found on the first floor. Tell him to begin the assault. And when the Crusade has been dealt with, we will finish off the Argent Dawn.My Pet Roc^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Zootfizzle^Zootfizzle^^Sharpening Your Talons^^Bring 7 Roc Eggs to Zootfizzle at Dorian's Outpost.^Dorian's had me training and feeding the baby drakes he captures, and it has gotten me thinking. I want a pet of my own! No, not a juvenile drake. I don't want a pet capable of biting my hand off! However, in the Bonefields to the northeast of the camp, beyond the area dominated by the drakes, there's a large population of goretalon rocs. The grown ones are beyond hope of domesticating, but if you bring me the eggs from their nests, I can raise them from the time they hatch.Scalps!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Scalper Ahunae^Scalper Ahunae^The Leaders at Jin'Alai^^^Scalper Ahunae at Zim'Torga wants you to use Ahunae's Knife to scalp 10 Heb'Drakkar trolls.^I thinkin' it be time to do some scalpin', mon! The trolls at Heb'Drakkar to the northeast should do nicely. With their fancy bats and attackin' us, they got it comin'! Ahunae even give you his own knife so that you do the job right.Weapons of Destruction^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^^Cultist Incursion^^The Avatar of Freya wants you to go to the Death's Hand Encampment to the northwest and destroy 4 Unstable Explosives.^The Lich King's lackeys have dared to bring weapons of destruction into my domain. I will not stand for this. Go to their outpost to the north and destroy the weapons they would use against the land. We cannot let the Scourge taint another inch of these sacred lands.Infiltrating Voltarus^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan wants you to use your Ensorcelled Choker to get into Voltarus and do whatever the Scourge leader there asks of you.^By now you've probably guessed the details of my plan. We're using the Scourge's interest in you against them. You're going undercover. I know it's likely a death sentence, but if we do nothing your death is a certainty. Travel northeast to Reliquary of Pain and stand on the platform while wearing your disguise. Once inside Voltarus, you must earn the trust of the Scourge commander. When you've completed your mission, blow this horn and I'll fly to your location to receive your report.Bringing Down Heb'Jin^77^All^Zul'Drak^Element-Tamer Dagoda^Element-Tamer Dagoda^^^^Element-Tamer Dagoda at Zim'Torga wants you to kill Heb'Jin.^<Dagoda looks at Ahunae and sighs.> You want to really deal with Heb'Drakkar? Collecting scalps isn't going to get the job done. You have to take out their leader, Heb'Jin. The problem is, he's up on the bat rookery goading his forces on. Bang his drum and I guarantee that he'll fly down. That's when you kill him. You can take this net we got from one of his headhunters. Use it to trap his bat when he lands. That way you won't have to fight both of them.Reunited^75^All^Zul'Drak^Overlord Drakuru^Overlord Drakuru^^Suit Up!^^Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to speak to Gorebag and take the tour of Zul'Drak.^<name>! Ya musta received mah gift! Turn around, mon, lemme get a good look at ya... Ahh, ya make me proud. We come such a long way, you and I, and now we be servin' da Lich King together. Stick with me and big things be comin, mon. Big things... but first, we need to be gettin' ya caught up. So much been happenin' since I saw ya last. Go speak ta Gorebag for a tour of Zul'Drak. Listen for me and I'll tell ya all ya be needin' ta know.Dark Horizon^75^All^Zul'Drak^Overlord Drakuru^Overlord Drakuru^^^^Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to speak to Gorebag and take the tour of Zul'Drak.^Ahh, another supplicant answerin' da Lich King's call. <Drakuru sniffs you.> Freshly scourged, eh? Ya still be reekin' of da living! Long be da line of dem who seek da Lich King's blessings. Ya must rise above da masses and prove yerself worthy of wieldin' true power. Lookin' down over Zul'Drak, I sensed potential in ya. I ordered your - invitation. Da rest be up ta you.... Go an' speak ta Gorebag for a tour of Zul'Drak. Dere be much ta do if you're to be of any worth to me.I Sense a Disturbance^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Har'koa^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Har'koa has asked you to determine what has happened to Quetz'lun. Speak to her to be able to ride one of her children stealthily into the Altar of Quetz'lun.^There's something wrong with Quetz'lun, the wind serpent goddess. What it is exactly I cannot sense, but I do know that her altar has been overrun with powerful creatures. I'm going to send you there on the back of one of my children, which you saved. The two of you will move swiftly and with great stealth to uncover what has become of Quetz'lun. My child will see you safely back to me. Just keep your eyes open. When you are ready, ask and I will call one of my kittens for you.Preparations for the Underworld^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Har'koa^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Har'koa wants you to collect 8 Sacred Adornments. Deliver them to her at the Altar of Har'koa.^Quetz'lun may be dead, but I can still feel her spirit lingering in the underworld at the altar. We have to find a way to get you to her. Luckily for us, I just happen to have a supply of former supplicants at hand who are no longer in need of their sacred adornments. Both my subduers and claws are likely to still be wearing them. Bring the adornments to me and I'll draw upon their energy to enable you to cross over into Quetz'lun's underworld nightmare.Seek the Wind Serpent Goddess^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Seek Quetz'lun's Spirit at the Altar of Quetz'lun.^You are prepared, but I'm not certain that you're ready for what is to come. When you cross back over into Quetz'lun's altar area, you will enter the realm of the dead. From what I can feel of it, it's not going to be pleasant. Try not to be distracted by what you see in there. Simply head for the altar building and seek out Quetz'lun's Spirit.Foundation for Revenge^77^All^Zul'Drak^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Quetz'lun's Spirit has tasked you with the destruction of 12 trolls, either Quetz'lun Worshippers or Serpent-Touched Berserkers, near her Soul Fonts.^I have something special planned for my favorite high priests. But first you get to prove yourself in laying the foundation for my revenge. You do still want to live, yes? As you have seen, my devotees are enjoying their stay here, but now it's time for them to make final restitution. Do me the smallest of favors if you would, <name>. Lure them near my soul fonts and then put an end to their existences. They taste so delicious, and their sacrifice will not go in vain, I can assure you.So Far, So Bad^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to return to Drakuru and complete any tasks he has for you.^Everything you've reported is consistent with what we know. Learning of Drakuru and earning his trust will lay the groundwork for your future missions. Return to him and do as he says. Do whatever you must to appear sincere, <name>. A great deal is riding upon your performance. This time I'm adding an additional assignment: While you're in the field, pour this additive into their blight cauldrons. It should neutralize the scourging agent and render the batch useless.The Scarlet Harvest^55^All^Death Knight^Scourge Commander Thalanor^Prince Valanar^In Service Of The Lich King^^Tonight We Dine In Havenshire, Grand Theft Palomino, Abandoned Mail, Death's Challenge^Report to Prince Valanar at Death's Breach.^Below Acherus stands Death's Breach, the staging point for our assault upon the Scarlet Crusade. You are to ride one of my Scourge gryphons, located on either side of this platform, and report to Prince Valanar. Do as he says and you may live to see these lands fall before us.Reconnaissance Flight^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Pilot Vic^Pilot Vic^An Embarassing Incident^^^Help Pilot Vic complete the Reconnaissance Flight.^It's about time we had planes up and running in this place. The professor's been asking me to check out a strange weather pattern coming from the northeast. Thing is, I'm going to need a co-pilot if we're going into uncharted territory. No way in hell I'm heading out there alone. What do you say, <tough-guy /hotshot>? You might learn a thing or two. And once you learn to deal with the northern winds... you can pretty much fly anywhere.Setting the Stage^77^All^Zul'Drak^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Quetz'lun's Spirit has demanded that you collect 10 Underworld Power Fragments. Return to her at the Altar of Quetz'lun only when you have done so.^I will give you a chance at continued existence. There are fragments of the power that fueled my curse scattered about the altar grounds. It is my desire that you collect some of them for me. Not so many that the curse will be lifted, but enough that I will be able to eventually make use of them to exact revenge upon my prophet. Go, insect. Run and do my bidding before I change my mind about letting you live.It Rolls Downhill^75^All^Zul'Drak^Overlord Drakuru^Overlord Drakuru^^^^Overlord Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to use the Scepter of Suggestion on the Blight Geists and then order them to harvest 7 Blight Crystals.^If ya ever gonna be worthy of da Lich King's gifts, ya must learn ta be a great leader - one who be commandin' respect! I got a task dat gonna refine your command skills, mon.... Summa my minions be trained ta harvest blight crystals from da land below, but dey be lazy and slow. You gonna be in charge o' dem, mon. Take dis scepter and teach 'em how to get da job done. When dey be under your control, make 'em harvest dem crystals!Hell Hath a Fury^77^All^Zul'Drak^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Quetz'lun's Spirit at the Altar of Quetz'lun wants you to use Quetz'lun's Hexxing Stick upon High Priest Mu'funu, High Priestess Tua-Tua, and High Priest Hawinni. Once you have done this, slay them.^It is now time for you to punish my three high priests: Mu'funu, Tua-Tua, and Hawinni. You'll find them spread around the altar grounds. Take this hexxing stick. I've empowered it with my rage and indignation. I'm sure that it will prove potent. Just use it and proceed to destroy them. The hex will take care of the rest. <Quetz'lun displays a toothy grin.> Succeed and I may let you go. Fail and die.One Last Thing^77^All^Zul'Drak^Quetz'lun's Spirit^Har'koa^Spirit of Rhunok^^^Deliver the Underworld Power Fragments to Har'koa and beseech her for a portion of her spirit. You will still find her at the Altar of Har'koa.^There is one last thing that is needed to enact the final revenge against my prophet. The power fragments you collected must be imbued with a portion of a living gods' spirit. You're going to need to beseech Har'koa for some of hers. Once you've done that, when you return here, you will not come to the underworld. Instead, you will return to the physical world of my altar. My children and guardians will no longer attack you, and you'll be able to get to my prophet without having to worry about them.Sabotage^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to perform another task for Drakuru.^While we're working to discover the purpose of these crystals, we need you back in Voltarus doing Drakuru's bidding. Every task you perform successfully gets you closer to him, and brings us that much nearer to knowing his mind. While you're there, I have another mission for you. Drakuru's Scourgewagons pose a significant threat. We need them destroyed. Make your way to the wagons and activate these charges. Once they're set, get clear! The explosion will expose you if you're too close.Hazardous Materials^75^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan at Ebon Watch wants you to go to Voltarus and complete any tasks Drakuru has for you. While there, you are to steal 5 Harvested Blight Crystals.^Blight crystals?! What could this scumbag Drakuru be up to? Clearly, he's working on something significant. Continue to do his bidding and perhaps once he's more familiar with you he'll reveal his plans. In the meantime, we need to have a look at these crystals. While you're in Voltarus, try to get some samples of the harvested crystals when no one's looking. Be alert! Handling those crystals can trigger your disguise to fail.If Chaos Drives, Let Suffering Hold The Reins^55^All^Death Knight^Prince Valanar^Prince Valanar^In Service Of The Lich King^^Gothik the Harvester^Prince Valanar at Death's Breach commands you to slay 10 Scarlet Crusaders or Scarlet Peasants and 10 Citizens of Havenshire.^They make their stand now, outside of Death's Breach, futilely attempting to push us back in hopes of saving their horses, mines, lumber and citizens. This will be your first lesson in Scourge warfare: TERROR! Go to the front lines, south of here, and destroy Scarlet Crusaders. Leave their corpses so that we may utilize them for the death march. But most importantly: kill the fleeing villagers. Soldiers dying are an affordance, but villagers? That is what strikes fear into the hearts of man.Tonight We Dine In Havenshire^55^All^Death Knight^Orithos the Sky Darkener^Orithos the Sky Darkener^^The Scarlet Harvest^Gothik the Harvester^Orithos the Sky Darkener at Death's Breach wants you to recover 15 Saronite Arrows.^The Sky Darkeners are mindless constructs with one purpose: KILL! Specifically, they are aiming to kill any man or woman that they see fleeing Havenshire for the safety of New Avalon. We certainly can't allow those cowards to make it to safety and then take up arms against us! There is one slight problem. They use saronite arrows for maximum range and damage. Saronite, however, is a metal only found in Northrend, so supplies are limited! Retrieve those arrows for me and I will reward you handsomely.Grand Theft Palomino^55^All^Death Knight^Salanar the Horseman^Salanar the Horseman^Grand Theft Palomino^The Scarlet Harvest^^Salanar the Horseman asks that you steal a horse from the Havenshire Stables and return it to him at Death's Breach.^How fortuitous it is that the Crusade has a stable full of horses a mere stone's throw from this post. Though they guard it tenaciously, an enterprising young death knight could break through their defenses and take what is rightfully <his/hers>! Once you acquire a horse from the Havenshire Stables, return it to me and I will see what can be done about transforming it into a proper deathcharger. Remember, <name>, it's only stealing if you're caught. Watch out for that deranged stable master, Kitrik!Reagent Agent^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Colvin Norrington^Colvin Norrington^^Sharpening Your Talons^^Bring 5 Twisted Roc Claws to Colvin Norrington at Dorian's Outpost.^That Archmage Pentarus, back in Dalaran, will be expecting us to return with all kinds of reagents and talismans. It seems the locals are fond of animal parts. Twisted claws from the goretalon rocs are among their favorite. It's not my place to say whether the rumors are true or not, but I've a feeling there's something here. The rocs live in the Bonefields off to the northeast, where they feed on the corpses of old mammoths. Will you help me gather talons for the archmage's research?Burning to Help^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Colvin Norrington^Colvin Norrington^^Sharpening Your Talons^^Colvin Norrington at Dorian's Outpost wants you to take 5 Hydra Sputum Samples and kill 5 Bittertide Hydra.^There's no more caustic material in all of the basin than bittertide hydra sputum. I've got special containers to collect just such a thing for Archmage Pentarus' studies. Now all I need is a brave, um... collector. You look like a hardy, adventurous <class>. How'd you like to make a bit of money and aid Dalaran's cause at the same time? All you need to do is take this container with you to Bittertide Lake, to the southwest. Engage the hydra and use the container to sample the sputum they shower you with.Blood of a Dead God^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Har'koa^Spirit of Rhunok^^You Reap What You Sow^Har'koa has asked you to collect 7 Blood of Mam'toth. Return them to her at the Altar of Har'koa.^Mam'toth, the god of the mammoths, destroyed himself, and took much of his temple with him, rather than allowing his trolls to gain his power. If I'm to sacrifice a portion of my spirit, I will need something with which to bolster myself. Mam'toth left behind an enormous crater to the northeast, just north of the Altar of Quetz'lun. Within the crater his blood yet lives. Bring it to me.You Reap What You Sow^77^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Witch Doctor Khufu^^Blood of a Dead God^Wooly Justice, Enchanted Tiki Warriors, Hexed Caches, The Key of Warlord Zol'Maz^Slay the Drained Prophet of Quetz'lun and then inform Witch Doctor Khufu at Zim'Torga.^This is what it has come down to... revenge. <Har'koa sighs.> Take this ritual kit and enact it near Quetz'lun's corpse upon her altar.

The Crusade is in a frenzy. They have diverted all forces outside of New Avalon to set up a blockade at Light's Point, east of here. They are desperately trying to strip the Havenshire Mine of all resources and load the cargo aboard the frigates they have docked on the coast. Let's stir things up a bit, shall we? Gothik the Harvester, grand necromancer of the Lich King, has graced us with his presence. He has a gift he'd like to bestow upon the Scarlet Crusade.

Report to him at once!Massacre At Light's Point^55^All^Death Knight^Prince Valanar^Prince Valanar^Gothik the Harvester^^^Prince Valanar at Death's Breach has commanded you to slaughter 100 Scarlet Defenders.^In their haste the Crusade will make one fatal error: forgetting to check the mine cars. You are to return to Havenshire Mine, east of here, and locate the mine car that my minions have planted near the outhouse. Climb inside the mine car and a Scarlet miner will unwittingly see to it that you are placed safely behind enemy lines. Once aboard one of their ships, use the cannons against them!

While you're there, I need you to deal with the warlord's special guardians. The enchanted tiki warriors, as they're called, represent a very real threat.

Let's you and I demonstrate that they're not worth the effort to create, shall we?Hexed Caches^77^All^Zul'Drak^Chronicler To'kini^Chronicler To'kini^^You Reap What You Sow^^Chronicler To'kini at Zim'Torga has asked you to acquire 12 Zol'Maz Stronghold Caches.^Pardon me, <name>. I'm given to understand that you might be heading northeast up to the Zol'Maz Stronghold. Such a trip presents a great opportunity for us to conclude our Drakkari goods gathering. As I have come to know, the Drakkari warlord is extremely paranoid. He's had all of his caches at the stronghold hexed with dire magic. Rumor has it that his tiki warriors carry the cure, but who can say? If you could find the time to acquire some of those goods, I would be most appreciative.Disclosure^75^All^Zul'Drak^Overlord Drakuru^Overlord Drakuru^Fuel for the Fire^^^Drakuru in Voltarus wants you to take the teleporter to his upper chamber.^Ya doin' well, <name>.

Even now he is being prepared for the slaughter. The Drakkari warlord, Zol'Maz, carries the key. Hearing of your exploits, he has secluded himself and his family at their stronghold up the steps to the northeast. The warlord is strong and you will need help. If you were to combine the tiki, sword and incantation of his family members, you would be able to summon such help as you challenge him before his home's gate.Betrayal^76^All^Zul'Drak^Stefan Vadu^Stefan Vadu^An Invitation, of Sorts...^^^Stefan in Ebon Watch wants you to defeat Drakuru.^The time has come to end this charade, <name>.

Fight well.The Will Of The Lich King^55^All^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^Prince Valanar^Gothik the Harvester^^^Return to Death's Breach and report to Prince Valanar.^It is the will of the Lich King that drives us onward, <name>. None are more aware of this than death knights. Our very existence is intrinsically tied to his consciousness. Surely you have heard him speak to you - invading your thoughts... Can you hear him now?

The Lich King commands it!The Crypt of Remembrance^55^All^Death Knight^Prince Valanar^Prince Keleseth^Gothik the Harvester^^Lambs To The Slaughter^Report to Prince Keleseth at the Crypt of Remembrance.^The attacks upon the gates of the last Scarlet bastion have begun.

Notice anything missing? Of course you don't, because you're a moron! Your brain was probably the first thing to die. <Noth sighs.> I have been commanded to put together a plague cauldron. You will help me. Directly inside the gate of New Avalon is the inn. Enter the inn and steal an empty cauldron. Then go to the forge, also near the gate, and steal some iron chains. Bring those back to me along with 10 Crusader skulls. Do I need to tell you where to get those too?Noth's Special Brew^55^All^Death Knight^Noth the Plaguebringer^Plague Cauldron^The Plaguebringer's Request^^More Skulls For Brew^Place the Pile of Crusader Skulls inside the Plague Cauldron.^The cauldron is ready to begin spewing its foul corruption across the land! Now, death knight, a brief lesson in plague cauldrons. The gas that the cauldron emits is deadly to the living, but empowers Scourge. As with all Scourge creations, it feeds off of death and grows stronger the longer it feeds. Take these Crusader skulls and drop them in the cauldron. You will be quite happy with the results.Nowhere To Run And Nowhere To Hide^55^All^Death Knight^Prince Keleseth^Prince Keleseth^Gothik the Harvester^^^Prince Keleseth at the Crypt of Remembrance has ordered you to kill Mayor Quimby and recover the New Avalon Registry.^Nothing less than total annihilation will suffice, <name>. To that end, a few hundred mindless ghouls assaulting the front gate of New Avalon will not do. We must infiltrate the inner sanctum and dispose of their officials. They must be shown that no one can escape the Scourge's grasp! Make your way to the New Avalon Town Hall, southwest of here, and assassinate the mayor. Search the building for the New Avalon registry and bring it to me.How To Win Friends And Influence Enemies^55^All^Death Knight^Prince Keleseth^Prince Keleseth^Gothik the Harvester^^Behind Scarlet Lines^Prince Keleseth at the Crypt of Remembrance has ordered you to discover the truth about the "Crimson Dawn."^In my travels across this world I have made several interesting discoveries. For instance, did you know that with the proper amount of encouragement one can extract all the truths that a man dares hide? As luck would have it, I happen to have some encouragement on hand. <Keleseth pulls something out of an ornately jeweled box.> These are my "persuaders." Equip them and take to the field, death knight. Apply the pointy ends to the soldiers of New Avalon.

You must take the key and use it to unlock Akali. He is being held in the courtyard in front of Gundrak, the capital of Zul'Drak. Akali's chains are secured by four anchor points. You must unlock each of them to set the rhino god free. Gundrak is teeming with ice trolls. However, I believe that if you're careful, you should be able to slip in without too much danger. Once you're done, please inform the witch doctor.Lambs To The Slaughter^55^All^Death Knight^Baron Rivendare^Baron Rivendare^^The Crypt of Remembrance^^Baron Rivendare at the Crypt of Remembrance has commanded you to slay 10 Scarlet Crusade Soldiers and 15 Citizens of New Avalon.^Most humans would have fled the moment a Scourge necropolis took up residence in their air space. Not the Scarlet Crusade! I must confess - I rather enjoy our exchanges with the Crusade. Through the years, Scourge battles against them have resulted in several of the most tragic events in human history. Yet here we stand - AGAIN - locked in battle! We shan't deny them the pleasures of eternal servitude to the Lich King! Enter New Avalon and fulfill their death wish. Leave no survivors.Behind Scarlet Lines^55^All^Death Knight^Prince Keleseth^Orbaz Bloodbane^Behind Scarlet Lines^How To Win Friends And Influence Enemies^Brothers In Death^Report to Orbaz Bloodbane at the Scarlet Tavern in New Avalon.^I have sent Orbaz, Thassarian and Koltira behind enemy lines to search for the courier.

None of these humans had an answer either. <Orbaz points to the Scarlet corpses strewn across the floor.> I did manage to beat something useful out of the last one. Inside Scarlet Hold they keep a schedule of all patrol routes. I want you to break into the hold and steal the schedule. The hold is the largest building in New Avalon - northeast of here.Brothers In Death^55^All^Death Knight^Thassarian^Koltira Deathweaver^Brothers In Death^Behind Scarlet Lines^^Search for Koltira Deathweaver in the Scarlet Hold.^Breaking through the Scarlet lines was no easy task. We suffered many casualties during the assault and lost one of our best death knights, Koltira Deathweaver. I don't know whether he's dead or alive, but I'll be damned if we don't search for him. I last saw him being bound in irons and dragged away to the Scarlet Hold, northeast of here. Tear that keep asunder, death knight. Find Koltira!Song of Wind and Water^80^All^Sholazar Basin^Oracle Soo-nee^Oracle Soo-nee^^Return of the Friendly Dryskin^^Soo-nee wants you to use the Tempest Drums at the Stormwright's Shelf and help Haiphoon devour 3 Storm Revenants and 3 Aqueous Spirits.^Listen to storm, yes?

The High Inquisitor and his acolytes will be here soon. I'm too badly injured to be of much use, but I'll do what little I can to help. Slay the High Inquisitor and his cronies. Tear off his head and return with it to Thassarian. Vengeance will soothe his savage soul. One more thing, <name>. If you do manage to survive and make it back to Thassarian, tell him that they're executing prisoners at the chapel. Perhaps he'll send you there to play the hero once more.Monitoring the Rift: Winterfin Cavern^71^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Garren^Librarian Garren^Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly^^^Librarian Garren at Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at Winterfin Caverns.^I need to compile my notes and prepare a presentation for my colleagues in Dalaran.

Gather friends to your side, <name>. Take them north to Zim'Rhuk to destroy guardians there until they yield the unblemished heart. Take them east to the Altar of Quetz'lun and disrupt the altar wardens until you recover their gusty essence. Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear.Convocation at Zol'Heb^78^All^Zul'Drak^Har'koa^Har'koa^The Gods Have Spoken^^Unfinished Business^Har'koa at Zim'Torga has asked you to slay the Prophet of Akali.^You and your friends must take this instrument of convocation - of summoning - to Zol'Heb just south of Gundrak.

We have been through much together, and you have done all that you can to not only save my life, but those of the other gods the Drakkari have destroyed. But I fear this time we may not see each other again until the afterlife.The Heartblood's Strength^80^All^Sholazar Basin^Rejek^Rejek^^Return of the Lich Hunter^^Bring a vial of Suntouched Heartblood to Rejek at Frenzyheart Hill.^One day, Rejek will be mighty warrior.

Far to northwest, there is large, flat area the big-tongues call 'Stormwright's Shelf.' Rejek is sure you can only get there by flying like bird. On this shelf, Rejek has heard of mighty forces of wind and water. Kill them for their badness, then take it to the big-tongue 'Shrine of the Tempest' at shelf's western side. Rejek will await your return with ultimate power.A Special Surprise^55^Human^Death Knight^Knight Commander Plaguefist^Knight Commander Plaguefist^A Special Surprise^A Cry For Vengeance!^A Sort Of Homecoming^Knight Commander Plaguefist at the Chapel of the Crimson Flame has ordered you to execute Ellen Stanbridge, an Argent Dawn prisoner inside the nearby prison house.^We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house.

Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing. I was about to go in there and execute the rest of them, but I think you should have the honors.

The Scarlet courier is scheduled to pass by the Scarlet Overlook within the hour. The roads by the overlook are wide open and swarming with Crusaders. Use this makeshift cover to hide at the overlook and wait for the Scarlet Courier to pass. When he's close enough, strike with all your fury! Cut him down and take his belongings - including his clothes! The overlook is 200 paces east of here.A Meeting With Fate^55^All^Death Knight^Orbaz Bloodbane^High General Abbendis^Ambush At The Overlook^^^Orbaz Bloodbane has commanded you to deliver the Scarlet Courier's Message to High General Abbendis at King's Harbor.^This message must reach Abbendis. We do not want to draw their suspicion. They must continue under the assumption that everything is going as they planned. You will don the Scarlet courier's clothes and with the help of some dark magic, take on the form of the courier. Abbendis is at King's Harbor, southeast of the Scarlet Overlook. Drop off the message and get as much information out of her as you can. She will tell us what we need to know about the "Crimson Dawn."The Scarlet Onslaught Emerges^55^All^Death Knight^High General Abbendis^Orbaz Bloodbane^Ambush At The Overlook^^^Deliver The Path of Redemption to Orbaz Bloodbane at the Scarlet Tavern in New Avalon.^Listen well, courier.

Return to Galvar with this message: "Turn your armies around and prepare your ships for travel to the frozen wastes. When next we meet it will be in Northrend." Give this to Galvar. <Abbendis hands you a journal.> It will explain everything. The Scarlet Crusade is no more. Long live the Scarlet Onslaught!Scarlet Armies Approach...^55^All^Death Knight^Orbaz Bloodbane^Highlord Darion Mograine^Ambush At The Overlook^^The Scarlet Apocalypse^Deliver The Path of Redemption to Highlord Darion Mograine at Acherus: The Ebon Hold.^We must prepare for the encroaching armies, <name>. You will take what you have discovered to Highlord Mograine at once! I will open a portal directly to Acherus. Step inside and it will transport you. Give Highlord Mograine Abbendis' journal as well. Perhaps he'll find it useful.A Hero's Headgear^80^All^Sholazar Basin^Rejek^Rejek^^Return of the Lich Hunter^^Get Venture Co. Explosives from any of the Venture Company units at Swindlegrin's Dig and use them to obtain a Stormwatcher's Head. Bring the Stomwatcher's Head to Rejek at Frenzyheart Hill.^Rejek hears tales of giant metal men on faraway Stormwright's Shelf. Far to northwest, outside basin's lip, you will find it. Imagine Rejek using heads of giant metal men as helmet. Make Rejek unstoppable! Make Rejek mighty! You get for Rejek, but metal head might not come off metal body easy. Maybe steal bombs from little green men and their friends at Swindlegrin's Dig near Suntouched Pillar? Use bombs to get head off metal body, then bring to Rejek.Tools of War^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Vekgar^Shaman Jakjek^^Return of the Lich Hunter^^Retrieve some of Zepik's traps from his stash in Kartak's Hold. Using the traps, slaughter 50 of the nearby Sparktouched Gorlocs, and then return to Shaman Jakjek in Kartak's Hold.^Zepik tell me that you maybe the best gorloc hunter he met... other than Zepik. Still big battle to southwest - you go help. Zepik keeps some of biggest, baddest traps in his stash at Kartak's Hold... told Vekgar to use them for battle, so you use them too. Go pick out any traps you want and kill lots of big-tongues. Lots and lots!Secret Strength of the Frenzyheart^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Vekgar^Shaman Jakjek^^Return of the Lich Hunter^^Using the secret Frenzyheart drink, slaughter 30 of the Sparktouched Gorlocs around Kartak's Hold.^Battle still going at Kartak hold... I think it time for you to learn big secret of Frenzyheart. We have berries we keep from other lands we came from... they not so special on their own, but mix them with drunk drinks and they make Frenzyheart super strong. You a Frenzyheart now... it time you get to be strong too. I give some drink, then you be super strong and you go smash all the spark big-tongues.Mastery of the Crystals^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Oracle Soo-dow^Lightningcaller Soo-met^^Return of the Friendly Dryskin^^Retrieve the crystal defenses at Sparktouched Haven and use them to kill 50 of the nearby Frenzyheart wolvar. When these tasks are complete, return to Lightningcaller Soo-met in Sparktouched Haven.^Sparktouched are still being attacked by puppy-men... we think they maybe not stop if we not make them stop. We have secret weapon though... we sent it out to Soo-met so he can use to protect all Oracles. Secret weapon is from Great Ones themselves... extra shiny crystals found inside sacred Great One temples. Be very careful... no break them. Crystals are in chest near shrine at Sparktouched Haven, in far southwest. You go use crystals to help Soo-met beat the puppy-men.Power of the Great Ones^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Oracle Soo-dow^Lightningcaller Soo-met^^Return of the Friendly Dryskin^^Charge the Dormant Polished Crystal at the exposed Lifeblood Pillar. Travel to Sparktouched Haven and use the power the crystal bestows to slaughter 30 of the nearby Frenzyheart wolvar, and then speak to Lightningcaller Soo-met in Sparktouched Haven.^We need to do something to stop puppy-men attacking Sparktouched Haven. Jaloot brought me very special crystal that he found in River's Heart... we seen only one like it before. The crystal not have power now, but the opened up lifeblood pillar should have energy to recharge it if you just bring it close. Once the crystal is charged, go to Sparktouched Haven in far southwest and let the crystal's energy make you big and strong. Then it time to kick some puppy-men butt.Shifting Priorities^75^Horde^Grizzly Hills^Scout Vor'takh^Sergeant Riannah^^^^Scout Vor'takh wants you to travel to Zul'Drak and report to Sergeant Riannah at Light's Breach.^As pressing as our needs are here, there's news from the lands to the north that cannot be ignored. I've just received a message from the Argent Crusade. It seems that scourge forces are gathering there and are threatening to overrun Zul'drak. Needless to say, <name>, if that were to happen our struggle here would be meaningless. You must go there and aid the Crusaders in beating back the Lich King's armies. Speak to Makki when you are ready to travel.Speak with your Ambassador^72^Alliance^Dragonblight^Tariolstrasz^Lauriel Trueblade^A Strange Device^^^Speak with Lauriel Trueblade at Wyrmrest Temple.^<The dragon in elf form takes your letter of introduction, perusing it for a moment and then stashing it away within his sleeve.> Everything seems to be in order. However, if you don't mind, I would ask that you speak with your ambassador here at the temple. She has something of great import for you that needs taking care of before we send you up to the queen. <He pats at the letter under his sleeve.> I'll keep this safe for you until your return.Speak with your Ambassador^72^Horde^Dragonblight^Tariolstrasz^Golluck Rockfist^A Strange Device^^^Speak with Golluck Rockfist at Wyrmrest Temple.^<The dragon in elf form takes your letter of introduction, perusing it for a moment and then stashing it away within his sleeve.> Everything seems to be in order.

You should return to Wyrmrest Temple and speak with the steward, Tariolstrasz, once more, <name>.The Steward of Wyrmrest Temple^75^Horde^Dragonblight^Vargastrasz^Tariolstrasz^A Strange Device^^^Speak with Tariolstrasz at Wyrmrest Temple.^You've proved that you're to be trusted and more. You should return to Wyrmrest Temple and speak with the steward, Tariolstrasz, once more, <name>.Reallocating Resources^75^Alliance^Grizzly Hills^Captain Gryan Stoutmantle^Sergeant Riannah^^^^Gryan Stoutmantle wants you to report to Sergeant Riannah at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak.^Listen up, <class>! Your days here are numbered. As much as we need capable <class>s in our ranks, there's trouble up north that makes our problems look like a mid-summer Stormwind parade. Turns out the Scourge are concentrating their efforts - making a big push to take over Zul'Drak. If that happens, we may as well pack it in. You're free to finish any business here, but then it's off to Light's Breach with you. Speak to Samuel if you need transportation. Dismissed.The Scarlet Apocalypse^55^All^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^The Lich King^The Scarlet Apocalypse^Scarlet Armies Approach...^^Seek out the Lich King at Death's Breach.^The trap has been sprung, death knight. The armies of Hearthglen and Tirisfal have arrived, just in time to see their enclave in flames! If they turn back now, they fight us with their backs turned. <Mograine shakes his head.> No, they have only one option, which has only one outcome: APOCALYPSE! As we speak, they prepare to make one final stand. The Lich King awaits your return, champion. He stands watch below us, at Death's Breach.An End To All Things...^55^All^Death Knight^The Lich King^The Lich King^The Scarlet Apocalypse^^^The Lich King has commanded you to eradicate the Scarlet Crusade.^You have slaughtered legions beyond number and still your dark heart craves more. Your hunger knows no end, <name>. <The Lich King pauses.> There must come an end to all things, death knight. The Scarlet armies make their final stand against us. For them, there is no escape... no choice. And for this reason they will fight with a ferocity that you have yet to witness. Use this horn to call forth one of my wyrms. Climb upon its back and command it into battle. With it you will end the Scarlet Crusade.Into the Breach!^75^All^Zul'Drak^Crusader Valus^Sergeant Riannah^^The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar^^Crusader Valus at Light's Trust wants you to report to Sergeant Riannah at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak.^Ready yourself, <class>. I'm dispatching you to Light's Breach, northeast of here. I've received word that the Scourge are making a push to take over Zul'Drak. <Valus stares you dead in the eyes.> This will not come to pass. See to it that you assist in the destruction of the Scourge there. The light demands it. Dismissed.Learning to Leave and Return: the Magical Way^74^All^Dalaran^Archmage Celindra^Archmage Celindra^The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^^^Archmage Celindra at The Violet Gate in Dalaran wants you to use the Teleport to Violet Stand Crystal and the Teleport to Dalaran Crystal.^Just in case you don't already know, you can use the crystal on the platform behind me to teleport to the Violet Stand in Crystalsong Forest beneath Dalaran. Correspondingly, you can use the crystal at the stand below to return to the chamber above me. I would like for you to do this now.The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^74^Horde^Dalaran^Image of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver^Archmage Celindra^The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^^^Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to Archmage Celindra at The Violet Gate in Dalaran.^Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend. No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest. We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there. When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke.First Things First^75^All^Zul'Drak^Commander Kunz^Sergeant Riannah^^^^Commander Kunz at Argent Stand wants you to report to Sergeant Riannah at Light's Breach.^Listen up, <race>! This entire region is full of crises. Everywhere you look you'll find those who could use your assistance. <Kunz looks you squarely in the eye.> No one needs your help right now more than Riannah. The scourge have forced their way between us, leaving her and those she commands isolated. Light's Breach, where her forces are holding out, lies just southwest of here.Smoke on the Horizon^75^All^Zul'Drak^Witch Doctor Khufu^Sergeant Riannah^^^^Khufu in Zim'Torga wants you to travel to Light's Breach and report to Sergeant Riannah there.^You hear that, <race>? The clamor of battle far to the west reaches us here, even over the din of our own struggle. The Scourge are threatening to break through the lines of those calling themselves the Argent Crusade. Preventing this is as urgent as anything in the region. Travel to Light's Breach and join in their struggle. Speak to Maaka and he will provide you safe passage.The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^74^Alliance^Dalaran^Baron Ulrik von Stromhearth^Archmage Celindra^The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^^^Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to Archmage Celindra at the Violet Gate in Dalaran.^Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend. No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest. We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there. When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke.Taking a Stand^75^All^Zul'Drak^Bloodrose Datura^Commander Falstaav^Taking a Stand^Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes^^Bloodrose Datura at Ebon Watch wants you to speak with Commander Falstaav at The Argent Stand.^A few moments ago I spotted a signal flare over the treeline to the east. That can only mean that things are not going smoothly for the Crusaders at Argent Stand. I cannot leave our post here, <race>, but you can. When time permits, make your way up to Commander Falstaav and see if there's anything you can do to lighten their burden.The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^74^All^Dalaran^Magister Teronus III^Archmage Celindra^The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran^^^Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to Archmage Celindra at The Violet Gate in Dalaran.^Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend. No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest. We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there. When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke.Back Through the Waygate^78^All^Sholazar Basin^The Etymidian^Avatar of Freya^The Lifewarden's Wrath^^^Bring the Omega Rune to the Avatar of Freya at the Rainspeaker Rapids in Sholazar Basin.^You speak the truth, <race>. I can sense the very essence of Sholazar Basin begin to fray by the blight of undeath even as we speak. I've bound my being into the rune, <race>. Deliver it to she who sent you here -- for only her power can grant me passage to her lands.Siphoning the Spirits^75^All^Zul'Drak^Captain Arnath^Captain Arnath^^^Stocking the Shelves, Clipping Their Wings^Captain Arnath at Heb'Valok wants you to collect 5 Ancient Ectoplasms from the Lost Drakkari Spirits at the Pools of Zha'Jin.^You should be happy he's coming, they said. You'll enjoy his company, they said.... Well it's not as if I had a choice in the matter. Finklestein is the Crusade's best alchemist. I suppose I should be honored that he's chosen my post to set up shop. But ever since he's arrived, I've been relegated to collecting various alchemical ingredients. Say, <race>, how about you give me a hand? Just south of here are some pools that are haunted by spirits of ancient trolls. Collect their ectoplasm for me.The Lich King's Command^55^All^Death Knight^The Lich King^Scourge Commander Thalanor^The Scarlet Apocalypse^^The Light of Dawn^Report to Scourge Commander Thalanor at Browman Mill.^The Scarlet Enclave is no more. What remains of the Crusade will be dealt with in Northrend. We now turn all of our efforts to Light's Hope Chapel. No longer will this affront to your master be allowed to exist! I have issued my final command. Scourge Commander Thalanor awaits your arrival at the edge of Browman Mill. Go northwest, through the cave, into the Noxious Glade and take the path leading out of the glade to the mill. Do not fail me, <name>.The Light of Dawn^55^All^Death Knight^Scourge Commander Thalanor^Highlord Darion Mograine^The Light of Dawn^The Lich King's Command^^Defeat the forces of the Argent Dawn and uncover the Light of Dawn.^The Argent Dawn stands defiantly against us at Light's Hope Chapel. They dare oppose the Scourge and for that reason alone they must be destroyed! The mighty armies of the Lich King stand at the ready as the final battle for the Plaguelands approaches. Today we ascend into the immortal realm of Scourge heroes! When you are ready for battle, report to Highlord Darion Mograine. It is the highlord who will issue the final march orders and command our armies at Light's Hope Chapel.My Heart is in Your Hands^74^All^Grizzly Hills^Heart of the Ancients^Image of Drakuru^Good Troll Hunting^^^Drakuru wants you to bring the Heart of the Ancients to him at Drak'atal Passage.^<Drakuru's voice fills your mind.> Hey, mon! Dis eye of da prophets be great! I been usin' it to watch ya and I see ya got da heart now! Not bad.... Now ya just gotta bring it to my brazier at Drak'atal Passage, a short walk east of ya. Ya must drink my elixir at da pedestal to summon me there. This time, ya need ta mix in some desperate mojo from the defenders there for it ta be workin'.Force of Nature^78^All^Sholazar Basin^Pilot Vic^Avatar of Freya^Force of Nature^^^Travel to the Blight Line, between Rainspeaker Rapids and the Lost Lands in Sholazar Basin and seek the Avatar of Freya.^I'm not sure about what I saw while flying to the northeast, but to me it looked like a gigantic woman kicking some Scourge butt. I'd heard the professor talk about a certain "lifewarden" appointed by the titans to look over Sholazar. I might not be a titan historian, but it sounds like she fits the bill. I also know that if the Scourge cross the border between the Lost Lands and the rest of Sholazar, our expedition's as good as dead. What do you say you go look for her and lend a hand?A Steak Fit for a Hunter^76^All^Sholazar Basin^Korg the Cleaver^Korg the Cleaver^^^^Bring 5 Longneck Grazer Steaks to Korg the Cleaver at the Nesingwary Base Camp.^Sometimes, there's nothing worse than a camp full of hunters. They're all so busy taking down prey animals that the only meat I get is tough and stringy. That's hardly the kind of thing you want to come home to after a long day on the hunt. Lucky for us, though, there is a source of tender, succulent meat nearby. To the south of the river and the camp live longneck grazers. They're a perfect source of meat for our hungry hunters. Bring me back the best cuts of meat and we'll properly toast our comrades.Salvaging Life's Strength^77^All^Sholazar Basin^Avatar of Freya^Avatar of Freya^^The Fallen Pillar^^The Avatar of Freya wants you to go to the Sundered Shard to the southeast and use the Lifeforce Gem on 8 destroyed Lifeblood Elementals.^The Lifeblood Pillar was toppled over with great force, sending the very earth into an upheaval. The elementals that wander the sundered shard carry with them the very life essence that gave the pillar its strength. I cannot allow this energy to be wasted, for only four pillars remain. Head to the sundered shard, to the southeast, and seek the lifeblood elementals. Use this gem on their remains to recover their rampant energy. We'll need the energy to heal the land when all this is over.To the Rise with all Due Haste!^80^All^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Lord-Commander Arete^To the Rise with all Due Haste!^^^Report to Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise in Icecrown.^Some would say that our most critical mission lies not with the Lich King, but with the utter destruction of the Scarlet Onslaught. I would say that is foolish, but who am I to judge? Death's Rise is far to the southwest, overlooking the sea along the cliff wall. There you will find Lord-Commander Arete personally overseeing the Onslaught's destruction himself. <The baron clears his throat.> Do see to it that you report to him with all due haste. He asked for you personally.The Story Thus Far...^80^All^Icecrown^Lord-Commander Arete^Lord-Commander Arete^To the Rise with all Due Haste!^^From Their Corpses, Rise!, Intelligence Gathering^Listen to Lord-Commander Arete's tale at Death's Rise.^We have much to do, but first I believe a short refresher is in order. We death knights have a colorful past with our Scarlet friends who idiotically rest comfortably in the harbor below us to the northwest. When you are ready for an earful, speak with me again and I shall provide enlightenment.Blood in the Water^80^All^Icecrown^Lord-Commander Arete^Lord-Commander Arete^To the Rise with all Due Haste!^^^Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise wants you to fill the Gore Bladder with the blood of 10 Ravenous Jaws.^The forces at Onslaught Harbor are heavily reinforced by gryphon riders. You need a mount that will enable you to put them down. But first, we need the components for the ritual that is going to make it all happen. A great deal of blood is necessary for the ritual to be undertaken. <The lord-commander points down and to the northwest.> There is a readily available supply down there in the harbor... sharks. Do not return to me until you've filled this bladder with their blood.From Their Corpses, Rise!^80^All^Icecrown^Setaal Darkmender^Setaal Darkmender^^The Story Thus Far...^^Setaal Darkmender at Death's Rise has given you the Darkmender's Tincture. Apply it to the corpses of 10 of any of the Scarlet Onslaught units found at Onslaught Harbor.^How kind... how generous our lord-commander is. Where he is flowers and sunshine, I am filled only with hatred. It is not enough to end their miserable lives... I want them humiliated... debased! What could be more unspeakable than to be turned into that which you hate? To dedicate your existence to eradicating a thing, and then in the end to become it? How sad. Take this tincture northwest to Onslaught Harbor. Apply it to their still corpses and watch what happens, but avoid the cathedral.You'll Need a Gryphon^80^All^Icecrown^Lord-Commander Arete^Uzo Deathcaller^To the Rise with all Due Haste!^^No Fly Zone^Deliver an Onslaught Gryphon to Uzo Deathcaller at Death's Rise.^What could be more fitting than to take one of their own gryphons to use against them? Go to Onslaught Harbor and take the reins to one of their gryphons from the dead clutches of its rider. Return with the gryphon, delivering it to Uzo Deathcaller. He will see to its proper transformation and provide you with further instructions.No Fly Zone^80^All^Icecrown^Uzo Deathcaller^Uzo Deathcaller^^You'll Need a Gryphon^^Uzo Deathcaller at Death's Rise wants you to kill 10 Onslaught Gryphon Riders.^Now that you got your bone gryphon, I wantcha to take it back down there everyday and make a no fly zone over Onslaught Harbor. I gotta admit, mon, I don't really care if you use the bone gryphon to kill them gryphon riders or not. But I'm guessin' that if you do, you'll find it much easier to get to 'em. Besides, it's got lots of neat tricks you can use.Investigate the Scourge of Silvermoon^10^Horde^Scourge Invasion^Lieutenant Julek^Lieutenant Julek^^^^Collect three Dim Necrotic Stones from the Scourge outside Silvermoon and investigate the glowing runic circles near their encampment.^The Lich King has sent his undead upon our very doorstep; we cannot remain idle! Surely you will step up to defend Silvermoon from these accursed invaders? There are strange runic circles outside, glowing with the same energy that surrounds the undead and the Necropolis above. They have significance, I'm certain, and I want you to find out what. Thin the numbers of those aberrations while you're at it; bring me proof of their death along with your results, and I will reward you. Go!Investigate the Scourge of Exodar^10^Alliance^Scourge Invasion^Lieutenant Kregor^Lieutenant Kregor^^^^Collect three Dim Necrotic Stones from the Scourge outside the Exodar and investigate the glowing runic circles near their encampment. Then return to Lieutenant Kregor.^The Lich King has sent his undead upon our very doorstep; we cannot remain idle! Surely you will step up to defend the Exodar from these accursed invaders? There are strange runic circles outside, glowing with the same energy that surrounds the undead and the Necropolis above. They have significance, I'm certain, and I want you to find out what. Thin the numbers of those aberrations while you're at it; bring me proof of their death along with your results, and I will reward you. Go!Clean Up^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Jeer Sparksocket^Jeer Sparksocket^Clean Up^^^Jeer Sparksocket at K3 would like 10 pieces of Charred Wreckage.^To the point... Ricket's asked me to put together some stronger land mines, but I'm running low on parts. Just west of town, you'll find the remains of our last rocket sled... Ricket got a little excited when she was fueling it, but I probably should have thought to not put the nozzle right over the exhaust. Live and learn, eh? There should be a good stock of spare parts scattered around the destroyed sled... why don't you go ahead and chase off those scavengers and nab me some of that wreckage?Just Around the Corner^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Jeer Sparksocket^Jeer Sparksocket^Clean Up^^^Jeer Sparksocket at K3 would like Sparksocket's Tools retrieved from his minefield.^Blast it! Where are my tools? I had them here just a moment ago. Oh! I probably forgot them when I was setting up that minefield in the west. That's mildly inconvenient. I'd be quite appreciative if you could go get them for me. You'll need to watch your step though... you should be able to use the same path that I did to get out. Oh, and don't try to fly in... I had the presence of mind to set up turrets to shoot down anything that might fly, and they aren't very discerning in who they target.A Delicate Touch^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^Clean Up^^^Ricket at K3 wants you to use Improved Land Mines at Garm's Bane to fend off 12 attackers from Garm. Both Garm Invaders and Snowblind Followers will count towards this goal.^I've been waiting an eternity for these mines! Well, a few days at least. What took him so long? Here's the low down, compadre... there's this nasty bunch of magnataur--you know, big, hairy, and extremely ugly--and they seem pretty keen on taking K3 for themselves. Not going to happen. We've got some defenses set up in their path, northeast of here. Sadly, our laser turrets have pretty limited power supplies... that's where these mines come in! Get over there and blow them up good!Opening the Backdoor^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^Opening the Backdoor^Ample Inspiration^^Ricket at K3 would like you to locate the Transporter Power Cell and use it to activate the Transportation Pad at Garm's Rise.^The sapper squad is ready. That means it's fun time, my dear! There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind Garm--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there. I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter.Know No Fear^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^Opening the Backdoor^^^Ricket at K3 wants you to kill 6 Garm Watchers and 8 Snowblind Devotees.^Now that we have the teleporter open, my plan is quite complex... it has several facets and will take impeccable coordination. And there are supplies to be gathered! And troops to recruit! Likely, weeks of hard labor as well! Hahah, I had you going there for a moment, didn't I? You've got this, kid. Hop through the teleporter and take the fight to them! Our sappers will back you up... they won't have anywhere to run.A Flawless Plan^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Gino^Gino^A Flawless Plan^^^Gino at Garm's Rise wants you to plant the Hardpacked Explosive Bundle near Frostgut's Altar, kill Tormar Frostgut, and then escape the cave before it collapses on you.^Hey there! Joining us for the assault I assume? I've got a special task for you... we're going to bring the whole cave down on their heads! Towards the back of their cave, you should find Frostgut's Altar. Sneak up and plant this hardpacked explosive bundle somewhere close to it. Once the charge is placed, stick around just long enough to make sure Frostgut bites it, then get out quickly! There's no knowing how long the cave will last once that thing goes off!Demolitionist Extraordinaire^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Gino^Ricket^A Flawless Plan^^Overstock, When All Else Fails, When All Else Fails^Return to Ricket at K3.^You've got some swift feet on you sonny! Thanks for lending a hand with those explosives... I've been waiting to give that invention a good test run for a while! Go ahead and tell Ricket we should be covered on the magnataur front now... my sappers will clean up any of the remaining baddies. Thanks again!Slightly Unstable^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Jeer Sparksocket^Ricket^Clean Up^^^Deliver Jeer's Improved Land Mines to Ricket in K3.^Looking good! No, not you - my new mines. You're just a little full of yourself, aren't you? I, on the other hand, am absolutely brilliant! My intellect cannot be matched. What were we talking about? Oh yes, my new mines! New and improved... ready for whatever devious use Ricket has concocted. Be a <good lad/doll> and go hand them off to Ricket, will you? She's right over there... it should be quite the epic journey, I'm sure. Be careful though, she's a little loopy.Reclaimed Rations^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^^^^Ricket at K3 wants you to repossess 16 Dried Gnoll Rations from the nearby Savage Hill Gnolls.^Hey hey! You're a new face! Care to lend Ricket a hand? We have a somewhat unexpected problem - food shortage. I know, I know... we should have seen that coming, but you don't get it. We tend to have somewhat of a quick turn-around here with our sapper squad and all, so usually we don't have to worry about long term eats. Good old K3's gotten popular though. Convenient solution? There are gnoll camps to the west and some gnolls scattered, scavenging as gnolls do. Care to go nab some of their rations?Ample Inspiration^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^^Expression of Gratitude^Opening the Backdoor^Ricket at K3 wants you to retrieve a U.D.E.D, use it to blow up a mammoth, and retrieve 8 Hearty Mammoth Meat.^Wow! That stuff is nasty. Not to account for gnoll taste or anything, but I figured whatever they had would at least be... edible? Let's get more creative. Tore's got an explosive dispenser north of town... not far from the big cavern entrance, can't miss it. I'm sure she intends them for mining purposes of some sort, but I've got a better idea. Grab one of those things and rush it to one of the nearby mammoths... most of them are to the west. Collect the meat, bring it back.Moving In^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Tore Rumblewrench^Tore Rumblewrench^^^^Tore Rumblewrench outside of Crystalweb Cavern wants you to kill 12 Crystalweb Spiders.^Hiya! The name's Tore. I head up the mining operation here at K3... or I will shortly anyway! This here cave is full of creepy-crawlies. I think we could do with a few less spiders before we move in - what'd you think?Ore Repossession^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Tore Rumblewrench^Tore Rumblewrench^^^^Tore Rumblewrench outside of Crystalweb Cavern would like you to retrieve 5 samples of Impure Saronite Ore.^We're moving in! There were some snobolds here when we arrived... their mining operation seems to have met some unfortunate happenings though. Doesn't much matter - we were taking over soon anyway. I sent some of our miners in there to get me some ore samples that I can use to calibrate our machines for processing, but they haven't come back. Mind going in there and nabbing some samples for me in their stead? The snobolds probably have some on them, though I'd expect most of them are dead by now.Only Partly Forgotten^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Injured Goblin Miner^Injured Goblin Miner^Only Partly Forgotten^^^An Injured Goblin Miner in Crystalweb Cavern wants you to bring back an Icetip Venom Sac from an Icetip Crawler.^Oi... it's like there's a propeller in my stomach. I think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders... and brightly colored. Ricket can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think Tore's coming. I'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone.Bitter Departure^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Injured Goblin Miner^Ricket^Only Partly Forgotten^^^Escort the Injured Goblin Miner out of Crystalweb Cavern and then speak to Ricket at K3.^Oi - thank you! I thought for sure I'd just be a spider snack. Perhaps I'm speaking a bit soon though - let's get the heck out of here! Let me know as soon as you're ready to go... make it quick.Overstock^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^^Demolitionist Extraordinaire^^Ricket at K3 wants you to use Improved Land Mines at Garm's Bane to fend off the attackers from Garm. Both Garm Invaders and Snowblind Followers will count towards this goal.^Hey there again! You didn't run off like all the other adventurers did? Well, you're just a peach, aren't ya? I was beginning to think I smelled funny or something! We could still use a bit of a hand around here, and you have just the right experience. Remember those magnataur? Well apparently the cave didn't completely collapse... there are still quite a few left. So much for Gino taking care of them, eh? Fortunately, Jeer made way more than enough mines. You've got this!Expression of Gratitude^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Ricket^^^Ample Inspiration^Ricket at K3 wants you to kill Gnarlhide.^I know just the job for an eager newcomer! We've got a gnoll problem. You might even call it a gnoll infestation! Pesky things. They keep creeping up more and more, and now they're on our doorstep, stealing our parts! Inconceivable. It all begins and ends with their uppity leader, Gnarlhide. I want you to see to that "ends" part. Go pay him a visit at his camp all the way to the west, in Snowblind Hills. And when I say "pay him a visit," that's a euphemism for "kill him painfully." Kay? Kay!Intelligence Gathering^80^All^Icecrown^Aurochs Grimbane^Aurochs Grimbane^^The Story Thus Far...^^Aurochs Grimbane at Death's Rise wants you to collect 5 Onslaught Intel Documents.^I need to know what the Scarlet Onslaught is planning today. You will be my instrument in this task. Fly to Onslaught Harbor and rifle through their baggage trunks for documents. The trunks will be locked, so you'll have to take the keys from the Scarlet Onslaught members by whatever means.The Grand (Admiral's) Plan^80^All^Icecrown^Note from the Grand Admiral^Lord-Commander Arete^The Grand (Admiral's) Plan^^^Deliver the Note from the Grand Admiral to Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise.^At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion. The letter conveys that Grand Admiral Westwind is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the Scarlet Onslaught will wash over first the Lich King and then the rest of world to finally bring order to Azeroth. The lord-commander will want to see this!In Strict Confidence^80^All^Icecrown^Lord-Commander Arete^Lord-Commander Arete^The Grand (Admiral's) Plan^^^Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise wants you to beat information out of Captains Welsington and Hartford.^If anyone knows where the admiral is, then surely it must be his captains on the ships in Onslaught Harbor. <The lord-commander rubs his hands together.> Welsington and Hartford are their names if memory serves. Go beat the information out of them and then end their miserable lives. I want to know where the grand admiral is hidden!The Crone's Bargain^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Lok'lira the Crone inside the Forlorn Mine wants you to retrieve the Runes of the Yrkvinn from Overseer Syra.^Yes, it must be the green-skinned prisoner you're after... We might be able to help each other. You're not going to get the goblin out of here by force. Not alive, anyway. Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions. As you can see, the Hyldnir have made me their prisoner. If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them. Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra. She has my runes. Retrieve them and we'll talk some more.Runeforging: Preparation For Battle^55^All^Death Knight^Instructor Razuvious^Instructor Razuvious^In Service Of The Lich King^^^Instructor Razuvious in Ebon Hold has commanded you to use your Runeforging ability to engrave a rune [of your choosing] upon your Runed Soulblade.^The mark of war is etched indelibly upon your soul, death knight. You have learned the dark art of runeforging and with it you will engrave runes of power upon your weaponry. Preparations for battle must be made. Return to one of the runeforges, here in the Heart of Acherus, and use the power of runeforging to emblazon your weapon with a rune of power! Return to me when your blade glows with dark energy!They Took Our Men!^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretchen Fizzlespark^Gretchen Fizzlespark^They Took Our Men!^^^Gretchen Fizzlespark wants you to go to Sifreldar Village and rescue 5 Goblin Prisoners.^You have to help us! We were in the middle of an expedition into the mountains to set up a transmission tower when we were attacked. They looked like vrykul, except their skin was blue and layered with frost.... and they were all female! They took all the men in the expedition and let us women go. Please, <name>! We think they're being held in Sifreldar, the village overlooking K3.Equipment Recovery^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretchen Fizzlespark^Gretchen Fizzlespark^^^^Gretchen Fizzlespark wants you to obtain 8 pieces of K3 Equipment in Sifreldar Village north of K3.^Please, <name>. When the Hyldnir took our men, they also took all our equipment. Of course, it's more important that we get our boys back, but if you run into any of our equipment, I'd really appreciate it if you brought it back to us. You'll find their village just above us, to the north.Leave No Goblin Behind^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretchen Fizzlespark^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Find the entrance to the Forlorn Mine in northern Sifreldar Village and look for clues for Zeev Fizzlespark's whereabouts.^All of our boys are back... thanks to you, <name>! Well... all but one. My brother Zeev is still up there according to the others. Apparently they have some sort of mine where they make their prisoners work. Go in there and see if you can find out anything.Second Chances^80^All^Icecrown^Lord-Commander Arete^Lord-Commander Arete^The Grand (Admiral's) Plan^^^Kill Archbishop Landgren and then summon Arete's Gate in the presence of his corpse. Speak with Lord-Commander Arete inside The Crimson Cathedral once he's completed his questioning of the archbishop's spirit.^I'd heard they have an archbishop in their cathedral, but I had no idea that they'd resurrected and promoted Landgren! The Crimson Cathedral is heavily guarded with only one entrance, so you'll need help. We still need to know where the grand admiral is, but this time we're not taking any chances! Take this device. It can be used to summon a gate for me to step through once you've killed the archbishop. I'll have my answers directly from his compelled soul! We will find Grand Admiral Westwind!The Endless Hunger^55^All^Death Knight^Instructor Razuvious^Instructor Razuvious^In Service Of The Lich King^^^Instructor Razuvious in Ebon Hold has commanded you to free an Unworthy Initiate and then kill the Unworthy Initiate in cold blood!^The endless hunger will soon take hold of you, <class>. When it does, you will feel pain immeasurable. There is only one remedy for the suffering: the hunger must be sated. I give you the key to your salvation. Chained to the Heart of Acherus are those deemed unworthy of the dark brotherhood. Use the key to free an unworthy initiate. Allow them to equip their gear and battle you for their freedom. Kill and the pain will cease. Fail and suffer for eternity. Live or die - the choice is yours to make.Report To Scourge Commander Thalanor^55^All^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^Scourge Commander Thalanor^In Service Of The Lich King^^^Report to Scourge Commander Thalanor at the balcony on the first floor of Ebon Hold.^Scourge Commander Thalanor awaits your arrival at the overhang located directly southeast of our current position. Report to Thalanor and requisition a Scourge gryphon to deliver you to Death's Breach. Prince Valanar will be waiting for you down below. Suffer well, <brother/sister>!Going Bearback^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Brijana^Brijana^They Took Our Men!^^^Brijana at Brunnhildar Village wants you to mount Icefang and shoot 7 Frostworgs and 15 Frost Giants in the Valley of Ancient Winters.^The test awaits, woman! Do you have the heart of a warrior queen? Or that of a sniveling seamstress? One taste of war and you'll know the answer. You might lie to your mother, your sisters, and even yourself, but the battlefield always exposes one's true nature. When you've made your preparations, mount Icefang and ride into battle. From her back, you must rain down a shower of death upon our enemy.The Admiral Revealed^80^All^Icecrown^Lord-Commander Arete^Lord-Commander Arete^The Grand (Admiral's) Plan^^^Lord-Commander Arete wants you to deal with Grand Admiral Westwind. Return to the lord-commander upon Death's Rise after you have done so.^When High General Abbendis was confronted at New Hearthglen, the grand admiral protected himself within an impenetrable sphere of magic before making his escape. I am particularly adept at nullifying magic. Take this to use against him inside The Hidden Hollow when he puts the sphere up. I wish that I could be there to see the look on his face when you do it. Deal with him.Luxurious Getaway!^78^All^The Storm Peaks^Rin Duoctane^Jeer Sparksocket^^^^Speak to Jeer Sparksocket at K3 in the Storm Peaks.^Hey there, pal! Do you like excitement and explosions?! Who doesn't? I know just the place for you. Down at luxurious K3, they're always making innovative inventions and finding all-new ways to make things blow up! Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? If you want to be part of the fun, head on down today and speak to Jeer Sparksocket! Mandatory disclaimer: manual labor may be required to partake in previously indicated "excitement."On Brann's Trail^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Archaeologist Andorin^Archaeologist Andorin^^^^Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from Brann's camp and return it to Archaeologist Andorin at Frosthold.^After the discovery of Brann's journal in Grizzly Hills, we've only had one other communication from Brann. A mysterious note found its way to Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, with no indication of where it came from. All it said was that we're to meet Brann at his camp and help him with his search. From what I can tell, the camp should be located northeast of here, across the Bor's Breath River and at the foot of some ruins from the Path of the Titans.Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Archaeologist Andorin^Brann Bronzebeard^Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^^^Use the Frosthound Collar at the Abandoned Camp to track down whoever took Brann's possessions. When you recover them, use the communication device and speak to whoever you can contact.^The tone of Brann's note suggests he meant to bury something with the note, maybe a pack of some kind. You're sure this was all you found? Okay, I'm going to have you take one of these frosthounds with you. The frostborn use them for tracking. Bring it to the destroyed camp and let it get Brann's scent. It should at least lead you to the location of those missing possessions, and if we're lucky, Brann himself.Cold Hearted^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Brijana^Brijana^They Took Our Men!^^^Brijana, just east of Brunnhildar Village, wants you to fly to Dun Niffelem, then free 3 Captured Proto-Drakes and rescue 9 Brunnhildar Prisoners.^To be slain honorably on the field of battle brings us all glory. To be frozen in a block of ice and endlessly taunted does not.... You are to fly to the frost giant city of Dun Niffelem, just east of the Valley of Ancient Winters, and liberate a captive proto-drake. With her, you will be able to free our sisters from their frozen bonds and carry three of them safely home. Beware the giants' clubs, sister, lest you find yourself numbered among the captives.Wanted: Ragemane's Flipper^75^All^Zul'Drak^Wanted!^Chief Rageclaw^^^^Recover Ragemane's Flipper and return it to Chief Rageclaw at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak.^Posted by Chief Rageclaw: Chief Rageclaw trusty lion seal, Ragemane, bite hand that feed him. Rageclaw say Ragemane no more good because of bad Drakuru trolls. Chief Rageclaw very sad to ask that Ragemane be killeded and Ragemane flipper be returned to chief as proof. You find Ragemane to southeast, at Rageclaw Lake. Chief Rageclaw sorry for bad writing. First time use one of these things; plus, Chief Rageclaw is wolvar, not person.Pieces to the Puzzle^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Brann Bronzebeard^Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^^^Gather 6 Inventor's Disk Fragments and use them to assemble the Inventor's Disk.^Thank the Light that someone got my message. Now that I'm safe from the iron dwarves, I need to ask your help with something. I've got a lead on Norgannon's keystone, which guards access to Ulduar's archives, but the Titans divided it into two pieces and secreted them away. One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within the Inventor's Library on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the library's guardians.This Just In: Fire Still Hot!^75^All^Zul'Drak^Elder Shaman Moky^Elder Shaman Moky^^^^Elder Shaman Moky at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak wants you to use the Rageclaw Fire Extinguisher to douse 15 hut fires at Rageclaw Den.^Trolls attack Rageclaw Den and kick Rageclaw out! It get worse. Trolls now burning village! This very bad. Chief make top Rageclaw shaman, Moky, do study on fire. Results very surprising! Fire still hot and can burn things. Will you help Rageclaw and put fire out? Moky has special Rageclaw fire extinguisher for you. Use special fire extinguisher to put out fire at Rageclaw Den to southeast. Sometimes take many sprays to douse fire, but extinguisher always have water! Rageclaw magic strong!Data Mining^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Brann Bronzebeard^Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^^^Use the Inventor's Disk to retrieve 7 pieces of Hidden Data from the Databanks.^That disk you assembled... it's blank! That crafty Mimir must've hidden the information somewhere else. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there? That might be what you need to do with the disk. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key.Trolls Is Gone Crazy!^75^All^Zul'Drak^Chief Rageclaw^Chief Rageclaw^^^^Chief Rageclaw at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak wants you to use the Drakuru "Lock Openers" found on various Drakuru trolls to free 8 Captured Rageclaw.^Drakuru... You know who this troll is? I think bad troll are controlled by the Drakuru troll. They call themself Drakuru trolls - that how I know. Now you see why I am chief of Rageclaw. Smartest of all wolvar! But that not why I talk to you now. Bad troll come and kick Rageclaw out of den. Rageclaw that no run away held as prisoner in village. You go to Rageclaw Den, southeast, and free captured Rageclaw. Kill troll for lock opener. You maybe kill many troll for many lock opener.When All Else Fails^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Rork Sharpchin^^Demolitionist Extraordinaire^^Speak to Ricket to make use of Ricket's D16 Propelled Delivery Device to enter further into Storm Peaks.^So... so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains. Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty vrykul women, territorial dragon want-to-bes and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening. Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it. <Ricket nods at some nearby rockets.>Offering Thanks^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Lagnus^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Offering Thanks^^^Bring the crate of medical supplies to Glorthal Stiffbeard in Frosthold.^Ah! Thanks for coming up here, <lad/lass>. Judging by your wide eyes and shivering hands, I'd venture a guess that you're somewhat new. Sounds like it would be good for you to meet our gracious hosts then! We've got some extra medical supplies... to be honest, we weren't expecting to have such a comfortable setup. Go ahead and give this crate to Glorthal over there, and lend them a hand if you would too. We don't want them to think we're ungrateful for how welcoming they've been.Missing Scouts^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Offering Thanks^^^Glorthal in Frosthold has requested a search of the Bor's Breath valley and Bor's Fall for any sign of the missing Frostborn Scouts.^There is something that I could use a hand with now that I have you. We have a few scouts that are extremely late in returning. The peaks are harsh... but these boys know what they're doing. Head to the east... along the Bor's Breath valley and near Bor's Fall... they should be out that direction. If you find any sign of one of them, bring me back news immediately. We have a few enemies in the area - if any of them are getting a bit uppity, the more warning the better.Loyal Companions^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Fjorlin Frostbrow^Fjorlin Frostbrow^Loyal Companions^^^Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to obtain 8 slabs of Fresh Ice Rhino Meat and use them to feed the Stormcrest Eagles above town.^Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time. Off to the east are the Foot Steppes... pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the proto-drakes that nest around there. If you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there.Stemming the Aggressors^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Offering Thanks^^^Glorthal Stiffbeard at Frosthold wants you to kill 8 Frostfeather Screechers and 8 Frostfeather Witches.^Damn harpies. We've beat that bunch into submission more times than I can remember... and they stay quiet for a time after each bout. This time, I'd thought that maybe it sunk in. Apparently not. Their memory may be a bit short, but if their numbers are thinned enough, they'll keep to themselves. Head into the valleys in the north and east and clear out a fair chunk of them for me, will ya?Baby Stealers^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Fjorlin Frostbrow^Fjorlin Frostbrow^Loyal Companions^^^Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold would like you to bring back 15 Stormcrest Eagle Eggs.^A few weeks ago, if you looked up, you'd see dozens of those beautiful eagles soaring the skies. Now, only a few if any. They've taken to staying with their nests nearly all the time now because the harpies have been stealing their eggs. The harpies have grown a taste for eagle flesh, it seems... the sick wretches are caring for the eggs long enough to feast on the hatchlings. Go into the valleys to the north or the east and find the eggs... bring them back here, and I'll take them back to the nests.Sirana Iceshriek^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Glorthal Stiffbeard^Offering Thanks^^^Glorthal Stiffbeard at Frosthold wants you to kill Sirana Iceshriek.^This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the harpies to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards. One of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here. Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done.Pushed Too Far^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Fjorlin Frostbrow^Fjorlin Frostbrow^^^^Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to ride with a Stormcrest Eagle and kill 16 Stormpeak Wyrms in the Foot Steppes.^You were there with Loken, weren't you? The iron dwarves captured Veranus, the brood mother of the proto-drakes. The drakes don't seem even a little bit happy about the situation... they've gotten very aggressive. They've pushed into stormcrest territory and the eagles have taken to an all out fight with them. It's time to return the favor. We're riding to the Foot Steppes and slaughtering them there. King Stormheart left this hammer to me - make good use and see to it that I get it back.Ancient Relics^78^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Rork Sharpchin^Rork Sharpchin^^^^Return 10 Relics of Ulduar to Rork Sharpchin in Frosthold.^Why hello thar! Before you be headin' off to do your grand questin' and adventure, might I beg a wee favor of ya, <lad/lass>? These mountains be packed full'a precious relics and baubles... this place be a dream come true for tha league. I'd be much obliged if ya could bring any such treasures you stumble upon back ta me. You can even share in me ale for tha trouble! Trust me <lad/lass>, that's a rich deal!Aid from the Explorers' League^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Lagnus^Aid from the Explorers' League^Norgannon's Shell^^Take Norgannon's Shell to Lagnus at Frosthold.^Interesting. I don't see any locking mechanisms on the shell. That suggests to me that it may take more than just finding the other piece to combine the keystone. Take the shell back to the expedition leader, Lagnus, at Frosthold. Once he gets over his awe, he should be able to glean what the core looks like based on the shell, and maybe they can get the Frost Dwarves to help find it. I'm going to see if I can find out how to combine the two pieces. We'll catch up once we've both made some progress.Norgannon's Shell^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Inventor's Library Console^Brann Bronzebeard^Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^^Aid from the Explorers' League, The Exiles of Ulduar^Recover Norgannon's Shell from Archivist Mechaton.^Charging inventor's disk. Disk charging completed. Preparing emergency protocol gamma. Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified. Please have a pleasant millennium.The Frostborn King^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Lagnus^Yorg Stormheart^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Speak to Yorg Stormheart in Frosthold.^Definitely... I can see exactly what the core must look like. If any of the frostborn have seen it, they'll be sure to recognize the description. There's no time to waste, let's get straight to business. Go talk to King Stormheart and request his aid... he's sure to know someone who can help us find the core. And be nice about it will you - he's very respected around here.Fervor of the Frostborn^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Yorg Stormheart^Yorg Stormheart^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Yorg Stormheart at Frosthold has requested that you speak to Fjorlin Frostbrow to secure a ride and face your challenge.^I be more than willing ta lend my shelter and home ta travelers in need, but I'm nae too keen ta force my people inte yer affairs. I'll tell ye what... my people are warriors, straight and true. On the day a frostborn becomes a man, he has ta prove himself in battle. He has ta show us that he'll not let size hold'm back. Show me yer as strong and fierce as one of my men, and I'll have them lend ye an ear or a blade. Speak ta Fjorlin over by the cliff to the south there and he'll put ye ta the test.An Experienced Guide^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Yorg Stormheart^Drom Frostgrip^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Locate Drom Frostgrip.^I don't know where this core is hiding, but ye knew that. I said I'd help though, and that I shall. There's a hermit by the name of Drom Frostgrip who lives in a cave north of here... down in tha valley. We've strayed away from the titans a bit ourselves being that there are so few about, but Drom's loyal to the old ways... he keeps an eye on their most precious places and speaks te the keeper Creteus often. Yer sure to find him in the back of his cave... tell'm I sent ye and he'll help ye.Unwelcome Guests^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Fjorlin Frostbrow^Fjorlin Frostbrow^^^^Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to kill 10 Stormforged Invaders.^Our scouts have spotted iron dwarves in the valley north of here. I overheard King Stormheart sending you to visit Drom and I'm admittedly a bit worried about'm. If you find any iron dwarves when you head down there, put'm down hard and fast for me, eh? I dun think they know exactly where we are or how to get here just yet, and I'd prefer to keep it that way.The Lonesome Watcher^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Drom Frostgrip^Creteus^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Recover Frostgrip's Signet Ring from an Iron Dwarf Monitor and then bring it to Creteus in the Foot Steppes.^I never found the core... but I've often spoken to the keeper Creteus, and his omissions give him away. You'll find Creteus over the mountains to the east, in the Foot Steppes, keeping watch on the Engine of the Makers. The core might well be in there, but you'll need to win Creteus's favor. The iron dwarves were here looking for something... it might well be the core. They took my ring. Find their leader, get the ring back, and show it to Creteus so that he knows I sent you.The Hidden Relic^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Creteus^The Guardian's Charge^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Creteus in the Foot Steppes has provided you with the information to locate Norgannon's Core.^During your absence, I was privileged enough to parley with the dwarf Brann Bronzebeard. This dwarf indicated his purpose for seeking the keystone, and I am satisfied that it is for satisfactory intent... I believe this dwarf may be the entity for which the keystone was created. Norgannon's Core is located in the Frigid Tomb to the southeast. Its guardians are ancient beings of ice, and they will not welcome your presence. Best these guardians and retrieve the keystone with my blessing, <race>.Fury of the Frostborn King^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^The Guardian's Charge^Creteus^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Bring Norgannon's Core back to Creteus in the Foot Steppes.^<As you retrieve the core from the chest, you hear the thumping of heavy footsteps rushing towards you from the corridor. There is the faint sound of battle in the distance.>The Master Explorer^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Creteus^Brann Bronzebeard^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Bring Norgannon's Core to Brann Bronzebeard in the Engine of the Makers.^Combining the keystone will require Norgannon's Binding - a device located in the Engine of the Makers, the large pit beside us. Brann should be down there with the other half of the keystone now. I have instructed him on the use of the device. He awaits your presence. I will do what I can to keep the iron dwarves occupied, but I do not have confidence that I will hold them for long. King Stormheart is returning to the defense of Frosthold with some of his men shortly. Please hurry, <race>.Ancient Relics^78^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Olut Alegut^Olut Alegut^^^^Return 10 Relics of Ulduar to Olut Alegut at the Grom'arsh Crash-site.^Welcome to the peaks. I have a simple request before you head off on whatever grand jaunt you have planned. There are relics and treasures of ancient Ulduar scattered through these mountains. Most are likely in possession of the various sentient races. Return any that you find to me, and I will reward you in kind. Perhaps I'll even let you partake on my many potent ales.Orders From Drakuru^75^All^Zul'Drak^Orders From Drakuru^Crusader Lord Lantinga^In Search Of Answers^^Crusader Forward Camp^Return the Orders From Drakuru to Crusader Lord Lantinga at Light's Breach in Zul'Drak.^Minions be hearin' da call of your masta! Da Lich King be givin' Drakuru full control of da armies of da Scourge in Zul'Drak. We be commanded ta kill everyting. EVERYTING MUST DIE!

Zul'Drak and Gundrak gonna fall to da Scourge!The Ebon Watch^75^All^Zul'Drak^Crusader Lord Lantinga^Stefan Vadu^In Search Of Answers^^^Deliver the Orders From Drakuru to Stefan Vadu at Ebon Watch in Zul'Drak.^West of here, across the ruined roads and structures, is the death knight encampment of Ebon Watch. <Crusader Lord Lantinga rolls up Drakuru's orders.> Take these orders and deliver them to Stefan Vadu. He is the death knight in command at Ebon Watch. Let him know that the Argent Crusade will deal with Prince Navarius. They'll have to handle Drakuru. Be careful, <name>. The way to Ebon Watch is teeming with Scourge.The Exiles of Ulduar^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^^Norgannon's Shell^^Speak with Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^The Storm Peaks are an intriguing place, but there's far more here than titan ruins. The peoples who live here face a dire threat in Loken and his minions. He sent his favorite servants, the iron dwarves, on a brutal campaign against all the creatures of stone. He expelled the earthen from Ulduar, forcing them to take shelter at Bouldercrag's Refuge, on the face of a mountain west of the Inventor's Library. Bouldercrag and his brethren are beset by the iron dwarves there. Find and help them, <name>.The Drakkensryd^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretta the Arbiter^Thorim^The Last of Her Kind^^Maintaining Discipline, Defending Your Title^Use the Hyldnir Harpoon to defeat 10 Hyldsmeet Drakeriders at the Temple of Storms. Use the Hyldnir Harpoon on a Column Ornament to exit the Drakkensryd and speak to Thorim when you've succeeded.^This is it. You've passed all the tests of the Hyldsmeet... all but one. You've risen among our sisters' best and fiercest. The final test is at hand. The Drakkensryd - the true test of a Hyldnir's worth and warrior spirit. It'll be you, your riding drake, a chained harpoon and a score of your sisters vying for dominance. Show no quarter. None will be expected.It's All Fun and Games^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Baron Sliver^It's All Fun and Games^^I Have an Idea, But First...^Destroy The Ocular and then report to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.^The Knights of the Ebon Blade want to take the Scourge base known as The Shadow Vault to the northwest. I have a contact in their group who has asked for help. The first step is to blind the Lich King. He's using a device known as The Ocular to watch the area, which floats above the vault's spires. Our dwarves have created something for you to use against it. After the 'eye' has been destroyed, find Baron Sliver on the vault grounds. He's pretending to still be under the Lich King's will.SCRAP-E^80^All^The Storm Peaks^SCRAP-E Access Card^SCRAP-E^^^The Prototype Console^Bring the SCRAP-E Access Card along with 4 Handfuls of Cobalt Bolts and 5 Overcharged Capacitors to SCRAP-E at The Inventor's Library.^This card allows the user to access the control panel of the scrapbot designated SCRAP-E, in order to perform maintenance and reprogram the bot's directives. SCRAP-E appears to be assigned to the interior of the building at The Inventor's Library. The card displays a list of the bot's broken components and failing systems. With the proper parts, the bot can be restored to working condition.The Prototype Console^80^All^The Storm Peaks^SCRAP-E^Prototype Console^^SCRAP-E^^Relevant Locations^Designation SCRAP-E. Directive: Maintain consoles and databases of Inventor's Library in Keeper Mimir's absences. Time since last maintenance cycle: 489 days. Status of schematic data: unknown. Current tasks: Repair prototype console.I Have an Idea, But First...^80^All^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Baron Sliver^It's All Fun and Games^^^Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault has asked you to collect a Cultist Rod, an Abomination Hook, a Geist Rope, and 5 Scourge Essences.^When I was in the - ahem - employ of the Lich King, we would often use a device known as a sovereign rod to keep some of the more intelligent Scourge in line. I require that you assist me in the construction of a new one. Luckily for you, all of the necessary components are at hand: a cultist rod, an abomination hook, a geist rope, and a handful of Scourge essences. This should not be difficult, <class>.It's All Fun and Games^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Baron Sliver^It's All Fun and Games^^I Have an Idea, But First...^Destroy The Ocular and then report to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.^The Knights of the Ebon Blade want to take the Scourge base known as The Shadow Vault to the northwest. I have a contact in their group who has asked for help. The first step is to blind the Lich King. He's using a device known as The Ocular to watch the area, which floats above the vault's spires. Our goblins have created something for you to use against it. After the 'eye' has been destroyed, find Baron Sliver on the vault grounds. He's pretending to still be under the Lich King's will.Free Your Mind^80^All^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Baron Sliver^It's All Fun and Games^^If He Cannot Be Turned, If He Cannot Be Turned^Baron Sliver at the Shadow Vault wants you to use the Sovereign Rod on the corpses of Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper.^Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper would make excellent weapons in the fight against the Lich King if they can be broken from his will. That is what the Sovereign Rod is for. You'll find them on the ledges to the east and west of the vault, as well as on the mid-tier of the vault above us. The rod is to be used upon the corpses of the three. Fly now. We will have them as our own!Crusader Forward Camp^75^All^Zul'Drak^Crusader Lord Lantinga^Crusader MacKellar^Crusader Forward Camp^Orders From Drakuru^Making Something Out Of Nothing, A Great Storm Approaches^Seek out Crusader MacKellar at the Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak.^Crusader Dargath, Crusader MacKellar, Engineer Reed and the twins, Gerk and Burr, were sent to the Dead Fields to establish a battle front days ago. As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here. In light of this newfound information about Drakuru and Prince Navarius I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste. Pack up your belongings, <name>. You must leave at once!The Missing Bronzebeard^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Boktar Bloodfury^Boktar Bloodfury^The Missing Bronzebeard^^^Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from Brann's camp and return it to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.^Before we left, I received the file Scout Vor'takh compiled on this Brann Bronzebeard. There can be no doubt that Brann was headed for the Storm Peaks from his journal entries and findings in Grizzly Hills. Before we crashed, I caught sight of a campsite south of here, across the Foot Steppes, and overlooking the frozen Bor's Breath River. If Brann isn't there, search the camp and its environs for any clues as to where that blasted dwarf might've gone. Bring back anything you find.If He Cannot Be Turned^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Thassarian^If He Cannot Be Turned^Free Your Mind^^Defeat General Lightsbane and then report your success back to Thassarian aboard the gunship, The Skybreaker.^Death knights, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the Lich King's will except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern forge and I assure you, he will come. I'll send Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper in to help you. If we are to finally own The Shadow Vault, General Lightsbane must fall!If He Cannot Be Turned^80^Horde^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Koltira Deathweaver^If He Cannot Be Turned^Free Your Mind^^Defeat General Lightsbane and then report your success back to Koltira Deathweaver aboard the gunship, Orgrim's Hammer.^Death knights, such as General Lightsbane, are held on too tight of a leash to be able to be turned from the Lich King's will except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The general keeps himself within the vault overseeing the creation of new weapons. Disturb one of his weapon racks at the northern forge and I assure you, he will come. I'll send Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper in to help you. If we are to finally own The Shadow Vault, General Lightsbane must fall!The Shadow Vault^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Baron Sliver^If He Cannot Be Turned^^The Duke^Report back to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.^It sounds like you did extremely well. And you secured three very important allies for the Knights of the Ebon Blade in the process. <Thassarian gazes out over the horizon.> You should head back. By now, Baron Sliver and the other death knights will be fighting tooth and nail to hold The Shadow Vault against the might of the Scourge. I'm sure they'll need your help.The Shadow Vault^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Baron Sliver^If He Cannot Be Turned^^The Duke^Report back to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.^It sounds like you did extremely well. And you secured three very important allies for the Knights of the Ebon Blade in the process. <Koltira gazes down at the map on the floor.> You should head back. By now, Baron Sliver and the other death knights will be fighting tooth and nail to hold The Shadow Vault against the might of the Scourge. I'm sure they'll need your help.Making a Harness^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Astrid Bjornrittar^Astrid Bjornrittar^They Took Our Men!^^The Last of Her Kind, The Slithering Darkness^Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to obtain 3 Icemane Yeti Hides.^So you want to ride? Well, if you've made it this far someone must think you've got a shot at the Hyldsmeet. First things first; we'll have to make you a harness. In the cliffs to the south, you'll find scattered groups of yeti. Their hides are tough and just the right thickness. Bring me some and we'll get you started on the path of the bear-rider.Making Something Out Of Nothing^76^All^Zul'Drak^Engineer Reed^Engineer Reed^^Crusader Forward Camp^^Engineer Reed at Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak has asked that you recover 10 pieces of Scourge Scrap Metal.^Prince Navarius must be stopped. We can't let the Scourge continue to use this area as a zombie factory. If we can get the tank operational we might stand a chance. What I need right now are spare parts. Northwest of here is an area called Thrym's End. The Scourge armies are using the area as a base of sorts. Spread out across the base is the wreckage from their arrival. Bits and pieces of Scourge scrap metal litter the landscape. Get that stuff to me and I'll try and put it to good use.In Search Of Answers^75^All^Zul'Drak^Crusader Lord Lantinga^Orders From Drakuru^In Search Of Answers^^^Search Rageclaw Den for a clue about who or what initiated the attacks against the Rageclaw Wolvar.^These poor creatures are the only survivors. According to their chief, the Drakkari trolls and Rageclaw wolvar have been allies for thousands of years. They've been living here, alongside the trolls, for generations, completely unaware of the ever changing world around them. To the Rageclaw, a troll is a troll, so the troll attack upon their den took them by surprise. We need some answers, <name>. Scour their village - southeast of here - for clues as to who or what is in charge of these attacks.That's What Friends Are For...^76^All^Zul'Drak^Crusader MacKellar^Crusader MacKellar^Crusader Forward Camp^^Light Won't Grant Me Vengeance^Crusader MacKellar at Crusader Forward Camp has asked that you find Crusader Dargath, Gerk and Burr.^We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, "If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all." He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen. I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them?Light Won't Grant Me Vengeance^76^All^Zul'Drak^Gerk^Gerk^^That's What Friends Are For...^^Gerk at Thrym's End in Zul'Drak wants you to kill 15 Vargul.^They... They killed my brother. <Gerk fights back tears.> Slaughtered him like he was some sort of animal. Now they got him laid out on one of their tables on the other side of the camp, ready for their grizzly experiments. Dargath's dead too. The paladin made a heroic stand at the ruins to the northeast, but the leader of the Vargul, Algar, was too strong. I'm all that's left and I'll be dead soon too. I... I'm turning. If the Light won't grant me vengeance, maybe you will, <class>. Kill them all.Mildred the Cruel^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Mildred the Cruel^They Took Our Men!^^^Speak to Mildred the Cruel inside the Forlorn Mine.^Our deal is made then, <name>. You help me get out of these chains and I'll help you find your little green friend. The Hyldnir who runs this mine is known as Mildred the Cruel -- and with good reason. Tell her you've been sent to lend a hand with the mines. Do whatever she asks until she trusts you with the keys to my shackles.Discipline^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Mildred the Cruel^Mildred the Cruel^They Took Our Men!^^^Mildred the Cruel at the Forlorn Mine wants you to use the Disciplining Rod on 6 Exhausted Vrykul.^Let's start you off with something straightforward. The male vrykul that work the mines for us do so against their will... purely out of fear of our blades. Once in a while, one of them will lose their motivation. Find any uncooperative vrykul and put them in their place. Take this disciplining rod. You'll want to inflict pain, not death. Well, most of the time anyway.Examples to be Made^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Mildred the Cruel^Mildred the Cruel^They Took Our Men!^^^Mildred the Cruel at the Forlorn Mine wants you to slay Garhal.^For every action there is an opposite reaction, sister. In the case of us applying pressure on the males, this has meant newly spread rumors of insurrection. The bearded pig behind this rabble-rousing is called Garhal. Put an end to him... and make sure the other males see his demise. They must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated.A Certain Prisoner^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Mildred the Cruel^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Take Mildred's Key to Lok'lira the Crone in the Forlorn Mine.^You are without mercy. You will do well around these parts. I have another task to ask of you. There is a female vrykul prisoner that's become more of a liability than I had anticipated. She had the gall to claim the right to take part in the Hyldsmeet, our sacred competition of strength and fighting prowess. Here's the key to her shackles. Make it as painless as possible. She's a female after all, even if not one of us.The Nose Knows^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Boktar Bloodfury^Khaliisi^The Missing Bronzebeard^^^Speak with Khaliisi at the foot of the mountain east of the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.^In order to track down Brann, we're going to need a creature with a keen sense of smell and a good tracking ability. There weren't any hounds on the zeppelin, but I think I have a substitute. After the crash, I sent Khaliisi down the east face of the mountain to start hunting for food. Her cat, Frostbite, excels at tracking prey in the snow. Tell her that she'll have to part with her companion for a while, at least. She can hunt on her own, but we have no other way of catching up to Brann Bronzebeard.Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Khaliisi^Brann Bronzebeard^The Missing Bronzebeard^^^Mount Frostbite and ride her to the source of the scent from Brann's note. Then, recover Brann's Communicator and use it to make contact with Brann Bronzebeard.^Boktar can have his way this time, but I'll expect him to make it up to me. Don't look at me like that. Boktar may be in command, but no one tells a hunter what to do. 'Put that beast away,' he says. 'Make it stop growling.' All of a sudden he changes his mind when it suits him. Next time he complains, Frostbite'll just nip him a bit. Don't worry, she'll do an admirable job tracking your prey. After she locates her target, you're on your own to deal with iron dwarves, or Brann, or whatever you find.A Great Storm Approaches^76^All^Zul'Drak^Gymer^Engineer Reed^A Great Storm Approaches^Crusader Forward Camp^^Gymer, King of Storm Giants, has asked you to find a way to release him from his cage. Speak with Engineer Reed at the Crusader Forward Camp.^You are not like the others, little one. You do not reek of the ancient death. Perhaps you can be trusted. I am Gymer, king of the storm giants. I was lured here by my brother, Thiassi, now an undead servant of the Lich King. By the time I realized that his cry for help was a trap, it was too late. I am now a prisoner of the Scourge and I fear that soon I will suffer the same fate as many of the other storm giants. Find a way to release me from this cage and I will aid you to the best of my ability.Speak Orcish, Man!^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Moteha Windborn^The Missing Bronzebeard^^^Speak with Moteha Windborn at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.^<Brann begins gesticulating wildly and rambling in his native language.> Ruk MogOth red a mogoth ta eft Thros-garE Haldir. Kha gor ruk khaz ta ke ruk hrim eft thros-am-kha ruk kost-um havar go kost. A modoss hine ruk bergum eft thros-am-kha ga eft Haldir ke loch Thon we lo gefrunon ta mitta.  Gar Ruk dagUm loch angor-magi ta har ruk! <After a few moments, you realize the conversation is going nowhere. Perhaps the shaman, Moteha Windborn, at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site will know what to do.>Gymer's Salvation^76^All^Zul'Drak^Engineer Reed^Engineer Reed^A Great Storm Approaches^^^Engineer Reed at Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak wants you to bring him 6 Banshee Essence and 6 Diatomaceous Earth.^Now you say that he's locked up in a 100 foot tall cage, eh? If my calculations are correct, we should be able to at least weaken the hinges on the cage, giving the giant enough leeway to break out. If this is going to work I'm going to need some plasticizers and stabilizers. Banshee essence should do nicely for the plasticizer. You can get that from the banshees in the Dead Fields, northeast of us. The stabilizer can be found on the earthragers to the southwest, near Ebon Watch. Get a move on!Mending Fences^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^The Last of Her Kind^^^Thorim at the Temple of Storms wants you to Kill Fjorn and 5 Stormforged Iron Giants at Fjorn's Anvil, east of Dun Niffelem.^If I hope to wrest control of the Temple of the Makers from my brother, I must make amends with my old allies. Perhaps by eliminating a common enemy, we may at least take a step towards renewing my friendship with the frost giants. Fjorn has besieged Dun Niffelem with giants of iron. You must defeat him at Fjorn's Anvil, far to the east of here, and weaken his forces sufficiently for the Sons of Hodir to emerge victorious. Take this charm, <name>. Use it to summon my earthen to your aid.Our Only Hope^76^All^Zul'Drak^Engineer Reed^Gymer^A Great Storm Approaches^^^Speak to Gymer at Thrym's End in Zul'Drak once you have used the Jumbo Seaforium Charge to open the Scourge Enclosure that is holding him prisoner.^What I'm about to give you is called seaforium. It is a highly volatile explosive with some unique properties. Due to its malleable nature, you will be able to fill in the hinges and cracks of the cage for maximum damage. Return to your friend and use the jumbo seaforium charge to set him free. Let's hope he honors the bargain. He's our only hope.Speaking with the Wind's Voice^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Moteha Windborn^Moteha Windborn^The Missing Bronzebeard^^Catching up with Brann^Bring 5 Voices of the Wind to Moteha Windborn at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.^I suppose we shouldn't have expected to find Brann so easily, not with our luck. If we can make sense of what Brann is saying, you can persuade him to give up his location. The power of the wind is strong in these mountains, and it may prove a great boon to us. A knowledgeable shaman can hear the sound of all the world's tongues on the wind. To the northwest, on the Snowdrift Plains, you will find beings made of wind, the stormriders. Capture their voices and bring them to me.Gem Perfection^65^Alliance^Jewelcrafting^Ounhulo^Ounhulo^^^^Return two Huge Citrines, two Dark Jade and two Shadow Crystals to Ounhulo in Valgarde.^It has the cold of the Icewyrm's breath up here does it not? Not only do I lack customers for my crafting skills, but I also lack stock of gems to sell! If you can bring me several uncut gems to replenish my stocks, I can teach you the skill of gem perfection. This will allow you to sometimes cut a perfect gem with increased bonuses when cutting a uncommon quality gem from Northrend.The Storm King's Vengeance^76^All^Zul'Drak^Gymer^Crusader MacKellar^A Great Storm Approaches^^^Speak with Gymer to begin.^My people have been decimated by the Lich King. The Scourge now use the corpses of storm giants to create mindless flesh giants, or worse, stitched together aberrations like Thrym. I will stop at nothing to see them all driven from this world. We will work together to destroy the Scourge that threaten Zul'Drak. We will kill them all: Navarius, Algar and Thrym! When you are ready, let me know and we will begin our destructive journey.Catching up with Brann^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Boktar Bloodfury^Boktar Bloodfury^Catching up with Brann^Speaking with the Wind's Voice^^Use Brann's Communicator to contact Brann Bronzebeard and speak with him, then speak to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.^What are you waiting for? The language barrier has been broken, thanks to Moteha. Contact Brann Bronzebeard and find out anything you can about where he's hiding and what he's chasing after. Maybe we can still salvage something from this disaster.A Change of Scenery^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Reconvene with Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village.^Excellent. There's an exit in the eastern end of the mine that leads to Brunnhildar Village. Follow it and I'll meet you there. We must not be seen together so no one suspects you of aiding me. I'll use my magic to disguise my appearance. Do not worry, <race> -- we'll find your friend in no time.The Refiner's Fire^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Slag Covered Metal^Fjorn's Anvil^The Refiner's Fire^^^You must collect 10 Furious Sparks from the Seething Revenants at Frostfield Lake and then use the anvil at Fjorn's Anvil.^Beneath its porous exterior, this hunk of metal gleams with a mysterious quality. You feel it would only be prudent to burn off the slag at Fjorn's Anvil. As you ponder where in this frozen waste you might find something hot enough for the job, a fire revenant crosses your path...Forging an Alliance^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Njormeld^Forging an Alliance^A Spark of Hope^^You are to go to Dun Niffelem and ask King Jokkum to allow Thorim's armor to be reforged. After completing Jokkum's task, you are to speak with Njormeld in Dun Niffelem.^<Thorim, for the first time since your meeting him, smiles.> This is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, <race>. Your discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the sons of Hodir are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators. Perhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes. Find your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance.Aberrations^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thyra Kvinnshal^Thyra Kvinnshal^^^The Aberrations Must Die^Thyra Kvinnshal in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and obtain Vials of Frost Oil from the Valkyrion Aspirants. Use the Vials of Frost Oil to destroy 30 Plagued Proto-Drake Eggs.^The Lich King sent emissaries to us on three different occasions. All three were promptly dismembered. Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the Scourge's advances. Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in. Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion Hyldnir carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find. Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept.Pieces of the Puzzle^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Boktar Bloodfury^Brann Bronzebeard^Catching up with Brann^^^Use Brann's Communicator to contact Brann Bronzebeard and find out what to do next.^We've seen the iron dwarves and their constructs making war on the creatures of stone that Brann calls the earthen, along with their giant allies. Contact him and aid him in any way you can, and remember that anything we can learn from his search may aid us in fighting against the iron dwarves and their master.Data Mining^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Brann Bronzebeard^Catching up with Brann^^^Use the Inventor's Disk to retrieve 7 pieces of Hidden Data from the Databanks.^That disk you assembled... it's blank! Keeper Mimir, the tinker who built this library, must've hidden the information elsewhere. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there? That might be the disk's purpose. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key.Norgannon's Shell^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Inventor's Library Console^Brann Bronzebeard^Catching up with Brann^^The Earthen of Ulduar, Going After the Core^Recover Norgannon's Shell from Archivist Mechaton.^Charging inventor's disk. Disk charging completed. Preparing emergency protocol gamma. Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified. Please have a pleasant millennium.The Earthen of Ulduar^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^^Norgannon's Shell^^Speak with Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^The earthen who once inhabited, built, and maintained Ulduar were ousted from their home when Loken took over the city. Since then, his iron dwarf followers have relentlessly attacked the exiles. They have taken refuge in an old titan building, which they now call Bouldercrag's Refuge, on the face of a mountain west of the Inventor's Library. Bouldercrag and his brethren fight to keep the irons from overrunning their haven, but they cannot hold their ground long. Find and help them, <name>.Rare Earth^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Rare Earth^^Fighting Back, Relief for the Fallen^Use the Earthen Mining Pick to mine 7 clumps of Enchanted Earth. Bring the earth and 5 Frostweave Cloth to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^It seems so long ago that these hammers pounded and hewed stone instead of iron. Our expulsion from Ulduar saw the weakest of us dead and the strongest of our craftsmen reborn as warriors. As the irons beat us back, even the strongest find themselves failing. We can do little for the wounded, save when we have a stock of enchanted earth. We used to mine it from the deposits on the sheer cliff face to the northwest, but the constant battle has prevented us from replenishing our stock. Would you help?Fighting Back^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Rare Earth^^Slaves of the Stormforged, The Dark Ore^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper wants you to slay 10 Stormforged Attackers and return to him at Bouldercrag's Refuge. You may kill either Stormforged Raiders or Stormforged Reavers.^The refuge's defenders have done their best to blunt the iron dwarves' attacks, but we keep losing ground inch by inch. My men are hardy, but not tireless. Without reinforcements, it's only a matter of time until we will be overrun. Would you lend your skills to the refuge's defense? It would greatly improve the morale of the defenders and give them -- and me -- hope of mounting a counterattack. Kill any of the stormforged or their creations you encounter outside the refuge.The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Champion's Call!^^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Yggdras! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand. These trolls are dirtier than ogres; but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Zul'Drak, pal. You're new to this racket, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match. If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say?The Amphitheater of Anguish: Magnataur!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^^The Amphitheater of Anguish: From Beyond^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Stinkbeard! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^This next match is a doozy, buddy! Apparently some magnataur from the Dragonblight wants a piece of the action. You ever fought one of those before? All I can tell you is to aim high! We'll get this party started when you give me the word.The Amphitheater of Anguish: From Beyond!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Magnataur!^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Tuskarrmage^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat one of the elemental lords! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^I'm not gonna lie to you, pal. You might be overmatched here. This next one is a being from the elemental planes! I don't even know what's gonna show up in that arena! If you think you're up to it, get in there and give 'em hell!The Amphitheater of Anguish: Tuskarrmageddon!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Amphitheater of Anguish: From Beyond^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Korrak the ^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Orinoko Tuskbreaker! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^This next one's fightin' from a dark place, kid. The kind of dark that can only happen when you've been on the flip-side. He's hungry and willing to do whatever it takes to win. Watch yourself! I've heard he wrestles yetis for exercise! We'll start when you're ready.The Amphitheater of Anguish: Korrak the Bloodrager!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Tuskarrmage^The Champion of Anguish^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Korrak the Bloodrager! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^You're not gonna believe this, pal. Your next fight is against Korrak the Bloodrager! Looks like the Drakkari trolls are pulling a power play! And let me tell you, buddy, he's been sippin' the animal god juice. He's good and ready to pound you into the ground. Are you ready?Relief for the Fallen^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^^Rare Earth^^Use the Telluric Poultice to heal 8 Fallen Earthen Defenders, then return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^The refuge's defenders fight bravely, but they cannot keep up with the iron onslaught. With the earth you collected, I can make bandages to help heal the wounds of some of the fallen. The more defenders we can patch up, the longer we'll last out there. Take these poultices and use them to heal the wounds of the fallen defenders outside the refuge. Get as many back into the battle as possible, <name>. Every casualty is one too many.The Duke^80^All^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Duke Lankral^If He Cannot Be Turned^^Eliminate the Competition^Speak with Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault.^We need you focused, <name>. We're barely holding The Shadow Vault as it is. As you can see, we've greatly angered the Lich King. <The baron chuckles.> I need you to speak with Duke Lankral. He's in charge here now. You'll find him inside the vault building proper. Were I you, I would not keep him waiting.Honor Challenge^80^All^Icecrown^Duke Lankral^Duke Lankral^If He Cannot Be Turned^^Get the Key^Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault has asked you to use the Challenge Flag to challenge and defeat 6 Mjordin Combatants.^The first step we're going to take is at a place in Jotunheim called the Savage Ledge. It's just over the mountains to the west. On the ledge the vrykul warriors are always sparring, being instructed in the finer arts of battle by their thane's men. I want you to take this flag and issue a challenge to a number of them. Let's demoralize them with the 'mere' skills of a <race>, shall we? <The duke grins, his rotting teeth flashing in the dim light of the vault.>Off With Their Black Wings^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Iva the Vengeful^Iva the Vengeful^^^^Iva the Vengeful in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and slay 12 Nascent Val'kyr.^Traitors. We Hyldnir have little love for them. The dwellers of Valkyrion have gone unpunished for far too long. While we remained loyal to Thorim, they became the Lich King's lapdogs! They call the ones who receive his gift val'kyr. They fly on feathered wings, like the harpies they are. You will find Valkyrion far to the northwest, beyond the Temple of Storms. Slay these winged she-wolves, sister. Slay them and I will reward you with one of my most prized possessions.Shadow Vault Decree^80^All^Icecrown^Duke Lankral^Duke Lankral^If He Cannot Be Turned^^^Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault has ordered you to read the Shadow Vault Decree in the presence of Thane Ufrang the Mighty, and then to slay him.^Thane Ufrang the Mighty sits within his hall overlooking the Savage Ledge. I've studied him. The thane is a patient vrykul, with a head for strategy and warfare. He's also shown a penchant for biding his time and not wanting to overplay his hand in the ongoing battle. I need him dead! I've written a decree. Stand before the thane and read it aloud. <The duke arches his eyebrow in amusement.> It should... unnerve him at the least.The Champion of Anguish^78^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Korrak the ^^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Vladof the Butcher! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^This is the end, my friend! Your last opponent is going to be your greatest challenge. He's a vrykul champion from the steppes of Icecrown and he's out for blood! Defeat him and you'll be crowned the champion of the Amphitheater of Anguish! This fight is going to make us both rich! Let me know when you're ready and we'll start.Get the Key^80^All^Icecrown^Vaelen the Flayed^Vaelen the Flayed^Get the Key^Honor Challenge^^Vaelen the Flayed at Ufrang's Hall has asked you to retrieve the Key to Vaelen's Chains.^<class>, the key to my shackles is hanging around the neck of Instructor Hroegar outside. Perhaps you could retrieve it by separating his head from his shoulders?Let the Baron Know^80^All^Icecrown^Vaelen the Flayed^Baron Sliver^Get the Key^^^Speak with Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.^The most important thing that you can do right now is to return to The Shadow Vault and let Baron Sliver know that I've failed. You see, I wasn't the only one captured by these vrykul devils. My entire contingent of death knights was also taken. I should have seen the trap before it was sprung, but there's no use crying over spilled milk now is there? Go on before you get captured, too! I'll see you back at the vault.Gem Perfection^65^Horde^Jewelcrafting^Carter Tiffens^Carter Tiffens^^^^Return two Huge Citrines, two Dark Jade and two Shadow Crystals to Carter Tiffens in Vengeance Landing.^My skills are going to waste in this wretched place. I spent many years learning to cut gems into their perfect form and have nothing to work on! You look like the type who may be able to find me some gems and if you do I can teach you the skill of gem perfection. This will allow you to sometimes cut a perfect gem with increased bonuses when cutting a uncommon quality gem from Northrend.Valkyrion Must Burn^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Harpoon Crate^Iva the Vengeful^^^^Use the Valkyrion Harpoon Guns to burn 6 Dry Haystacks.^The crate is filled with incendiary harpoons. You recall seeing harpoon guns and dry stacks of hay outside. Perhaps Iva will appreciate the extra effort and reward you appropriately.The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Gurgthock^Wodin the Troll-Servant^^The Ring of Blood: The Final Challenge^^Get in the arena at the Amphitheater of Anguish and defeat Yggdras! Return to Wodin the Troll-Servant to redeem your reward.^I was wondering when you'd show up, <name>! Having a past champion of the Ring of Blood here will be a huge draw! We're gonna be rich, buddy! RICH! Anyway, this dump is Zul'Drak. All the ice trolls seem to use it as a toilet. I dunno, the whole place is off its rocker if you ask me! Who cares, though, right? We're here to make some gold! You know the drill, <name>. When you're ready let me know and we'll get this show on the road!Eliminate the Competition^80^All^Icecrown^The Leaper^The Leaper^Eliminate the Competition^The Duke^^The Leaper at The Shadow Vault wants you to duel and defeat Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun and Tinky Wickwhistle.^Mrrfrmrfrrmrrr... <The Leaper clears his throat.> Sorry about that. It can sometimes be hard to understand what I'm saying. You know how it is. I wanted to make sure that if you find yourself at the Savage Ledge, over the mountains to the west, that you make sure to eliminate the competition there. Specifically, I'd like you to challenge to duels and humiliate Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun, and Tinky Wickwhistle in front of the vrykul.A Spark of Hope^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Fjorn's Anvil^Thorim^The Refiner's Fire^^Forging an Alliance^You are to bring the Refined Gleaming Ore to Thorim in the Temple of Storms.^Clearly, this is more than an ordinary hunk of metal. Unlike any ore you're familiar with, it is hard but not brittle, far lighter than it looks, and glows even when cool. Looking closer, you can make out one of Thorim's runes shining beneath the surface....Slaves of the Stormforged^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^^Fighting Back^The Gifts of Loken, Facing the Storm^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to free 6 Captive Mechagnomes and kill 3 Stormforged Taskmasters.^To the southwest, on the western side of the Snowdrift Plains, the iron dwarves have dug a mine into the hillside. There, they use captive mechagnomes, servants of Keeper Mimir, to mine ore. I don't know where these mechagnomes came from, nor what they would do with their freedom, but perhaps we can win their help. Go to the Frozen Mine, <name>, and set these creatures free from their bondage. Ask if they would fight alongside us against iron dwarf tyranny.Shipment: Blood Jade Amulet^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^Finish the Shipment^^Combine a Vrykul Amulet, a Dark Jade and a Bloodstone to make a Blood Jade Amulet and bring it to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Blood Jade Amulets to sell at Undermine. If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.Shipment: Glowing Ivory Figurine^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^Finish the Shipment^^Combine Northern Ivory, a Chalcedony and a Shadow Crystal to create a Glowing Ivory Figurine and bring it to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Glowing Ivory Figurines to sell at Undermine. If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.Shipment: Wicked Sun Brooch^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^Finish the Shipment^^Combine an Iron Dwarf Brooch, a Huge Citrine and a Sun Crystal to create a Wicked Sun Brooch and bring it to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Wicked Sun Brooches to sell at Undermine. If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.Shipment: Intricate Bone Figurine^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^Finish the Shipment^^Combine a Proto Dragon Bone, a Sun Crystal and a Dark Jade to craft an Intricate Bone Figurine and bring it to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Intricate Bone Figurines to sell at Undermine. If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.Shipment: Bright Armor Relic^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^Finish the Shipment^^Combine an Elemental Armor Scrap, a Bloodstone and a Huge Citrine to craft a Bright Armor Relic and bring it to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Bright Armor Relics to sell at Undermine. If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.Shipment: Shifting Sun Curio^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^Finish the Shipment^^Combine a Scourge Curio, a Sun Crystal and a Shadow Crystal to make a Shifting Sun Curio and bring it to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Shifting Sun Curios to sell at Undermine. If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.The Dark Ore^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^^Fighting Back^^Bring 5 Ore Samples to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^At the Frozen Mine in the western part of the Snowdrift Plains, the stormforged iron dwarves have constructed a mine manned by slaves. It's well behind the lines, so we haven't been able to find out much about what's going on there, but my scouts have reported seeing them remove cartloads of dark, sickly looking ore.The Gifts of Loken^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^^Slaves of the Stormforged^^Destroy Loken's Fury, Loken's Power, and Loken's Favor, and return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^The one who commands the stormforged iron dwarves is called Runeseer Valduran. Although I have never seen them, it is said that his master, Keeper Loken, who took over Ulduar, has given Valduran powerful titan artifacts. It could explain the strength and ferocity my men see in the stormforged warriors. Valduran's base, Nidavelir, lies to the southwest, across the Snowdrift Plains. Go there, <name>, and neutralize his power. Destroy these gifts of Loken's and help us to sap the strength of his followers.You Can't Miss Him^80^All^The Storm Peaks^King Jokkum^Njormeld^You Can't Miss Him^^^King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to find Njormeld at Fjorn's Anvil.^<Jokkum listens patiently to your request, then ponders it carefully before responding.> So it is you we have to thank for Fjorn's demise? While it's true that you have aided us in our time of need, there is still much that must be done to repair our relations with Thorim. For now, I shall allow Njormeld to reforge the armor we gifted to the Stormlord so many ages ago. Consider it payment for your assistance against Fjorn. Njormeld was sent to recover Fjorn's anvil. You should find him there.Battling the Elements^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Njormeld^Njormeld^You Can't Miss Him^^Hot and Cold^Njormeld wants you to accompany Snorri to Fjorn's anvil and help him kill 10 Seething Revenants.^Snorri was once the pride of our nation. A mighty warrior, many an enemy fell to his club. We honor him, though he's no longer what he once was. Age has taken its toll, dulling his senses and sapping his strength. Still, he remains as proud as ever, never missing an opportunity to join a battle. Speaking of battle, we're cooling Fjorn's anvil so it can be taken home. The remaining fire revenants are putting up some resistance. Help Snorri relive his glory days, <race>. Guide him against this enemy.Yulda's Folly^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Iva the Vengeful^Iva the Vengeful^^^^Iva the Vengeful at Brunnhildar Village wants you to slay Yulda the Stormspeaker in Valkyrion.^The witch that started it all, Yulda the Stormspeaker came to our very village. She dared to insult our noble traditions and spouted the Lich King's venomous promises of power. She ought to have left with a sword through her, but her magic was strong and she managed to escape. Seek her in Valkyrion inside the largest dwelling and show her that we are not to be trifled with.Is That Your Goblin?^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Challenge Agnetta Tyrsdottar in order to save Zeev Fizzlespark. Return to Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village after you've succeeded.^I trust that's the green little one you've been looking for. If I were you I'd step in before that Hyldnir splits him in half. You've arrived in the middle of the Hyldsmeet, so all challenges must be accepted by participants. There's nothing to stop you from taking your green friend's place.The Hyldsmeet^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Listen to Lok'lira the Crone's proposal.^Whether you've noticed or not, by defeating your first Hyldnir in hand-to-hand combat, you've entered the Hyldsmeet -- the great competition of Hyldnir against Hyldnir to determine who will rule by Thorim's side. The Hyldsmeet is the reason why I was imprisoned, for I sought to partake in the competition but was far too old and frail to be a match for the Hyldnir. If you're willing to listen, I've a proposal for you.Taking on All Challengers^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Lok'lira the Crone^They Took Our Men!^^^Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village wants you to defeat 6 Victorious Challengers.^Let's get you started. The good news is that by defeating Agnetta, you've earned yourself a spot in the next round of matches. The bad news is that all your opponents will also have defeated someone in the first round. Do not expect pushovers.You'll Need a Bear^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Lok'lira the Crone^Brijana^They Took Our Men!^^^Speak to Brijana outside Brunnhildar Village.^You've succeeded in the first rounds of the Hyldsmeet. To advance further, you're going to need a warbear of your own. Unfortunately, the Hyldnir don't give them out to just anyone. You'll have to emerge victorious from true battle, not just gladiatorial combat. The Hyldnir of Brunnhildar are currently involved in a feud against the Sons of Hodir, Thorim's former allies. Speak to Brijana just outside the village and see how you can help them and prove yourself in the process.The Brothers Bronzebeard^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Velog Icebellow^^^^Accompany Brann Bronzebeard and his flying machine to Frosthold.^That does it! We finally have the keystone... It's beautiful! I've been around the world more than once, but this thing's got me all jittery with excitement again. I suppose now's not the time to stop and admire though, we need to get the heck out of here. Hop on my flying machine and help keep us covered from those iron dwarves on the way out!The Champion's Call!^77^All^Zul'Drak^Shifty Vickers^Gurgthock^^^The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras!^Seek out Gurgthock at the Amphitheater of Anguish in Zul'Drak.^Pfft, what happens down here ain't fightin'. It's a couple of guys dancin' around a flag. You lookin' for some real action, buddy? 'Cause if you are I got the hottest ticket in town. Ever heard of Gurgthock and Wodin? Goblin and troll who ran the Ring of Blood back in Outland? Well they're here in Northrend and they've started up a whole new fight club over in Zul'Drak. If you're interested go to Zul'Drak, east of Crystalsong. They're at the big arena in the center. Tell 'em Shifty sent ya!In Memoriam^80^All^The Storm Peaks^King Jokkum^King Jokkum^In Memoriam^^^King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to collect 8 Horn Fragments from Thunderfall.^Surely Thorim has told you of the tragedy that divides us. It was in Thunderfall, northeast of here, that these events unfolded. The frozen fossils there are a reminder of that dark day, as are the spirits that haunt that place. If my people are to forgive Thorim, something must take the place of those images. A memorial must be constructed to bring our hearts peace. Go there, <race>. Collect the fragments of Hodir's Horn that was shattered that day.A Monument to the Fallen^80^All^The Storm Peaks^King Jokkum^Njormeld^In Memoriam^^Blowing Hodir's Horn^King Jokkum wants you to bring Hodir's Horn Fragments to Njormeld in Dun Niffelem.^Bring these fragments to Njormeld. He will use the pieces of that sacred relic in the construction of a mighty monument. May it soothe the pains and heal the scars my people have borne these many years. May its presence help to bring about a new age that sees us once again in glorious battle at Thorim's side. Go now, <class>. Njormeld awaits you.Blowing Hodir's Horn^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Hodir's Horn^Hodir's Horn^^A Monument to the Fallen^^You are to defeat 5 Niffelem Forefathers and 5 Restless Frostborn at Thunderfall. You are then to blow Hodir's Horn over their corpses, then return to Hodir's Horn in Dun Niffelem.^You have done a great service to the giants of Dun Niffelem. Without your aid, this monument would not exist. As you silently ponder its significance, feelings begin to flood your heart. The feelings fill your mind with thoughts and images... as well as a sense of urgency. The sensations fade and leave you with a knowledge of what you must do. The restless spirits at Thunderfall must be put to rest. As you set off, you find that your hands have been filled with an ethereal horn.Facing the Storm^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bruor Ironbane^Bruor Ironbane^^Slaves of the Stormforged^^Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to kill 10 Nidavelir Stormforged. You may kill Stormforged Champions, Stormforged Magi, or Stormforged War Golems.^Like Bouldercrag, I once served the keepers as a craftsman in Ulduar, but with Loken's betrayal, I turned my hammer toward our new foes. When we could spare the men, I led raids on Nidavelir to relieve the pressure on our defenders, but our lines are near collapse. You've proven yourself a capable combatant and a staunch ally. Perhaps you'd be willing to take up our banner and take the fight to Nidavelir, the iron dwarf stronghold to the southwest, across the Snowdrift Plains.Armor of Darkness^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Dark Armor Plate^Bruor Ironbane^Armor of Darkness^^^Bring 4 Dark Armor Samples to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade. Why would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems? Perhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems.The Armor's Secrets^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bruor Ironbane^Bruor Ironbane^Armor of Darkness^^Valduran the Stormborn^Take the Dark Armor Plate to Mimir's Workshop and ask Attendant Tock to examine it. When you're finished, return to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^The presence of that armor plate is disorienting, but we need to find out all we can from it. It could be part of one of Valduran's schemes. He's dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort to mining, refining, smithing, and testing this metal. To the east, along the northern mountain face, is a building called Mimir's Workshop. It hasn't been used in quite some time, but if we're lucky, some of its attendants are still functional. Take your armor plate there and learn what you can from it.Hot and Cold^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Fjorn's Anvil^Fjorn's Anvil^^Battling the Elements^^You are to go to Frostfield Lake, kill the Brittle Revenants there and use the Essence of Ice on the Smoldering Scraps at Fjorn's Anvil. You are then to collect 6 of the Frozen Iron scraps and return to Fjorn's Anvil in Dun Niffelem.^As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here. It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape - shrapnel from the battle fought there. If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war.Ebon Blade Prisoners^80^All^Icecrown^Vaelen the Flayed^Vaelen the Flayed^Vaelen Has Returned^^^Vaelen the Flayed at The Shadow Vault wants you to free 8 Ebon Blade Prisoners. They can be found in the cages throughout the greater Jotunheim region.^Now that I'm back, I'm certain that the baron will want me to recover my men. I can see that we're barely hanging on here. The Lich King's forces are about to break through and we won't be able to hold without my captured death knights. Can you assist me once more, <name>? Go back to Jotunheim and let them out of those cages. Break the damn locks, I don't care what you have to do. The vrykul likely have the keys. Just get my men free!The Last of Her Kind^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Astrid Bjornrittar^Astrid Bjornrittar^The Last of Her Kind^Making a Harness^^Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to rescue an Icemaw Matriarch in the Hibernal Cavern.^For as long as I can remember, we've obtained our best bears from the Hibernal Cave to the east. Those times might finally be gone. The cave has been overrun by ravenous jormungar and the wild bears are all but extinct. If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity. Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch. Good luck finding one.Valduran the Stormborn^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Valduran the Stormborn^The Armor's Secrets^Destroy the Forges!, Hit Them Where it Hurts^Use Bouldercrag's War Horn when you have found Valduran the Stormborn. Defeat Valduran the Stormborn and return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^We have no choice, <name>. What you learned in Mimir's Workshop means that we must act before Valduran can complete and unleash his new weapon. Even now, the refuge's defenders fight to buy us time to deal with Valduran the Stormborn. You must go to Nidavelir, across the Snowdrift Plains to the southwest, and then find and face Valduran. But you will not be alone. Bring this war horn with you and sound it as you prepare to face the leader of our enemies. Bruor and I will aid you in this battle.Forging a Head^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Njormeld^Njormeld^Forging a Head^^^Njormeld in Dun Niffelem needs you to use the Diamond Tipped Pick on the Dead Iron Giants at Frostfield Lake and return to him when you have collected 8 Stormforged Eyes.^Greetings, <race>. I have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people. I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies. Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields.Fate of the Titans^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Creteus^Creteus^Aid from the Explorers' League^^^Creteus in the Foot Steppes has requested that you travel to the Temple of Invention, the Temple of Winter, the Temple of Life, and the Temple of Order and utilize the databank to examine each area.^Norgannon's Core is not at this location. I am not sure why you seek it, <race>, and I am equally unsure if you truly know the purpose of that which you seek. I would like you to aid me before I consider extending my assistance. I have recently encountered knowledge of the watcher, Thorim. His seat of power is contested, and his fate remains to be seen. This troubles me, for I do not know of the other watchers. Utilize this databank to examine their temples to the northeast and return the knowledge to me.Mounting Hodir's Helm^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Njormeld^Njormeld^Forging a Head^^Polishing the Helm^Njormeld wants you to fly to the tip of the northern ice spike in Dun Niffelem and use the Tablets of Pronouncement.^The helm is forged. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, small one. Though there remains much to do, we sons of Hodir are grateful for your accomplishments. In return, I offer you the opportunity to present Hodir's helm to our king and our brethren. Fly to the sparkling tip of the small ice spike in front of me and read to our people from this tablet. Enjoy the privilege, <class>. Never before has an outsider been given such an honor!Destroy the Forges!^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Valduran the Stormborn^^A Colossal Threat^Destroy the North Lightning Forge, the Central Lightning Forge, and the South Lightning Forge with Bouldercrag's Bombs, then return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^In my folly, I'd thought Valduran's project at Narvir's Cradle, a large construction area to the south, no more than a grotesque monument to "Keeper" Loken's cruelty. Now we know the truth, that it was meant to be used as a weapon against us and our allies. We must not allow this iron colossus to reach completion, <name>, for it will mean the end of the refuge. Go to Narvir's Cradle, find the lightning forges the stormforged artisans use, and sabotage them.The Slithering Darkness^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Astrid Bjornrittar^Astrid Bjornrittar^^Making a Harness^^Astrid Bjornrittar wants you to slay 8 Ravenous Jormungar in the Hibernal Cavern east of Brunnhildar Village.^The vile jormungar have taken over most of the Hibernal Cavern. They are despicable beings... children of Loken, Thorim's scumsucker of a brother. As Thorim's servants we owe it to ourselves to kill these scum where we find them. You'll find the cavern just east of here, outside the village.Hit Them Where it Hurts^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bruor Ironbane^Bruor Ironbane^^Valduran the Stormborn^^Kill 10 Stormforged Artificers and return to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^Bouldercrag's got a good plan to stymie the efforts of the iron dwarves at Narvir's Cradle, and I've got an idea of my own. Work on the iron colossus will come to a halt without any artisans. Narvir's Cradle is on the south side of the hill sheltering Bouldercrag's Refuge. Go there and slay any stormforged artificers in your path. They may be no different from what we once were, but they build a weapon that threatens us all.Crush Dem Vrykuls!^80^All^Icecrown^Vile^Vile^Crush Dem Vrykuls!^^Vaelen Has Returned^Vile at The Shadow Vault wants you to slay any 15 vrykul in the greater Jotunheim region.^Dem vrykuls at the Jotunheim needs to be crushed! <name> crush dems good!A Colossal Threat^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^A Colossal Threat^Destroy the Forges!^The Heart of the Storm^Retrieve the Colossus Attack Specs and Colossus Defense Specs and bring them to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^You've done an excellent job of delaying the work on the iron colossus, but I fear we've only made the stormforged more determined to complete the weapon. Even now, they're bringing in new laborers and the overseers push them to the limit. We may not be able to keep them from bringing the colossus online, after all. Return to Narvir's Cradle, to the south and find the documents detailing the colossus' offensive and defensive abilities. They should be near the tents and forges on the bottom level.Spy Hunter^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Frostworg Denmother^Frostworg Denmother^^^^You must defeat 3 Stormforged Spies in the Valley of Ancient Winters.^The rapport you've developed with the inhabitants of Dun Niffelem has yielded some unexpected discoveries. For example, you somehow find yourself able to understand the denmother's guttural growls and sharp quips - at least you think you do. It would seem that she senses danger outside the stronghold and wants you to do something about it. With her forepaw, she removes the chain from around her neck and lets it drop at your feet. As you pick it up you notice an aged fang attached to it....Leave Our Mark^80^All^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Baron Sliver^^Vandalizing Jotunheim^^Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault wishes you to plant 15 Ebon Blade Banners near the corpses of vrykul found within the greater Jotunheim region.^We must attack the vrykul of Jotunheim on many levels. Brute force, of course, is good, but I prefer a more cerebral approach. I want you to demoralize them. My men here have forged a number of banners for you. I would like for you to take and plant them near the corpses of fallen vrykul. Let the banners serve as a constant reminder to them that they face a more immediate threat than the wrath of the Lich King.The Warm-Up^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Astrid Bjornrittar^Astrid Bjornrittar^The Last of Her Kind^^^Astrid Bjornrittar in Brunnhildar Village wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch to defeat Kirgaraak.^You've been very fortunate, sister. This is a matriarch the likes of which hasn't been seen in years. A good bear won't do you much good without the skill to ride it. I'm going to have you practice some moves on Kirgaraak. He's the largest yeti we've ever managed to capture so be careful. Don't be afraid to walk away if he gives you a beating... there's a reason why we keep him chained.Into the Pit^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Astrid Bjornrittar^Astrid Bjornrittar^The Last of Her Kind^^Back to the Pit^Astrid Bjornrittar, in Brunnhildar Village, wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch inside the Pit of the Fang and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears.^Besting a tethered opponent is one thing. Fighting other bear riders on equal footing is another. Head into the Pit of the Fang and use what you've learned to defeat your opponents. Good luck, sister. Glory awaits, should you succeed.The Heart of the Storm^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^A Colossal Threat^^^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to travel to Uldis and try to prevent Overseer Narvir from obtaining the Heart of the Storm.^According to the documents you captured at Narvir's Cradle, the iron colossus is complete except for one key component -- the Heart of the Storm. Without it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus! Notes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the Bor's Breath River.The Bone Witch^80^All^Icecrown^The Leaper^The Bone Witch^Eliminate the Competition^^Deep in the Bowels of The Underhalls^Speak with The Bone Witch within the cave at Njorndar Village.^You remember Lady Nightswood, don't you? She certainly remembers you. She's the forlorn and very angry banshee that you 'saved' when you also broke Vile and myself out from under the Lich King's dominion. The lady has gone into Jotunheim and possessed their bone witch. She intends to wreak havoc upon the vrykul from within. She has asked that you seek her out. You'll find her in the cave on the south side of Njorndar Village to the southwest within Jotunheim.Emergency Measures^79^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Bloodguard Lorga^Bloodguard Lorga^^^^Bloodguard Lorga wants you to go to the Gimorak's Den to the east and obtain 6 Worg Furs.^The cold in these mountains is brutal. We have a day or two before we burn up all the wood from the wreckage. We spotted worgs inside a cave directly east of here. I need you to find the cave and obtain some furs. It might not sound like much, but it might be the difference between freezing to death and living another day. Worgs don't hunt alone, so I'm giving you a flare. It should buy you some time if you find yourself outnumbered.Raising Hodir's Spear^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Lorekeeper Randvir^Lorekeeper Randvir^^^Thrusting Hodir's Spear^Lorekeeper Randvir in Dun Niffelem wants you to collect 3 Everfrost Shards from the depths of Hibernal Cavern and 3 Stoic Mammoth Hides from the Stoic Mammoths in the Valley of Ancient Winters.^The time has come, little <class>. The stars have foretold of this day. I have received a vision from mighty Hodir himself, revealing the secret to the creation of a great artifact. We must obey! Were we to fail in receiving this gift, doom would surely follow. I call upon you to assist me in this sacred undertaking. Go across the valley, deep into the Hibernal Cavern and gather everfrost shards from the icy crater there, then collect hides from the mammoths outside the cavern.Gem Perfection^65^Horde^Jewelcrafting^Geba'li^Geba'li^^^^Return two Huge Citrines, two Dark Jade and two Shadow Crystals to Geba'li in Warsong Hold.^Welcome to de cold, mon. Dis place may not be so good for keepin' me bones warm, but I have learned how to cut me de perfect gem. All I be needin' is some gems to do me work on. Bring me some gems and I be teachin' you the skill of gem perfection. Dis will allow you to sometimes cut a perfect gem with increased bonuses when cuttin' an uncommon quality gem from Northrend.Thrusting Hodir's Spear^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Hodir's Spear^Hodir's Spear^^Raising Hodir's Spear^^You are to use Hodir's Spear to challenge a Wild Wyrm in the Valley of Ancient Winters. Once in its grip, you are to fight to the death.^Hodir's Spear is an icon of great prowess in battle. Its mere presence instills a deep hunger for glory in all who enter Dun Niffelem. In fact, simply being near it has compelled you to test your own abilities. Scanning the horizon, your vision locks on a wild wyrm as it flies nearby. It is decided. Of you and he, only one shall see the next sunrise....Gem Perfection^65^Alliance^Jewelcrafting^Alestos^Alestos^^^^Return two Huge Citrines, two Dark Jade and two Shadow Crystals to Alestros in Valiance Keep.^There's a war going on and we each must do our part! Mine is cutting gems and not only can I cut normal gems but I have the skill to cut perfect gems as well. If you can bring me several uncut gems to contribute to the cause, I can teach you gem perfection as well. This will allow you to sometimes cut a perfect gem with increased bonuses when cutting a uncommon quality gem from Northrend.The Earthen Oath^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^^^^Thorim, at the Terrace of the Makers, wants you to use the Horn of the Peaks and call on the Earthen to defeat 20 Iron Dwarves and 7 Iron Sentinels.^For years I neglected my duties, giving into defeat and self-pity. Not the brave earthen, however. Their oath to protect these grounds with their lives has gone unbroken. Even now, they fight the corruption of iron with selflessness, waiting for the moment in which the tides turn. That moment has arrived. We must rally what remains of the earthen defenders and lead them into a glorious victory. Sound the Horn of the Peaks to call them to your side and take back the Terrace of the Makers.Polishing the Helm^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Hodir's Helm^Hodir's Helm^^Mounting Hodir's Helm^^You are to enter Hibernal Cavern west of Dun Niffelem and collect 5 units of Viscous Oil from the Viscous Oils there.^As you draw near the helm, you notice that the frigid environment is already taking its toll on the artifact's surface. What is now just a thin layer of ice will surely grow to envelop it entirely. Not about to let your hard efforts go to waste, you resolve to scour the region in search of a solution. Just as you set off, the eyes of the helm flash and an image of the nearby Hibernal Cavern enters your mind.The Iron Colossus^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^Bouldercrag the Rockshaper^A Colossal Threat^^^Use a Tamed Jormungar to defeat the Iron Colossus and return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.^We have failed to prevent the completion of the iron colossus, <name>, which means we have no choice but to face it in battle. Bruor has devised a plan to exploit the colossus' only weakness. No matter how tough the colossus' armor is, it is still vulnerable to a jormungar's acid. Take control of one using the orbs along the northern edge of the Snowdrift Plains, then use it to fight the Iron Colossus on the Snowdrift Plains. If you need help controlling the creature, speak to one of the nearby handlers.Scourge Tactics^78^All^Icecrown^Crusade Commander Entari^Crusade Commander Entari^Honor Above All Else^^If There Are Survivors...^Crusade Commander Entari at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown has asked that you free 8 Webbed Crusaders.^We had the element of surprise on our side! We blew a hole in the side of the mountain and charged into Scourgeholme. Scourge opposition was fierce and it wasn't long until we were overwhelmed. We fell back to the valley and began raining artillery down on the Scourge that followed. This held them back for awhile until... Those monsters began using crusaders as living shields. We had to stop shelling for fear of killing our own soldiers. Free our crusaders trapped on the field outside the base, <class>!A New Beginning^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Njormeld^Thorim^Forging an Alliance^^^Njormeld wants you to take the Reforged Armor to Thorim at the Temple of Storms.^It remains uncertain whether or not our people can ever rekindle the affection we once held for Thorim. May this armor, if nothing else, remind him of the days when we stood together in honor, invincible.Krolmir, Hammer of Storms^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^Forging an Alliance^^^Thorim wants you to talk to King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem and discover what he knows of Krolmir.^One task remains before I can reclaim my home at the Terrace of the Makers. Krolmir must be found. On that fateful day, I threw it to the earth with all the power and rage I possessed. A mighty explosion followed. I've thought it lost for these many years, but now I must be certain. Return to King Jokkum and discover what, if anything, he knows of my hammer's fate.Jormuttar is Soo Fat...^80^All^The Storm Peaks^King Jokkum^King Jokkum^^^^King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem wants you to slay Jormuttar in Hibernal Cavern.^I have an opportunity that will help you to gain approval with my people, provided you prevail. The jormungar are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire. They have appeared southwest of here, in the Hibernal Cavern. If their spawnmother is not slain soon, they will gain a foothold in our region. She cannot refuse food. Take this knife and get the flank of a bear corpse from their cave. Place it near her crater and kill her as she feeds.The Witness and the Hero^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Xarantaur^Xarantaur^Xarantaur, the Witness^^^Xarantaur, at Camp Tunka'lo, wants you to read the First History Scroll, the Second History Scroll, and the Third History Scroll.^When I began my travels in Northrend, I visited the Borean Tundra and met the taunka for the first time. There, Wind Tamer Barah told me the tale of Stormhoof and his battle against the North Wind, their people's ancient enemy. I set out for the Storm Peaks to learn more of this hero, but strangely, the people of Tunka'lo seem to know nothing of him. Perhaps the camp's own records will give us greater insight. Find and read the history scrolls kept throughout the camp, then tell me what you learned.Loken's Lackeys^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^^^The Reckoning^Thorim wants you to slay Eisenfaust inside the Hall of the Shaper and Halefnir the Windborn and Duronn the Runeforged in the Terrace of the Makers.^The attack on the Terrace of the Makers was not a half-hearted move on my brother's behalf. He sent a legion of iron dwarves and some of his most powerful lieutenants. Use the Horn of the Peaks to call the earthen to your side and defeat Loken's servants. You'll find the giant, Eisenfaust, inside the Hall of the Shaper to the north. You'll find the others deeper inside the Terrace of the Makers, beyond the stairs to the northwest.Honor Above All Else^78^All^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Crusade Commander Entari^Honor Above All Else^^Defending The Vanguard, Curing The Incurable^Report to Crusade Commander Entari at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.^Long has been the path to our salvation, young <class>. We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the Lich King and his Scourge. Alas, we fight this battle divided. The Horde and Alliance are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise? Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, <class>! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post.Memories of Stormhoof^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Xarantaur^Xarantaur^^^^Speak with Chieftain Swiftspear in Frostfloe Deep, then return to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.^When the bronze dragonflight gifted me with immortality and set me on the path of the witness, Nozdormu entrusted me with the Lorehammer. The hammer's reaction to your findings means that time has gone awry here and it is our duty to restore the true timeline. We must find it. To the northwest is Frostfloe Deep, ancient burial cave of the warriors of Tunka'lo. Seek out the spirit of Chieftain Swiftspear, Stormhoof's brother. Ask him what he remembers of his brother's battle against the North Wind.Distortions in Time^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Chieftain Swiftspear^Xarantaur^^^^Use the Chieftain's Totem to close 4 Frostfloe Rifts, then bring the totem to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.^This, the tomb of Tunka'lo's warriors, is supposed to be a serene place, free from the terror of the elements. Frostfloe Deep has been invaded by a strange force, one that disturbs the spirits of the fallen and blurs my memories of my own life. It's as though our deeds and memories are being erased from history. In life, this totem was a symbol of my authority. It is the last true link I have to this world. Take it, use it to restore calm to the tomb, and then return it to Camp Tunka'lo.Defending The Vanguard^78^All^Icecrown^Crusader Lord Dalfors^Crusader Lord Dalfors^^Honor Above All Else^If There Are Survivors...^Crusader Lord Dalfors at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown has asked that you kill 15 Forgotten Depths Nerubians.^We can't keep this pace up, <lad/lass>. Once the breach was blown, the floodgates opened up. The Scourge have been pourin' through ever since with no end in sight! We need every able bodied man and woman to help keep the tide of evil at bay. Get out there and do yer share, friend. Kill as many of those monsters as ye can!Curing The Incurable^78^All^Icecrown^Father Gustav^Father Gustav^^Honor Above All Else^If There Are Survivors...^Father Gustav at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown has asked that you bring him 10 Forgotten Depths Venom Sacs.^The number of injured soldiers rises with each passing day. They are being stricken by some type of toxin that we have never before seen. Whatever it is that these Nerubians hold within their venom glands is lethal and incurable! So far we've only been able to slow down the poison flowing through the victim's bodies. We must devise a cure! Venture northwest to the valley outside of the Vanguard and slay the Forgotten Depths Nerubians. Recover their venom glands and bring them to me.Finish the Shipment^65^All^Jewelcrafting^Timothy Jones^Timothy Jones^^^Shipment: Blood Jade Amulet, Shipment: Glowing Ivory Figurine, Shipment: Wicked Sun Brooch, Shipment: Intricate Bone Figurine, Shipment: Bright Armor Relic, Shipment: Shifting Sun Curio^Bring a Chalcedony to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^I'm glad you showed up! A shipment of Glowing Ivory Figurines needs to go out to Undermine right now, and I am still short a Chalcedony to complete an eye for the last one. Bring me one and a Dalaran Jeweler's token will be yours.Deep in the Bowels of The Underhalls^80^All^Icecrown^The Bone Witch^The Bone Witch^^The Bone Witch^^The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village has asked you to beat information out of Apprentice Osterkilgr concerning what Dr. Terrible is truly up to.^Deep in the bowels of The Underhalls to the northeast, a mad scientist known as Dr. Terrible is up to something befitting his name. The doctor has been given dispensation by the Lich King to perform experiments upon the vargul -- the vrykul who fall in battle and are found unworthy, and then turned into Scourge. We must put an end to his work, but my auguries have been unable to find him. He does, however, have an assistant. Beat the information out of his apprentice, and then dispose of the body.The Sum is Greater than the Parts^80^All^Icecrown^Dr. Terrible's "Building a Better Flesh Giant"^The Bone Witch^The Sum is Greater than the Parts^^^Mount and take control of Nergeld. Defend it from the denizens of the Hall of Horrors until Dr. Terrible shows himself.^Opening the tome, you notice all manner of disgusting illustrations concerning the construction of what the doctor refers to as "the ultimate weapon"! Clearly the prototype, Nergeld, is the massive flesh giant standing still at the end of the nearby Hall of Horrors. If an army of those things were to be constructed, then it would mean doom. The only way to ensure that doesn't happen is to slay Dr. Terrible! Perhaps if you were to take control of the construct, the doctor would reveal himself?If There Are Survivors...^78^All^Icecrown^Crusade Commander Entari^Penumbrius^If There Are Survivors...^Scourge Tactics, Defending The Vanguard, Curing The Incurable^Into The Wild Green Yonder^Speak with Penumbrius at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.^Across the Valley of Echoes, west of here, and through the Breach, is the first Scourge encampment in Icecrown known as Scourgeholme. We fought a good fight at Scourgeholme and killed many Scourge, but in the end we were forced to retreat. Many soldiers were left behind - their fate unknown. If there are survivors, we must attempt a rescue. Directly down this southeastern path is Penumbrius, ally of the bronze dragonflight and caretaker of the proto-brood. Seek him out and ask for his assistance.Into The Wild Green Yonder^78^All^Icecrown^Penumbrius^Highlord Tirion Fordring^If There Are Survivors...^^A Cold Front Approaches^Rescue 3 Captured Argent Crusaders from Scourgeholme and drop them off at the Vanguard Infirmary at the center of the Argent Vanguard. Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring should you succeed.^We will do all that we can to assist you, <name>. The proto-brood have volunteered to fly you across the Breach and into Scourgeholme. Rescue any captured Argent Crusaders that you find. Return them immediately to the Vanguard Infirmary, located at the center of this base. Choose one of the Argent Skytalons in the pen behind me and go! Scourgeholme is located northwest, across the Valley of Echoes, through the great Breach.Feeding Arngrim^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Arngrim the Insatiable^Arngrim the Insatiable^^^^You are to feed Arngrim 5 Disembodied Jormungar, then return to Arngrim's frozen image in Dun Niffelem.^Arngrim's hunger was legendary. Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl. It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king. No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand.The Reckoning^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^King Jokkum^The Reckoning^Loken's Lackeys^Diametrically Opposed^Meet Thorim near the Temple of Wisdom. Report the outcome of the fight to King Jokkum in Dun Niffelem.^Loken killed my wife, turned my followers and me against each other. He took away everything I had, but today... that changes. Today we reclaim our sacred grounds. Today... Loken dies. Meet me on the bridge near the Temple of Wisdom, just southwest of Ulduar. I will finish this one way or the other. I need you there as a witness. You will not aid me -- this is personal. After it's done, send word to Jokkum, King of the Frost Giants. He's a good friend and will know what to do.Where Time Went Wrong^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Xarantaur^Xarantaur^^^^Use the Lorehammer on Taunka Relics to attune it to the time of Stormhoof. Once it has been attuned to 6 relics from the time of Stormhoof, return to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.^The Lorehammer can help us correct the damage to the timeline, but only if we can discover where the history was originally corrupted. From Chieftain Swiftspear and your findings at Frostfloe Deep, we know that the change happened around the time of Stormhoof's death. Now, you must go to the Howling Hollow, north of the camp, and inspect the gravesites the North Wind's minions have already destroyed. The Lorehammer will react to artifacts from Stormhoof's era and attune itself to the proper time.The Hero's Arms^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Xarantaur^Xarantaur^^^^Recover Stormhoof's Spear and Stormhoof's Mail and return them to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.^Not all of the camp's records have yet been corrupted. My staff has helped me to find those records which reflect the true timeline. They agree that Stormhoof was given a burial of honor among the village elders on the bottom level of the Howling Hollow, to the north. Most of the graves there have already been destroyed, their contents taken as trophies by the North Wind's subjects. Go to the hollow and see if you can recover Stormhoof's spear and armor from the scions of storm who have claimed them.Veranus^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^Forging an Alliance^^^Thorim, at the Temple of Storms, wants you to obtain 5 Small Proto-Drake Eggs from the peaks near Brunnhildar Village.^If I'm to launch an attack against my brother's army, I'm going to need some way to get around. I released my riding drake back into the wild years ago. Veranus was magnificent. The leader of her own brood -- to whom she has now returned. Finding her will be hard, but perhaps there's a way. She keeps her old empty nest out of pure pride. She's a broodmother in name only, for she is beyond the age of breeding. Bring me small eggs from the other nests near Brunnhildar. I think I've an idea.Territorial Trespass^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^Forging an Alliance^^^Place the Stolen Proto-Dragon Eggs on top of the Broodmother's Nest and return to Thorim at the Temple of Storms.^Veranus is proud like no other beast I've known. She still keeps her old nest and makes sure none of the younger proto-drakes takes it over. Take the eggs you've collected and place them on her nest. You'll find it atop a small peak, directly southeast of here. I should be able to get control of her before she kills you in a fit of rage. Hopefully.The Missing Tracker^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Bloodguard Lorga^Tracker Val'zij^The Missing Tracker^^^Look for Tracker Val'zij inside Gimorak's Den, southeast of the Grom'arsh Crash Site.^I can't in good conscience send you to the worg cave without warning you that the previous person we sent there hasn't returned. We're prepared for the worst, but perhaps there's a chance that he's alive. We'd appreciate it if you helped him return -- Tracker Val'zij is one of the only hunters we have.Cave Medicine^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Tracker Val'zij^Tracker Val'zij^The Missing Tracker^^^Tracker Val'zij, at Gimorak's Den, wants you to obtain 1 Jormungar Toxin Gland and 8 Cave Mushrooms.^It's good to see a friendly face. Might be the last one I see. One of those jormungar stung me with some sort of toxin before I managed to get away. I can feel my whole body getting numb, mon. I'm going to need a toxin gland to make an antidote. I will also need some of the cave mushrooms that grow here... they'll slow the toxin down. Hurry, please. I don't have much time.There's Always Time for Revenge^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Tracker Val'zij^Tracker Val'zij^The Missing Tracker^^^Tracker Val'zij wants you to slay Gimorak inside Gimorak's Den.^I should manage for now, <name>. There is one favor I'd like to ask, though. I would never had fallen to one of these worms, but my wind serpent, Heesha, was killed by the meanest worg I've seen in some time. Don't worry about me now, I'll feel better when that worg is breathing no more. You should find him deeper in the cave.The Terrace of the Makers^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Thorim^Thorim^Forging an Alliance^^^Find Thorim at the southeastern edge of the Terrace of the Makers, just northwest of Dun Niffelem.^It is time, <name>.

When Stormhoof falls and drops the Horn of Elemental Fury, use it to finish off the North Wind, and then return to Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.^At last, we have all that we need to right the wrongs of the North Wind and its followers. You have attuned the Lorehammer to Stormhoof's time and his persona. Take the hammer again, head to the Temple of Life in the plains to the northwest. Use the hammer to assume the role of Stormhoof. Face the North Wind as Stormhoof, but realize that for the timeline to be restored, Stormhoof must die as the North Wind weakens. Then, you must find and use the Horn of Elemental Fury to destroy the North Wind.Revenge for the Vargul^80^All^Icecrown^Bethod Feigr^Bethod Feigr^^^^Bethod Feigr in The Underhalls wants you to throw down his sword to challenge Thane Illskar and then kill him in The Circle of Suffering.^I've been praying to The Lady of the Sword for one to come and strike down my enemy. Thane Illskar must pay for what he did to me! I was the champion of Thane Ufrang the Mighty. During my fight for ascendance in Valhalas, Illskar sabotaged me with dark magic, causing me to lose and be reduced to this. The thane and his champions can be found below in The Circle of Suffering. Challenge him on my behalf. Defeat him. Make him know the suffering that I know!When All Else Fails^78^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Ricket^Olut Alegut^^Demolitionist Extraordinaire^^Speak to Ricket to make use of Ricket's D16 Propelled Delivery Device to enter further into Storm Peaks.^So... so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains. Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty vrykul women, territorial dragon want-to-bes and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening. Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it. <Ricket nods at some nearby rockets.>Prepare for Glory^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Astrid Bjornrittar^Lok'lira the Crone^The Last of Her Kind^^^Speak to Lok'lira the Crone in Brunnhildar Village.^This is it then.

She'll see you on your way.Deemed Worthy^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Brijana^Astrid Bjornrittar^They Took Our Men!^^^Brijana wants you to go to Brunnhildar Village and speak with Astrid Bjornrittar.^You have succeeded where many have failed, sister.

His fire pit will likely be the most obvious indication of his location from the air.^Perhaps you've heard the praises for our missing hero? Crusader Bridenbrad was in the Broken Front aiding the attack against the Scourge when the undead army came down upon them. The many men of that allied force scattered, but Bridenbrad alone returned and dragged more than a dozen men to safety, one by one through the carnage. <class>, he has not returned since. He was spotted heading to the far northeast, towards the Silent Vigil. Bring him back to me that I might honor him for his valor.Shoot 'Em Up^80^All^Icecrown^The Leaper^The Leaper^^^^The Leaper at The Shadow Vault wants you to use a Jotunheim Rapid-Fire Harpoon to shoot down 15 Jotunheim Proto-Drakes and their riders.^Jotunheim has aerial defenses, both in terms of proto-drake riders and harpoon guns.

I carry the plague of undeath, <class>, and I'll not share my fate with those near me. No, I shall stay here. My only regret lies in what I may become when death grips me. I do not fear death itself, but I loathe to consider serving the traitor, Arthas. Leave me... and see to it that no one else comes looking. You would do me a great disservice if you were to expose anyone to the plague that I carry.The Keeper's Favor^80^All^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Keeper Remulos^A Tale of Valor^^^Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle has requested that you secure passage from Arch Druid Lilliandra and speak to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade.^There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light. And Bridenbrad, this is no ordinary man... his valor and devotion shine through. We can only hope that one of these beings will intervene and bring this hero back from a fate worse than death. Go now and speak to Arch Druid Lilliandra in the Argent Vanguard... request passage to Moonglade and seek the aid of Keeper Remulos.Hope Within the Emerald Nightmare^80^All^Icecrown^Keeper Remulos^Keeper Remulos^A Tale of Valor^^^Keeper Remulos at Moonglade has instructed you to enter the emerald dream and recover 3 Emerald Acorns.^What we need exists only in the emerald dream... acorns that are infused with a powerful restorative magic. Many places in this sacred glade are closely tied with the dream, and my shrine is among them. I will send you into the dream to recover some of these acorns. Be prepared though <class>, for this method of entering the dream is dangerous, and it is very likely you will be beset by nightmares. Recover a few acorns quickly, and then depart from my shrine or pinch yourself to return to our world.The Boon of Remulos^80^All^Icecrown^Keeper Remulos^Crusader Bridenbrad^A Tale of Valor^^Time Yet Remains^Return to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown with the Emerald Acorn.^I shall open a portal to take you back to the druid that brought you here.

If nothing else, you've bought me a few more precious hours not plaguing the world as a hideous undead. Thank you, <class>. Please extend my thanks to Tirion as well, and let him know that it has been an honor to serve beside him.The Touch of an Aspect^80^All^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Time Yet Remains^^^Request the aid of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple.^The dragon-queen, Alexstrasza, possesses magics over all life. In the past, she has used great fire to incinerate undead and rebirth fresh new life in their place. Perhaps her powers might be able to save our Bridenbrad as well. Alexstrasza makes her home at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight - please go to her and humbly request her aid on my behalf.Dahlia's Tears^80^All^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Time Yet Remains^^^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder at Wyrmrest Temple has requested that you recover Dahlia's Tears from soil freshly cleansed by a Ruby Keeper's flames.^In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the Light. We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your Bridenbrad... a remnant of a devout being that fell victim to this very same plague. Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my Ruby Dragonshrine where the battle is joined. As my Ruby Keepers fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me.The Boon of Alexstrasza^80^All^Icecrown^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^Crusader Bridenbrad^Time Yet Remains^^Hope Yet Remains^Bring the Breath of Alexstrasza to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown.^You must understand, young <race>, that cleansing the body in favor of life anew is something well within my grasp... removing the plague of undeath without affecting the body, however, is beyond the scope of the powers that I control. If this Bridenbrad is the beacon of light that you profess him to be, perhaps he will endure such a cleansing and thrive, but I cannot state with confidence that this is the salvation that you seek. Take it and go with all of my blessings.Hope Yet Remains^80^All^Icecrown^Crusader Bridenbrad^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Hope Yet Remains^The Boon of Alexstrasza^^Return to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle with news of the effects of the Breath of Alexstrasza.^<Bridenbrad raises a hand to you as he catches his breath.> It was nearly as painful as it looked, but it was as if I could feel some of the corruption being burnt away from within my body. It seems the plague is not so readily bested though. <class>, thank you for everything that you have done. Your selfless actions have renewed my hope that there is yet great good left within this world - I can depart without fear that darkness will prevail in my absence. Go now, go with no regrets.The Will of the Naaru^80^All^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^A'dal^Hope Yet Remains^^^Request the aid of A'dal at Shattrath City in Terokkar Forest.^I appreciate everything that you have done for us, <name>. I have one last errand for you... one last gleaming hope for a paladin who deserves any salvation that we can extend. Go now to Shattrath and speak to the naaru, A'dal. He has long been a beacon of light and powerful ally to devout paladins. Impart Bridenbrad's story and seek any aid that he might have to offer. I cannot impress how important it is that you move quickly - I fear our crusader does not have much more time in this world.The Boon of A'dal^80^All^Icecrown^A'dal^Crusader Bridenbrad^Hope Yet Remains^^Light Within the Darkness^Return to Crusader Bridenbrad at the Silent Vigil in Icecrown.^I am pleased that you have come to me, <name>. I know of Crusader Bridenbrad, and of your travels in hope of saving him. Bridenbrad's valor has sparked remarkable selflessness in you, and this is a miracle unto itself. The Light will take care of its own. I will extend my blessing to Bridenbrad and he shall not endure the corruption of undeath. I shall return you to Dalaran, and you shall return to him. Know that I remain with you.Light Within the Darkness^80^All^Icecrown^Bridenbrad's Possessions^Highlord Tirion Fordring^^The Boon of A'dal^^Bring Crusader Bridenbrad's Tabard to Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle.^<Crusader Bridenbrad's tabard rests in the bottom of the chest, shifting slightly as the howling wind finds its way in.> Tirion will desire this last remnant of the great crusader.Vandalizing Jotunheim^80^All^Icecrown^Duke Lankral^Duke Lankral^^^Leave Our Mark, Vaelen Has Returned^Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault wants you to burn 10 Vrykul Banners.^Let us see if we can further weaken the resolve of the vrykul, <name>. Each day I wish you to travel to Jotunheim and put their banners to the torch. It may seem a trivial thing, but to see their ancestral home vandalized on a daily basis will demoralize them more than any physical punishment you can inflict. At least... it can't hurt.Vaelen Has Returned^80^All^Icecrown^Baron Sliver^Vaelen the Flayed^Vaelen Has Returned^Crush Dem Vrykuls!, Vandalizing Jotunheim^^Speak with Vaelen the Flayed at The Shadow Vault.^I just saw that incompetent fool, Vaelen the Flayed, sneak into the vault building.

You must also kill 3 Frostbrood Destroyers.^I've triggered the base's defenses, <class>! Atop each of the Vanguard's four towers is a retractable Argent Crusade cannon, blessed by Father Gustav himself. You'll need to fly up to one of those towers and man a cannon.

Da innkeeper in da Dalaran sewers needs a vegetable stew as his customers dey don't have so much to eat, mon. He asked for a vegetable stew as he didn't appreciate da gnome that was in the last stew I sent.

Yet, that is not enough. More and more skeletal constructors keep appearing to increase the pace of work. If we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons.The Purging Of Scourgeholme^78^All^Icecrown^The Ebon Watcher^The Ebon Watcher^^^The Air Stands Still^The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to kill 3 Forgotten Depths High Priests, 3 Forgotten Depths Underkings, and 8 Reanimated Crusaders.^The Scourge have sent their armies at the Argent Crusade and have been repelled. What they do now is called a 'slash and burn.' All prisoners that they hold at Scourgeholme will be executed and raised as servants of the Lich King. Undoubtedly the Argent Crusade will request that you give their soldiers a proper farewell. I'll ask no such thing of you. To succeed we must kill Scourge indiscriminately. Venture to Scourgeholme, northwest through the Breach, and lay waste to all that stand in your way.Destroying the Altars^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^^Where Are They Coming From?^Spill Their Blood^Kill Master Summoner Zarod and use his Summoning Stave to destroy the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Summoning Altars. When you've completed this task, report to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.^So they're summoning in their workers and warriors at those altars? They'll need to be the first thing to go. The master summoner should have a staff which allows him to activate the portal. If you kill the master summoner and take the staff, you can use it to overload the summoning portal and destroy its altar. Do this at all four of the altars and return to me once they've been destroyed.Death's Gaze^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^^Where Are They Coming From?^Spill Their Blood^Use the Death's Gaze Orb to place orbs on the Abomination Lab Orb Stand, the Flesh Giant Lab Orb Stand, and the Cauldron Area Orb Stand, then return to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.^The Fleshwerks is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan. <Arly produces an orb from the folds of her cloak and shows it to you.> This is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the Scourge's actions and decide how best to strike. Place these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas -- the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west.Through the Eye^80^All^Icecrown^The Bone Witch^The Bone Witch^The Sum is Greater than the Parts^^^The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village has tasked you with using the Eye of the Lich King to gain information.^We must use the Lich King's tools against him if we are to decide our next step. Over the mountain to the southwest lies Kul'galar Keep. Within it reside the oracles of Jotunheim who receive orders from their master and scry upon others through the Eye of the Lich King. It is the eye that you must fight your way to. While it cannot be used to pierce the veil within Icecrown Citadel, you should be able to use it to discern something of value so that we will know how best to proceed.The Scourgestone^78^All^Icecrown^The Ebon Watcher^The Ebon Watcher^^^The Air Stands Still^The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to bring him 15 Scourgestones.^A Scourgestone is an item given to all Scourge upon birth or creation. It provides certain benefits to the holder, but more importantly it allows Scourge leaders visibility into the location and movement of all of their units. With enough Scourgestones, I might be able to track the movement of other Scourge units across Icecrown. As you slaughter Scourge in Scourgeholme, gather all of the Scourgestones that you find. Return to me when your bags are full.The Struggle Persists^80^All^The Oculus^Raelorasz^Belgaristrasz^The Struggle Persists^^^Raelorasz wants you to enter the Oculus and rescue Belgaristrasz and his companions.^The battle goes on, <name>. Somehow we have managed to avoid detection and continue our attempts to frustrate Malygos' schemes. This, though, is where the good news ends and the bad begins. Our best efforts have had little or no effect. Malygos and his underlings grow stronger in power with each passing day. And now, our latest assault team has been captured and is being held in the Oculus. We must attempt a rescue! Belgaristrasz and his companions are invaluable to our cause. Can we count on you, <name>?The Air Stands Still^79^All^Icecrown^The Ebon Watcher^The Ebon Watcher^^The Purging Of Scourgeholme, The Scourgestone^Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^The Ebon Watcher at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to kill Salranax the Flesh Render, Underking Talonox and High Priest Yath'amon.^You must defeat the lords of Scourgeholme if this place is to be free of the Scourge's grasp. Salranax the Flesh Render lords over the temple on the first tier of Scourgeholme. Nearby Salranax you'll find High Priest Yath'amon preaching at the spirit tower on the second tier. Underking Talonox holds court at the Pit of Fiends, up the high road. These are formidable opponents and must be approached with caution. Use this war horn should you require aid. The death knights of Acherus will come.A Unified Front^80^All^The Oculus^Belgaristrasz^Image of Belgaristrasz^The Struggle Persists^^^Belgaristrasz wants you to destroy 10 Centrifuge Constructs to bring down Varos' shield. You then must defeat Varos Cloudstrider.^Please accept our gratitude, <race>. You and your friends have succeeded where we had failed - you have bested Drakos. From here, however, it will take our combined efforts to proceed. Above us, Varos hides behind an impenetrable shield. To reach him, you must defeat the Centrifuge Constructs that power his shield. That is where my friends and I come in.... We each can provide you with drakes from our respective flights. Only with the help of these drakes will you be able to expose Varos.Mage-Lord Urom^80^All^The Oculus^Image of Belgaristrasz^Image of Belgaristrasz^The Struggle Persists^^^Belgaristrasz wants you to defeat Mage-Lord Urom in the Oculus.^Only one obstacle stands between us and our ultimate goal here, <class>. His name is Urom. Above us, guarding the third ring, he awaits us. Beware his powerful conjurings, friend. He is a frightful opponent, certain to challenge your prowess. Bring him down. Make him pay for his treacherous allegiance to the enemy!A Wing and a Prayer^80^All^The Oculus^Image of Belgaristrasz^Raelorasz^The Struggle Persists^^^Belgaristrasz wants you to kill Eregos in the Oculus and then report to Raelorasz at the Transitus Shield in Coldarra.^The time has come to face Eregos, friend. He is cunning and strong. One of Malygos' most trusted minions, he draws strength from the energies he is charged with defending - sipping from the well of the great aspect himself. This shall not be easy.... However, defeating the Mage-Lord has allowed us to unlock the full power of our drakes. Their skills shall be at your command. Use them wisely and Eregos shall surely fall. Should you succeed, return to Raelorasz and inform him of our victory.Head Games^74^All^Drak'Tharon Keep^Kurzel^Mack Fearsen^Seared Scourge^^^Kurzel wants you to use Kurzel's Blouse Scrap at the corpse of Novos the Summoner, then take the Ichor-Stained Cloth to Mack.^Too lazy for their own good.... Wait! I know how to teach 'em! <Kurzel rips a long strip of material from her blouse and hands it to you.> Here, <race>, take this. Dip it in the remains of that annoying lich over there and return it to Mack back at the camp. Once the boys have stewed in their guilt for a while I'll show up and let them off the hook. They'll learn not to let a lady wander off alone!The Stone That Started A Revolution^79^All^Icecrown^Crusade Architect Silas^Crusade Architect Silas^^^Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^Crusade Architect Silas at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to retrieve 10 Trunks of Crystalline Heartwood and 10 pieces of Ancient Elven Masonry.^You may look at Scourgeholme now and see a rancid pit of decay, but one day it will be a place of glory and honor. Highlord Fordring has deemed it "Justice Keep." Alas, even an impregnable fortress like Icecrown Citadel began with but a single stone. So begins our search for the stone to start a revolution. Travel to Crystalsong, south of here, and seek out the Unbound Thicket in the east. Once there gather crystalline heartwood from the thicket floor and elven masonry from the Ruins of Shandaral.Junk in My Trunk^80^All^Utgarde Pinnacle^Brigg Smallshanks^Brigg Smallshanks^^^^Brigg in Utgarde Pinnacle wants you to find 5 Untarnished Silver Bars, 3 Shiny Baubles, 2 Golden Goblets, and a Jade Statue.^Just look at it! Me trunk never been so empty. Shoulda been filled ten times over by now! Me mates jumped at the sight o' all that booty, and now look at 'em! Rattlin' bones, they be! It be like me mammy use 'ta tell me - only thing worse than no treasure be cursed treasure. Say, thar be plenty o' loot farther in, an' not the cursed kind I'll wager. These sots not be needin' it - it just be junk ta them. Fetch it fer me an' I'll be rewardin' ya handsomely, matey.Vengeance Be Mine!^80^All^Utgarde Pinnacle^Brigg Smallshanks^Brigg Smallshanks^^^^Brigg in Utgarde Pinnacle wants you to kill King Ymiron.^Och! They cannae be blamed, <lad/lass>. Who'da done different? They hurled themselves at them piles o' gold - thought they'd hit the mother lode, they did. Aye... But look at 'em now. Mindless servants unable to pick up a single doubloon. Only luck spared me from the same fate. In the scurry I got knocked down - was a wee bit tipsy to begin with. Looked up ta see the first of 'em turn... Be a good <lad/lass> and find the one in charge here and teach 'em not ta be cursin' me mates.Find the Ancient Hero^80^All^Icecrown^The Bone Witch^The Bone Witch^The Sum is Greater than the Parts^^^The Bone Witch at Njorndar Village wants you to return with Iskalder.^Quickly, <name>, head southwest to the Halls of the Ancestors! Within you will find slumbering mjordin. Wake them until you find Iskalder. When you do, use this amulet upon him and bring him back to me. Now go. There is no time to waste!Spill Their Blood^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^^Destroying the Altars, Death's Gaze^Jagged Shards^Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch wants you to destroy 5 vats of Embalming Fluid and 5 Blood Orbs.^The Scourge cannot create their flesh monsters without blood and embalming fluid to preserve the parts and keep them functioning. If we can deny them these materials, their army will fall apart and we can easily destroy their creations. Throughout the labs where the flesh giants and abominations are cobbled together, you will find vats of embalming fluid and large orbs filled with blood. Destroy these, and bring death to any who would stop you!It Could Kill Us All^79^All^Icecrown^Crusade Engineer Spitzpatrick^Crusade Engineer Spitzpatrick^^^Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^Crusade Engineer Spitzpatrick at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown wants you to retrieve 8 pieces of Crystallized Energy.^Southeast of here, at the eastern reaches of Crystalsong Forest, is an area known as the Unbound Thicket. Within that thicket creeps all manner of life. One thing all of the affected creatures of the thicket share in common is their affinity for magical energy. Each of them holds pure, crystallized energy. Enough to kill us all should it ever destabilize! Travel to the Unbound Thicket and kill its denizens for crystallized energy. We need fuel and they need to die. We call that a "win-win."Jagged Shards^80^All^Icecrown^Jagged Shard^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^^Spill Their Blood^^Bring 10 Jagged Shards to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch.^You pulled this jagged, dark brittle shard from the body of a ghoul. The metal blade lacks a smooth edge, suggesting it was forged by an unskilled hand, or was broken from a larger piece. You recall seeing similar shards embedded in the bodies of all the ghouls you've encountered at the Fleshwerks, leading you to wonder why their creators bothered to include the metal at all. Perhaps Crusader Olakin Sainrith would have some insight if you brought him the shards from several ghouls.Not-So-Honorable Combat^80^All^Icecrown^The Bone Witch^The Bone Witch^The Sum is Greater than the Parts^^^The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village wants you to defeat Iskalder upon Battlescar Spire.^Atop the tallest peak to the southwest overlooking Jotunheim is Battlescar Spire. It is a place of reverence for the vrykul, second only to Valhalas in terms of where they prefer to do honorable combat. We shall visit not-so-honorable combat upon it. Gather your companions and fly to the spire. When you are ready, light the signal fire and I will appear within the body of Iskalder. We will fight, you will win, and Vardmadra is sure to come to witness the battle!I'm Smelting... Smelting!^80^All^Icecrown^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^^^^Use the Bag of Jagged Shards near one of the bottom level Malykriss furnaces. Return to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch with the Smelted Metal Bar.^<Olakin turns one of the shards over in an armored fist.> These could pierce armor with enough force. We have to find out what they're made of and what the Lich King intends to do with them. To the east, nestled next to Icecrown Citadel itself, lies Malykriss. From the few reports we have, it's full of smelting and smithing equipment. Bring these shards there, and smelt them in one of the open furnaces on the bottom level of Malykriss. Once the metal has been reformed, we can identify it.Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^79^All^Icecrown^Father Gustav^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^The Restless Dead, The Air Stands Still, The Stone That Started A Revolution, It Could Kill Us All^The Battle For Crusaders' Pinnacle^Deliver Father Gustav's Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.^Silas and Spitzpatrick have signed off on the materials and fuel needed to begin construction of Justice Keep. Thanks to you and the Ebon Blade the Scourge presence within Scourgeholme has been decimated and their lieutenants have been defeated. I have chosen the site at which we will break ground, but first you must deliver my report to Highlord Tirion Fordring. We will begin our march into Icecrown on his command.The Runesmiths of Malykriss^80^All^Icecrown^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^^^^Bring 5 Runed Saronite Plates to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch.^Those shards you recovered can only have come from one place, Malykriss. It's the seat of the Lich King's metalworking operations, to the east of Corp'rethar. What's puzzling is that metal isn't needed to stitch together abominations or flesh giants, or to summon skeletal servants. Find the skeletal runesmiths working on the bottom level of Malykriss and capture the plates they're working on. We need to find out why this metal is finding its way to the Fleshwerks.The Battle For Crusaders' Pinnacle^79^All^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Father Gustav^Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^^The Crusaders' Pinnacle^Venture to Crusaders' Pinnacle and use the Blessed Banner of the Crusade atop the Pile of Crusader Skulls. Defend the banner against Scourge attack until the land atop the pinnacle is sanctified and then return to Father Gustav at the Valley of Echoes in Icecrown.^<Highlord Fordring holds a banner of the Argent Crusade.> This banner is like no other, <name>. It carries with it a powerful blessing, able to sanctify large tracts of blighted land. You must take it northwest, through the Breach, to an area the Scourge have mockingly named Crusaders' Pinnacle. Plant the banner atop the skulls of our fallen brethren at Crusaders' Pinnacle and defend it against attack. Once the land is sanctified, return to Father Gustav. Go now, <name>. Hold no fear in your heart.Banshee's Revenge^80^All^Icecrown^The Bone Witch^The Bone Witch^The Sum is Greater than the Parts^^^The Bone Witch at Njorndar Village has asked you to exact her revenge by challenging and defeating Overthane Balargarde.^The time has come, <name>. You and your friends must challenge the lord of Balargarde Fortress, the master of Jotunheim, Overthane Balargarde. Atop the fortress, which is on the southwestern edge of Jotunheim, you will find a horn. Blow into it. Allow your challenge to resound throughout the steadfast. Balargarde will have no choice but to face you. And I... excuse me, Vardmadra will be there to adjudicate the challenge. <The banshee-possessed vrykul lets out a bellowing cackle.>New Recruit^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^^Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering has requested that you bring a subdued Lithe Stalker to the top of the rocks northeast of the Rise of Suffering.^First things first. I saw some Lithe Stalkers on the ramparts just east of us. They used to serve us before we broke with Arthas, and they're about as perfect a scout as you can get... with a little prodding from an eye of dominion. Fly up, find one of the stalkers, beat it down a bit, and then use this Sigil of the Ebon Blade to command its obedience. It will recognize the sigil, guaranteed. Lead it back to the top of the rocks northeast of here and it will find its way to me.Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^^A Visit to the Doctor, By Fire Be Purged^He's Gone to Pieces, Let's Get Out of Here!, Let's Get Out of Here^Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch wants you to destroy 3 Chained Abominations with Burning Skeletons.^The workers in the Fleshwerks abomination lab have already completed a number of their creations. For now, the creatures are chained to the pillars around the edge of the lab, but if we do not act, they will march with the Lich King's armies. Grasping arms reach out of the bone piles spread throughout the Fleshwerks. These arms belong to skeletons enchanted with the power of fire. Find and free these skeletons, then take them near the completed abominations and watch the show!The Vile Hold^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^Generosity Abounds, Matchmaker, Stunning View^Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering has requested that you use a Lithe Stalker to scout out Malykriss.^We need to know what we're up against. Use the eye of dominion to assume control of a lithe stalker and scout out the area. There are a few spots in particular I saw when flying in that I want you to get a closer look at: the overlook in the northeast, the work area in the southeast, the large forge near the center, and the ritual area in the southwest. The stalker can leap far and won't be hurt by large falls - use that to your advantage to get up and down from those ramparts.Generosity Abounds^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^The Vile Hold^^Vereth the Cunning wants you to use the Lithe Stalker's Iron Chain to drag Scourge Bombs to 4 Lumbering Atrocities inside Malykriss.^We need to cause some disruption... anything to bring those death knights away from their leaders. If we lay waste to their minions below, I suspect they'll have to devote more attention to keeping a close eye on operations. Abominations are easy prey - slow, predictable, and most importantly, stupid. Take advantage of their trust of the stalkers to drag them some of the Scourge bombs scattered throughout the construction area. You'll be able light the bombs far before they figure out what's going on.Matchmaker^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^The Vile Hold^^Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker to throw rocks at Umbral Brutes as they near lesser undead in Malykriss. Return after you've started 5 fights.^The major difference between vargul and lesser undead minions is that vargul still possess enough of their minds to despise being used for labor. Never will a vargul be pleased to be working aside skeletons or ghouls. Lets take advantage of this inevitable animosity and start some fights between the umbral brutes and the other undead in Malykriss. That should serve to slow production and bring the death knights down to babysit. Should be simple - throw rocks at the brutes as they near lesser undead.Necklace Repair^77^All^Jewelcrafting^Damaged Necklace^Timothy Jones^^^^Repair the necklace with a single Chalcedony and return it to Timothy Jones in at the Jewelcrafters Shop in the Magus Commerce Exchange in Dalaran.^This damaged necklace has an invoice with it that reads "Property of Timothy Jones - Cartier and Co Fine Jewelry - Magus Commerce Exhange - Dalaran". Perhaps you should repair it and return it to him.Dispelling Illusions^80^All^The Culling of Stratholme^Chromie^Chromie^Dispelling Illusions^^^Chromie wants you to use the Arcane Disruptor on the suspicious crates in Stratholme Past, then speak to her near the entrance to Stratholme.^Always meddling... The Infinite Dragonflight seek to disrupt history as we have come to know it by deceiving Prince Arthas. If they can convince him that none of the grain here carries the plague, then he'll never have to make the fateful decision to cull Stratholme. This must not come to pass. Use this Arcane Disruptor on any suspicious crates of grain you find to reveal them for what they are. Meet me near Stratholme's entrance, north of this place, when the work is done.A Royal Escort^80^All^The Culling of Stratholme^Chromie^Chromie^Dispelling Illusions^^^Chromie has asked you to accompany Arthas in the Culling of Stratholme. You are to speak with her again after Mal'Ganis is defeated.^The Infinite Dragonflight are not likely to give up so easily. I cannot be certain of what they're up to, but something tells me we haven't seen the last of them today. In just a moment, Arthas will face a desperate dilemma, and make a momentous decision. Don't lose focus now, <name>. I needn't remind you how much is at stake. I must call upon you to accompany the prince in his culling of Stratholme. Arthas must make it through Stratholme alive and you must see to it that he defeats Mal'Ganis!A Visit to the Doctor^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^^^Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton^Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch wants you to destroy the Metal Stake imprisoning Patches in the Sanctum of Reanimation and help him get his revenge on Doctor Sabnok.^So they've been embedding these ghouls with broken shards of saronite down in the Sanctum of Reanimation? We must put a stop to this, before these ghouls can be deployed against our troops. Find the entrance to the Sanctum of Reanimation in the flesh giant lab area of the Fleshwerks. There, the ghoul mastermind, Doctor Sabnok, keeps the most fearsome of his creations, Patches. Free Patches from his chains and help him take his revenge on the doctor. Let his own creation be his undoing.Warding the Warriors^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Sorceress Kaylana^Sorceress Kaylana^^^^Sorceress Kaylana at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 sets of Imbued Horde Armor from Horde players at the Glacial Falls.^<name>, good to see you. While the battle has subsided for now, we must hurry and replenish our stocks. My research indicates that the armor of soldiers recently slain in the Glacial Falls becomes imbued with an incredible amount of energy. The Horde has been seen collecting armor in the area. Head to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me. If you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.Bones and Arrows^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Bowyer Randolph^Bowyer Randolph^^^^Bowyer Randolph at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Quivers of Dragonbone Arrows from Horde players at the Forest of Shadows.^Dragons are incredible! Well, their bones at least! I've been equipping our archers with arrowheads made of Dragonbone. Unfortunately, since the massacre at Angrathar, it has become almost impossible to get bone from Dragonblight. However, the Forest of Shadows on the western edge of Wintergrasp has enough bones to tide us over. Head to the Forest of Shadows and bring back any bone splinters you can find! The Horde have been seen collecting bone splinters in the area. Slay them!Vereth the Cunning^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^Seeds of Chaos, Amidst the Confusion^^Report to Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering in Icecrown.^I've already heard some rumors regarding Malykriss and Arthas's new death knight order, but I assumed it nothing more than filling the void. These numbers suggest he's trying to take it up a notch though. We dispatched one of our best to Malykriss not long ago - Vereth the Cunning. You should be able to find him on the Rise of Suffering, just west of Malykriss, and inside the Court of Bones. Try not to draw too much attention on your way in.A Rare Herb^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Anchorite Tessa^Anchorite Tessa^^^^Anchorite Tessa in Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Horde Herb Pouches from Horde players in the Steppe of Life.^My, it its quite chilly up here! Reminds me of the stormy peaks of Kaarinos on Argus. However, with all of this snow and ice, our soldiers can easily catch cold. Head to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp, and bring me back 10 of the Horde herb pouches you find. I will grind them into a medicine to help protect against the cold. The Horde have been seen collecting them from the plant life in the area. Do not hesitate to slay them and retrieve the herbs!The Crusaders' Pinnacle^79^All^Icecrown^Father Gustav^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend^^^Seek out Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle in Icecrown.^Stand proud in knowing that it was you who helped establish the Argent Crusade inside the walls of Icecrown, <name>. The Crusaders' Pinnacle now stands in direct defiance of the Lich King and his twisted minions. Highlord Fordring and the crusaders who survived await your arrival at Crusaders' Pinnacle. Travel once more through the Breach and seek out the highlord!Discretion is Key^77^All^The Violet Hold^Rhonin^Warden Alturas^Discretion is Key^^^Rhonin wants you to go to the Violet Hold in Dalaran and speak with Warden Alturas.^Listen to me, <race>. It's just been brought to my attention that there's been an incident at the Violet Hold. It would appear that the blues are launching a full scale invasion of Dalaran! I need you to get to the prison and speak with Warden Alturas at once. He'll give you the details. That is not all. I need this handled with utmost discretion. We mustn't alarm the citizens of Dalaran if it can possibly be avoided. Do I make myself clear? Very well. Now, go!Containment^77^All^The Violet Hold^Warden Alturas^Warden Alturas^Discretion is Key^^^Warden Alturas wants you to enter the Violet Hold and put and end to the blue dragon invasion force. You are to report back to him once Cyanigosa is slain.^Here is the prison key. My men and I will stay here as a last line of defense in the event that you are unable to overcome the assault. Be sure to speak with Lieutenant Sinclari. She'll provide you with access to the prison's defenses. Hurry, <race>. There is little time. The few I left inside won't last long without your help. Report back to me once the invasion forces have been successfully dealt with.Stunning View^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^The Vile Hold^^Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker's heave ability to destroy 12 sleeping Iceskin Sentries.^Gargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air. As I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep.The Rider of the Unholy^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^^The Fate of Bloodbane^Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Rokir, the Rider of the Unholy.^It's time that we start cutting off the heads of the beast. I served beside Rokir for quite some time. He knows the unholy arts better than most any other death knight I've met and he's equally as ruthless. Rokir's strengths are most apparent when you are fighting him on his own ground. Sadly, we don't have much option in those regards, but stay on your feet to avoid his undead minions and you should come out victorious. Be nimble, <class>, and do not take him lightly.The Rider of Frost^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^^The Fate of Bloodbane^Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Sapph, the Rider of Frost.^Sapph... Sapph's a death knight like no other. She'll shower you with sweet words and you'll swear that she has no evil within her heart, and then she'll run you through without even breaking her smile. I have no fear that you'll be able to best Sapph, but do not grow overconfident. Her strength lies in lulling her victims into a false ease, shortly before shattering them with a fierce barrage of frost attacks. Do not let your guard down, and do not underestimate her.The Rider of Blood^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^^The Fate of Bloodbane^Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Baelok, the Rider of Blood.^Baelok is one of the few vrykul that I've ever seen rise through the ranks, and that was mostly accomplished through sheer brutality. If your competition ends up dead, there's far less to compete against. When you join battle with him, spread out from your companions and keep your distance as much as you reasonably can. He will not hesitate to steal your life force for himself, so you will need to hinder his ability to do so as much as possible. You have my confidence. See to it that he dies.The Fate of Bloodbane^80^All^Icecrown^Vereth the Cunning^Vereth the Cunning^^The Rider of the Unholy, The Rider of Frost, The Rider of Blood^^Vereth on the Rise of Suffering has dispatched you to kill Orbaz Bloodbane.^With the riders of the Host of Suffering dead, now is the time to put an end to their true leader: Orbaz Bloodbane. Mograine caught up with me while you were off and told me that he found where Orbaz is hiding. Under Icecrown Citadel itself, there is an immense pit - you will find Orbaz just outside its lip. Some of the Ebon Blade's strongest agents have already been dispatched - gather aid and join the fight. It is time for Bloodbane to die.Taking Back Acherus^55^All^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^Highlord Darion Mograine^The Light of Dawn^^^Use your Death Gate spell to return to Acherus: The Ebon Hold. Report to Highlord Darion Mograine once you arrive.^The haze has been lifted. I can see as clearly now as the day that I plunged the Ashbringer into my own heart to free my father's cursed soul: my last memory as a free man. We must take back Acherus from the Scourge if our order is to survive in this new world. I have taught you how to call forth a death gate. The death gate will return you to Acherus when you call upon it, <name>. Use it now and meet me at Acherus. The first battle of the Knights of the Ebon Blade is underway! Death to the Scourge!The Battle For The Ebon Hold^55^All^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^Highlord Darion Mograine^The Light of Dawn^^Where Kings Walk, Warchief's Blessing^Slay 10 Scourge and help kill Patchwerk. Return to Highlord Darion Mograine should you succeed.^The Hall of Command has been secured, but the Lich King has left us a little present in the Heart of Acherus. The stitched terror, Patchwerk, and a horde of abominations have taken over the second floor. Use the teleporter to get to the second floor and destroy the Scourge forces that remain. Do not engage Patchwerk alone! You must fight the monstrosity with other death knights of Acherus! Go, <name>. You have my strength to carry you!Death to the Traitor King^74^All^Dragonblight^Kilix the Unraveler^Kilix the Unraveler^^^^Kilix the Unraveler in the Pit of Narjun has tasked you with defeating Anub'arak in Azjol-Nerub. You are to return to Kilix with Anub'arak's Broken Husk.^Anub'arak, the traitor king, makes his home in the once proud underland of Azjol-Nerub. Since his betrayal, he has twisted and perverted our homeland into the wretched squalor it is today. He rules over an army of undead nerubians who, like their leader, have pledged themselves to serving the Lich King. Bring an end to the traitor king's reign, <class>. You will be doing a great service to both of our peoples. If you manage to succeed where all others have failed, bring me the husk of Anub'arak.Parting Gifts^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Keritose Bloodblade^^^^Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault wants you to use an Eye of Dominion to take control of a captured Eidolon Watcher.^Look what we have here... eyes of dominion. The Cult normally goes to great lengths to keep these things safe, but I suppose their options for retreat are few when we're slaughtering them in their own home. The eyes allow a being of any relative power to control an undead minion's actions precisely. As you can imagine, this can be extremely useful when it comes to your typical clumsy ghoul or skeleton. Care to try your hand at it? Use one of the eyes to control a captured shade.An Undead's Best Friend^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Keritose Bloodblade^^^^Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault wants you to use the Eidolon Watcher to feed 18 Hungering Plaguehounds.^As is usual practice, the undead at the saronite quarry to the southwest starve plaguehounds to keep them extra aggressive. Use the shade to get up close and feed some of those hounds and I promise you they'll be content to leave you alone, if not side with the hand that fed them. Don't get too close to those things until you've fed them though. Their noses don't fall victim to your shade's elusiveness.Honor is for the Weak^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Keritose Bloodblade^^^^Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault would like you to assassinate 20 Restless Lookouts.^Ghouls are fragile things when it comes down to it, and the lookouts at the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest are no exception. Using one of the shades, I have no doubt that you can sneak up and put down their lookouts without making a sound. Clear out as many lookouts as you can reach in a reasonable amount of time... we'll want their ranks thinned for our assault to come.From Whence They Came^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Keritose Bloodblade^^^^Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has sent you to banish 10 Scourge Containment Crystals.^My main concern is the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest. They are pulling up immense amounts of ore from that quarry and I'd like to know what they're building with it. To that end, we'll start by weakening their defenses. I noticed a series of crystals scattered throughout the base and I assume they are defensive structures of some sort, not unlike ziggurats. Use the eidolon watcher to destroy any of those crystals that you find.Seeds of Chaos^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Keritose Bloodblade^^^Vereth the Cunning^Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has dispatched you to slaughter 80 undead in the Weeping Quarry. Speak to him to secure a skeletal gryphon for the assault.^Effective tool, is it not? Excellent job weakening their defenses, <class>. Now we can push the main assault. The plan here is straight-foward - we're looking to destroy anything moving, and get in there and steal some information amidst the confusion. Let me know when you're ready and I'll set you up with a skeletal gryphon.Amidst the Confusion^80^All^Icecrown^Keritose Bloodblade^Keritose Bloodblade^^^Vereth the Cunning^Keritose Bloodblade at the Shadow Vault has requested a Weeping Quarry Document, a Weeping Quarry Ledger, a Weeping Quarry Map, and a Weeping Quarry Schedule.^Shutting down their operation is just half of the plan. The other important goal here is to find out where all that saronite is being sent. We know of a few places it's been ending up, but the amount they're pulling out suggests to me that there's a bigger project in the works. Once you're inside the quarry, get your hands on any of their documents that you can find. If you're assaulting the place with one of the gryphons, you can drop down from it as soon as the wetwork is done.No Mercy for the Merciless^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Commander Zanneth^Commander Zanneth^^^^Commander Zanneth in Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to slay 10 members of the Horde.^Welcome to the Wintergrasp Fortress, <name>. Your mission is simple. Defeat ten of the Horde's finest. Now, go! Bring victory to the Alliance!Slay them all!^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Commander Dardosh^Commander Dardosh^^^^Commander Dardosh in Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to slay 10 members of the Alliance.^Welcome to the Wintergrasp Fortress, <name>. Warlord Garrosh demands one thing: Slay them all! Return to me when ten of the strongest members of the Alliance are dead.No Mercy for the Merciless^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Commander Zanneth^Commander Zanneth^^^^Commander Zanneth in Wintergrasp wants you to slay 10 members of the Horde.^Welcome to the Wintergrasp, <name>. Your mission is simple. Defeat ten of the Horde's finest. Now, go! Bring victory to the Alliance!Slay them all!^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Commander Dardosh^Commander Dardosh^^^^Commander Dardosh in Wintergrasp wants you to slay 10 members of the Alliance.^Welcome to the Wintergrasp, <name>. Warlord Garrosh demands one thing: Slay them all! Return to me when ten of the strongest members of the Alliance are dead.Victory in Wintergrasp^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Tactical Officer Ahbramis^Tactical Officer Ahbramis^^^^Win a Wintergrasp battleground match and return to Tactical Officer Abrahmis in Wintergrasp. You must have participated in the battle to be credited for the victory.^Commander Zanneth might be satisfied with a pile of Horde corpses at his feet, but controlling Wintergrasp is of the utmost importance to the Valiance Expedition. Make sure it remains in our control. However, don't think we'll just let you stand around while your allies do your dirty work for you. If you're not at least a second level recruit by the end of the battle, don't come back.Don't Forget the Eggs!^74^All^Dragonblight^Kilix the Unraveler^Kilix the Unraveler^^^^Kilix the Unraveler in the Pit of Narjun wants you to enter Azjol-Nerub and destroy 6 Nerubian Scourge Eggs.^Throughout Azjol-Nerub, the scourged nerubians carefully nurture eggs that will soon hatch, providing them even greater numbers. It would do little good for the caverns to be cleansed of the undead that stain them if these fouled eggs were left to hatch and take their place. As you explore the expanse that was once Azjol-Nerub, be sure to clear our ancient home of any scourge eggs you find.Victory in Wintergrasp^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Tactical Officer Kilrath^Tactical Officer Kilrath^^^^Win a Wintergrasp battleground match and return to Tactical Officer Kilrath in Wintergrasp. You must have participated in the battle to gain credit for the victory.^While Dardosh might be content with slaying our foes, it is of the utmost importance that we control Wintergrasp Fortress. Do whatever it takes to ensure Wintergrasp is ours. However, don't think we'll just let you stand around while your allies do your dirty work for you. If you're not at least a second level recruit by the end of the battle, don't come back.Stop the Siege^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Lieutenant Murp^Lieutenant Murp^^^^Lieutenant Murp in Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to destroy 3 Alliance siege machines.^I hears dem! The Alliance come soon. Destroy three Alliance siege devices and come back to Murp.Stop the Siege^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Senior Demolitionist Legoso^Senior Demolitionist Legoso^^^^Senior Demolitionist Legoso in Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to destroy 3 Horde siege machines.^It is only a matter of time before this castle is besieged by the forces of the Horde. Destroy three of their siege devices and return to me.The Faceless Ones^76^All^Ahn'kahet: The Old Kingdom^Kilix the Unraveler^Kilix the Unraveler^^^^Kilix the Unraveler in the Pit of Narjun wants you to kill Herald Volazj and the three Forgotten Ones that accompany him in Ahn'Kahet.^In my peoples' struggle against the forces of the undead, they dug deeper as they lost ground. In desperation, they dug too deep. We inadvertently exposed a tendril of the old god's will, which was made manifest in the creatures known only as the Faceless. In the end, we could not fight on two fronts against such powerful enemies. Our misfortune cost us the war against the undead, and ultimately, our home. Enter Ahn'kahet, <class>, and cleanse our former home of these Faceless atrocities.Where Kings Walk^55^Alliance^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^King Varian Wrynn^^The Battle For The Ebon Hold^^Deliver the letter to King Varian Wrynn of the Alliance at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind City.^You are now, and forever will be, a Knight of the Ebon Blade, <name>, but know this: you were once a hero of the Alliance. <Darion stares at you.> This order must establish allies for itself if it is to survive. You must represent the Knights of the Ebon Blade to the Alliance. On the platform, southeast of me, is a portal to Stormwind City. Take this letter, given to me on your behalf by Lord Fordring, and deliver it to King Varian Wrynn. Use the portal.Warchief's Blessing^55^Horde^Death Knight^Highlord Darion Mograine^Thrall^^The Battle For The Ebon Hold^^Deliver the letter to Thrall, Warchief of the Horde at Orgrimmar.^You are now, and forever will be, a Knight of the Ebon Blade, <name>, but know this: you were once a hero of the Horde. <Darion stares at you.> This order must establish allies for itself if it is to survive. You must represent the Knights of the Ebon Blade to the Horde. On the platform, southeast of me, is a portal to Orgrimmar. Take this letter, given to me on your behalf by Lord Fordring, and deliver it to Thrall. Use the portal.All Things in Good Time^80^All^Ahn'kahet: The Old Kingdom^Kilix the Unraveler^Kilix the Unraveler^^^^Kilix the Unraveler in the Pit of Narjun wants you to obtain an Ahn'kahar Watcher's Corpse and place it upon the Ahn'kahet Brazier in Ahn'kahet.^Ahn'kahet, from whence we came... One day, I dream, we shall overcome the death and darkness that hold our ancient home in their grip. To that end, I have a plan to weaken the resolve of our enemies. Their precious Watchers must burn! Take their corpses and place them upon the brazier deep within the city. The scent of their burnt remains will linger in the air, reminding our enemy of their weakness. Be mindful, <class>! Their undead corpses are most fragile and will deteriorate rapidly.Fueling the Demolishers^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Siegesmith Stronghoof^Commander Dardosh^^^^Siegesmith Stronghoof at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Eternal Embers from Alliance players in the Cauldron of Flames.^Lok'tar, <name>! While the battle may be over, we must prepare for the Alliance's next assault! Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in south eastern Wintergrasp and retrieve ten eternal embers. The embers are mixed in with coal to fuel the Demolishers and Siege Engines. We've heard reports of Alliance pigs collecting the embers all day. Slay them and take their embers! If they have already abandoned the area, then be prepared to fight the fire elementals there until you find some!Warding the Walls^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Hoodoo Master Fu'jin^Hoodoo Master Fu'jin^^^^Hoodoo Master Fu'jin at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Enchanted Alliance Breastplates at the Glacial Falls.^Hey 'mon. This place be givin' me dah heebie jeebies, don't cha know? Way too many spirits haunting dis place. I want ta be placing hoodoo wards up, but I be needin' some souls, mon. Not any soul though, only da soul of a strong warrior could do da job. The Glacial Falls in east Wintergrasp be havin' dem special properties to extract da soul. Slay the Alliance there, mebbe they be havin' the stuff we need. Bring back da armor of the slain. If there be no Alliance maybe da elementals got 'em, mon.Bones and Arrows^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Vieron Blazefeather^Vieron Blazefeather^^^^Lieutenant Vieron Blazefeather at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Quivers of Dragonbone Arrows from Alliance players in the Forest of Shadows.^Why would they set me to the task of arming our archers? I was a poet, not a ranger! Well, no use complaining. <name>, I am in need of dragon bone for our arrowheads. Travel to the Forest of Shadows on the western side of Wintergrasp. Ever since the last skirmish, the Alliance have been scavenging dragon bones in the area. Slay them and take the bones. If that fails, you might be lucky and get one from the spirits in the area. I hear they love to impale their living victims on the bones as they die.Healing with Roses^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Primalist Mulfort^Primalist Mulfort^^^^Primalist Mulfort wants you to retrieve 10 Alliance Herb Pouches from Alliance players at the Steppe of Life.^Between the battles, one might almost believe that there was hope for peace in this land. Sadly, that is not to be our fate. Travel to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp. I have need of the roses that grow there for salve to treat the wounded. Sadly, the rose has become scarce due to the Alliance harvesting it too rapidly. Slay them on the Steppe of Life and retrieve their herb pouches from the bodies. If that fails, perhaps a lasher or two might have one.A Rare Herb^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Anchorite Tessa^Anchorite Tessa^^^^Anchorite Tessa in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Horde Herb Pouches from Horde players in the Steppe of Life.^My, it is quite chilly up here! Reminds me of the stormy peaks of Kaarinos on Argus. However, with all of this snow and ice, our soldiers can easily catch cold. Head to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp, and bring me back 10 Horde Herb Pouches. I will grind the herbs into a medicine to protect against the cold. The Horde have been seen collecting them from the plant life in the area. Do not hesitate to slay them and retrieve the herbs! You may also find one on a lasher in the area.Bones and Arrows^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Bowyer Randolph^Bowyer Randolph^^^^Bowyer Randolph in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Quivers of Dragonbone Arrows from Horde players at the Forest of Shadows.^Dragons are incredible! Well, their bones at least! I've been equipping our archers with arrowheads made of Dragonbone. Unfortunately, since the massacre at Angrathar, it has become almost impossible to get bone from Dragonblight. However, the Forest of Shadows on the western edge of Wintergrasp has enough bones to tide us over. Head to the Forest of Shadows and bring back any bone splinters you can find! The Horde have been seen collecting bone splinters in the area. Slay them!Fueling the Demolishers^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Siege Master Stouthandle^Commander Zanneth^^^^Siegesmith Stouthandle in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Eternal Embers from Horde players at the Cauldron of Flames.^<name>! About time you showed up. While we may have lost the last battle, we should prepare for the next! Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in southeastern Wintergrasp and retrieve several eternal embers. The embers are mixed in with coal to fuel the Demolisher and Siege Engines. Oh, and if you happen to see some of the Horde in the Cauldron, don't hesitate to slay them and take their embers. We must prevent them from holding the keep!Warding the Warriors^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Sorceress Kaylana^Sorceress Kaylana^^^^Sorceress Kaylana in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 sets of Imbued Horde Armor at the Glacial Falls.^<name>, good to see you. We must prepare for our next assault on the fortress. My research indicates that the armor of soldiers recently slain in the Glacial Falls becomes imbued with an incredible amount of energy. The Horde has been collecting armor in the area. Head to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me. If you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.Bones and Arrows^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Vieron Blazefeather^Vieron Blazefeather^^^^Lieutenant Vieron Blazefeather in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Quivers of Dragonbone Arrows from Alliance players at the Forest of Shadows.^Why would they set me to the task of arming our archers? I was a poet, not a ranger! Well, no use complaining. <name>, I am in need of dragon bone for our arrowheads. Travel to the Forest of Shadows on the western side of Wintergrasp. Ever since the last skirmish, the Alliance have been scavenging dragon bones in the area. Slay them and take the bones. If that fails, you might be lucky and get one from the spirits in the area. I hear they love to impale their living victims on the bones as they die.Fueling the Demolishers^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Siegesmith Stronghoof^Commander Dardosh^^^^Siegesmith Stronghoof in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Eternal Embers from Alliance players at the Cauldron of Flames.^Lok'tar, <name>! While the battle may have subsided, we must prepare to retake the fortress! Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in south eastern Wintergrasp and retrieve ten eternal embers. The embers are mixed in with coal to fuel the Demolishers and Siege Engines. We've heard reports of Alliance pigs collecting the embers all day. Slay them and take their embers! If they have already abandoned the area, then be prepared to fight the fire elementals there until you find some!Healing with Roses^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Primalist Mulfort^Primalist Mulfort^^^^Primalist Mulfort in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Alliance Herb Pouches from Alliance players at the Steppe of Life.^So many of our braves were lost during the battle, but even more shall die if left untreated. Travel to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp. I have need of the roses that grow there for salve to treat the wounded. Sadly, the rose has become scarce due to the Alliance harvesting it too rapidly. Slay them on the Steppe of Life and retrieve their herb pouches from the bodies. If that fails, perhaps a lasher or two might be in bloom.Jinxing the Walls^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Hoodoo Master Fu'jin^Hoodoo Master Fu'jin^^^^Hoodoo Master Fu'jin in Wintergrasp wants you to retrieve 10 Enchanted Alliance Breastplates from Alliance players at the Glacial Falls.^Hey 'mon. See dem Alliance sitting comfy in their keep? I think they be a bit too comfy, ya? I want ta be jinxing the place, but I be needin' some souls, mon. Not any soul though, only da soul of a strong warrior could do da job. The Glacial Falls in east Wintergrasp be havin' dem special properties to extract da soul. Slay the Alliance there, they be havin' the stuff we need. Bring back da armor of the slain. If there be no Alliance maybe da elementals got 'em, mon.Funky Fungi^76^All^Ahn'kahet: The Old Kingdom^Ooze-covered Fungus^Kilix the Unraveler^^^^You are to collect 6 Grotesque Fungus from Savage Cave Beasts in Ahn'kahet and deliver them to Kilix the Unraveler in The Pit of Narjun.^A misshapen piece of mushroom-like fungus falls from a particularly smelly, ooze-covered patch of the cave beast's flesh. Examining it, you are violently repulsed by its overwhelming stench. You wonder to yourself if this is the kind of thing that the nerubians might find appetizing. Placing the sticky organism in your pack, you determine to find out...Disarmament^71^Alliance^Utgarde Keep^Defender Mordun^Defender Mordun^^^^Defender Mordun wants you to enter Utgarde Keep and steal 5 Vrykul Weapons^Take it from me, <lad/lass>, them vrykul weapons be downright nasty! I've felt their edge personally, and there be somethin' unnatural about 'em. Deceptively well-balanced, wickedly sharp - just plain deadly. Get into their stronghold and if nuthin' else, pilfer some o' them weapons! Mebbe we can learn us a thing 'er two about 'em, mebbe not. Bottom line - the fewer axes they be swingin' around, the better.Disarmament^71^Horde^Utgarde Keep^Dark Ranger Marrah^High Executor Anselm^^^^Dark Ranger Marrah wants you to steal 5 Vrykul Weapons from Utgarde Keep and bring them to High Executor Anselm in Vengeance Landing.^We must discover the secret to these savages' weapons! If you'd have seen how easily they cut through my companions, you'd understand my sense of urgency. Just have a look at their forge if you doubt my words. Scour the place. Gather all of their arms that you can carry and bring them to Anselm for his inspection. Do not fail us, <class>. Every weapon you are able to bring out of this place is one less that we must face in the field.Halls of Stone^78^All^Halls of Stone^Brann Bronzebeard^Brann Bronzebeard^^^^Brann Bronzebeard wants you to accompany him as he uncovers the secrets that lie in the Halls of Stone.^Well now, I'm surprised to see other adventurers in a place such as this! It so happens that I could use a bit o' company for what lies ahead. If my research on these halls is accurate, there be monumental discoveries to be made here! Assumin' I can count on ya to watch my back, you're welcome to tag along. So, what'dya say, <class>? Care ta join me?By Fire Be Purged^80^All^Icecrown^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^Crusader Olakin Sainrith^^^Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton^Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch wants you to burn 7 Festering Corpses using Olakin's Torch.^The Scourge uses our own fallen against us, by raising them as ghouls or skeletons, or by dismembering their corpses and using the parts to make abominations. This must stop! The dead are heroes who fell in defense of all the living, and they cannot be confined to so grisly a fate. Moreover, we cannot afford to face them again on the field, used as weapons against us. Take this torch with you to the Fleshwerks, and burn any of the corpses you find in the Sanctum of Reanimation or the abomination lab.He's Gone to Pieces^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^He's Gone to Pieces^Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton^^Recover Olakin's Torso, Olakin's Legs, Olakin's Left Arm, and Olakin's Right Arm and bring them to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.^With the abduction of Crusader Olakin, the Argent Crusade's forces will have no commander in the final assault on the Fleshwerks. While one crusader is the same as any other to me, the argents won't see it that way. I hate to see us waste time chasing after this, but I have no choice. Our gallant crusader has likely been dismembered by now, and his remains used to construct abominations. Go down into the Fleshwerks, kill the corpulent horrors fighting our forces, and recover Olakin's body parts.Battle at Valhalas^80^All^Icecrown^The Bone Witch^Geirrvif^The Sum is Greater than the Parts^^Battle at Valhalas: Fallen Heroes^Speak with Geirrvif in Valhalas.^I see and hear many things, <name>, and something very important has happened since your defeat of Overthane Balargarde: you are wanted for battle in Valhalas! You will find the battle pit to the north. Go now with your friends and speak with Geirrvif the val'kyr. The challengers that she will offer you within Valhalas are sure to require their help. Good luck.Battle at Valhalas: Fallen Heroes^80^All^Icecrown^Geirrvif^Gjonner the Merciless^^Battle at Valhalas^Battle at Valhalas: Khit'rix the Dark Ma^Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to, in a single combat, defeat all six of the fallen heroes: Eldreth, Geness Half-Soul, Jhadras, Masud, Rith, and Talla.^If you believe yourself ready to begin then I have just the match for you to cut your teeth on. Another group of outsiders thought themselves prepared for the rigors of Valhalas. They had much hubris, but in the end they fell like all of the others. If you think yourselves so different -- if you think that you have the skill and experience to fight here amongst such storied warriors -- then please accept the challenge.Battle at Valhalas: Khit'rix the Dark Master^80^All^Icecrown^Geirrvif^Gjonner the Merciless^^Battle at Valhalas: Fallen Heroes^Battle at Valhalas: The Return of Sigrid^Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Khit'rix the Dark Master.^A variety of beings travel the world to prove themselves within Valhalas. Some even come from under the world. Khit'rix the Dark Master is one such. Hailing from deep within the ground where insanity reigns, Khit'rix has asked for someone exotic to face in the ring. You will do. Dare you face this Nerubian nightmare, <race>?Battle at Valhalas: The Return of Sigrid Iceborn^80^All^Icecrown^Geirrvif^Gjonner the Merciless^^Battle at Valhalas: Khit'rix the Dark Ma^Battle at Valhalas: Carnage!^Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Sigrid Iceborn.^An old foe of yours has returned: Sigrid Iceborn. Perhaps you remember besting her in a duel upon the Savage Ledge? No matter, she certainly remembers you. She's insisting upon a chance to prove herself once more. Personally, I think it's more a chance for revenge, but that too can be useful in this place. I leave it up to you, <name>. Will you face Sigrid Iceborn once more?Battle at Valhalas: Carnage!^80^All^Icecrown^Geirrvif^Gjonner the Merciless^^Battle at Valhalas: The Return of Sigrid^Battle at Valhalas: Thane Deathblow^Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Carnage.^You've been successful up to this point, <name>, but what you must face to continue to battle within Valhalas is a gigantic horror beyond imagining. I must warn you to turn away now. Carnage is a mountain of flesh constructed by the Lich King's most fiendish minds. I do not see how you and your friends will defeat it. However, the choice is yours.Battle at Valhalas: Thane Deathblow^80^All^Icecrown^Geirrvif^Gjonner the Merciless^^Battle at Valhalas: Carnage!^Battle at Valhalas: Final Challenge^Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Thane Banahogg, the Deathblow.^Your skills have not gone unnoticed by the vrykul of Jotunheim, <name>. Thane Banahogg has taken a personal interest in you and has insisted that he be your next match. If you thought Carnage was bad, then you might want to go home now. Thane Banahogg's nickname is The Deathblow. I think you can guess how he earned it. Do you accept the thane's challenge?Battle at Valhalas: Final Challenge^80^All^Icecrown^Geirrvif^Gjonner the Merciless^^Battle at Valhalas: Thane Deathblow^^Geirrvif at Valhalas has challenged you to defeat Prince Sandoval.^I'm afraid that your success is going to be your undoing, <name>. <If the val'kyr could turn more white, she would.> Word of your success in Valhalas has reached deep into Icecrown Citadel, stirring one whom you have no desire to meet. Prince Sandoval himself is on his way at this very moment. Gjonner warned you that you should run and I cannot disagree. What will you do? He's on his way. Will you face the blood prince in final battle?Putting Olakin Back Together Again^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^He's Gone to Pieces^^^Obtain a Spool of Thread and the Doctor's Cleaver, then take them to the Sanctum of Reanimation Slab and use Olakin's remains to attempt to reanimate the crusader. Return to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch when this task is complete.^We can't afford to waste any time putting Olakin back together. Fortunately, the Scourge has provided a perfect place for you to stitch him back together. Near the Fleshwerks' flesh giant lab is the Sanctum of Reanimation. Search the area for a spool of thread and the doctor's cleaver. Then, take Olakin's remains to the large slab in the middle of the sanctum and get to work.I'm Not Dead Yet!^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Father Kamaros^Absalan the Pious^^Where Are They Coming From?^^Escort Father Kamaros to safety and then report to Absalan the Pious aboard the Skybreaker.^The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape. I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again. Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off?Defend the Siege^80^Alliance^Wintergrasp^Senior Demolitionist Legoso^Senior Demolitionist Legoso^^^^Senior Demolitionist Legoso in Wintergrasp wants you to pilot or protect a siege device as it destroys three structures.^Front and center, <name>! We're beginning our assault on Wintergrasp Fortress. Those Horde animals think they can hide cowardly behind their walls? Well, I think not! We'll show them the power of Gnomish technology and smash their walls to bits! However, even the most powerful siege device is helpless without a crew. Pilot or protect one of our siege vehicles as it destroys three of the Horde structures.Defend the Siege^80^Horde^Wintergrasp^Lieutenant Murp^Lieutenant Murp^^^^Lieutenant Murp in Wintergrasp wants you to defend or pilot a siege vehicle while they destroy three Alliance structures.^Dem Alliance won't be long to hold that keep. Murp would smash walls, but Murp has to stay in camp. Murp wish he could smash Alliance who want to hurt Horde demolishers. You, <name>! You go in Murp's place. Protect 3 siege vehicles while they smash Alliance buildings. Alliance not expect you to defend demolisher. Show Alliance how smart Murp is!Orgrim's Hammer^79^Horde^Icecrown^Warlord Hork Strongbrow^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^^^The Broken Front, Get to Ymirheim!, Slaves to Saronite, Blood of the Chosen, Joining the Assault^Seek out Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer flying above Icecrown.^The Argent Crusade pulled my ravaged body from the Broken Front. What a glorious battle, <race>. My axe sang as it cut down Alliance filth and Scourge alike. My time is over. It will be a good death. Carry a message for me, soldier. Our base flies out of reach of Scourge - overhead between Mord'rethar and Aldur'thar. It is called "Orgrim's Hammer." <Hork futilely attempts to salute.> Fly high and avoid the Alliance juggernaut, Skybreaker. Tell Korm... tell him I died... fighting... For the Horde.The Skybreaker^79^Alliance^Icecrown^Marshal Ivalius^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^Exploiting an Opening^Seek out High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker flying above Icecrown.^We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous... unrelenting! At some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, <race>? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance.Judgment Day Comes!^78^Alliance^Icecrown^Absalan the Pious^Highlord Tirion Fordring^^^^Report to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Argent Vanguard in Icecrown.^We cannot defeat the Lich King on our own.

Those troops were on a recon mission! And what's this talk of Alliance - you're sure he said Alliance? Listen to me, <name>! I need to know what's going on and I need to know NOW! Get yourself down there and get me some answers! Scour the battlefield and look for survivors - clues - anything!I'm Not Dead Yet!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Father Kamaros^Brother Keltan^^Where Are They Coming From?^^Escort Father Kamaros to safety and then report to Brother Keltan aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape. I cannot make it on my own, <class>, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again. Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off?Avenge Me!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Dying Berserker^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^^The Broken Front^^A Dying Berserker has asked that you slay 5 Dying Soldiers at the Broken Front. Report to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar on Orgrim's Hammer when it is done.^I hear them, <brother/sister>.... The moans of the wounded Alliance... they taunt me... Finish what we have begun here, <class>. Show no mercy... let none of them survive. For... the Horde...The Broken Front^80^Alliance^Icecrown^High Captain Justin Bartlett^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^^High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker wants you to go to the Broken Front and question a Dying Soldier, then report back to him.^What?! Noooo! We went to such great pains to keep this attack secret. How could the Horde have known? The resources... the men... all lost? Inconceivable! Our plans here in Icecrown hinged upon our taking that gate before the Horde could. We must recover quickly and prepare to mount another offensive. Visit the battlefield and search for any survivors. See if there's anything to be learned from this tragedy. And prepare yourself, <name>, for a war - on two fronts...Finish Me!^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Dying Soldier^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^^A Dying Soldier in the Broken Front wants you to kill 5 Dying Soldiers and report to High Captain Justin Bartlett on the Skybreaker.^They taunt us - even as they lie dying here... Please, <brother/miss>... Don't allow their mocking to be the last sounds I hear... Finish me... deliver me from this torment... into... the Light. Seek out my companions... offer them the same mercy. Leave nothing for the Scourge to raise! I beg you...No Mercy!^80^Alliance^Icecrown^High Captain Justin Bartlett^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^^High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker wants you to kill 15 Horde Players in Icecrown.^It is as I told you. They were not merely idle words spoken in a fit of anger. Time and again, the Horde have demonstrated their disdain for everything we hold dear and holy. They must pay with their lives for their transgressions against the light. All of them. Just imagine a world free of their stain, <name>. Envision the joy our children will know. Think of the reverence your descendants will have for your memory, knowing they owe their happiness to you. Now go, and make that vision a reality!Make Them Pay!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^^The Broken Front^^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar wants you to kill 15 Alliance Players in Icecrown.^The time has come! Too long have we suffered the company of the self-righteous Alliance! Too long have we stayed our hand from cleansing our world of the weak and the desperate. Now, we bring an end to our humiliation! Now, we show them the true meaning of fear! Now, we bring honor to the Horde! Here, at Icecrown, we break the Alliance! Go, <class>. Hunt them down. Break them. Take their will to live!The Flesh Giant Champion^80^All^Icecrown^Darkrider Arly^Darkrider Arly^He's Gone to Pieces^^^Speak with Margrave Dhakar at the western end of the Fleshworks to engage Morbidus. After you have defeated Morbidus, report to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.^You've done well in destroying the Fleshwerks and slaughtering the Lich King's servants. Now, all that remains is to defeat the Fleshwerks' greatest accomplishment -- the flesh giant known as Morbidus. It will not be an easy fight, but the Shadow Vault has dispatched Margrave Dhakar with some reinforcements. Meet up with him at the highest point at the western end of the Fleshwerks. Tell him when you're ready to begin the attack and he'll order his forces into battle.Army of the Damned^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Do Your Worst^^^Matthias Lehner at the First Legion Forward Camp wants you to raise an army of 100 Ghoulish Minions.^You probably think you're quite strong -- fighting these undead and crushing their bones beneath your war machines. That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them. I saw the prince do it himself. I can show you how it happened... if you'd like.Poke and Prod^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^Takes One to Know One^^That's Abominable!, Against the Giants^Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to go the Broken Front and defeat 5 Hulking Abominations, 5 Malefic Necromancers, and 5 Shadow Adepts.^While your commander has his focus diluted by his loathing of your Alliance rivals, you can depend on me to direct my attention squarely on the real enemy here - the Lich King and his minions. In order to hold any hope of conquering him at the citadel, your people must take and hold each gate. For now, let us focus on the first. Return to the front and prod their defenses. Look for any sign of weakness that we might exploit. I'll await your report, <class>.Good For Something?^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Good For Something?^The Broken Front^^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar wants you to speak with Chief Engineer Copperclaw aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^Goblins! Hyper little busy-bodies... Listen, <name>. Copperclaw, our resident engineer, is insisting that he's got something useful to show me. I'm in no mood to endure his squeaky nagging. The last time I acknowledged him, he chirped on for an hour straight. It was all I could do to keep from drop-kicking him into Sindragosa's Fall! You go in my place and humor him. Let me know if indeed he's on to anything.Volatility^80^Horde^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Good For Something?^^Volatility, Green Technology^Chief Engineer Copperclaw wants you to use Copperclaw's Volatile Oil at the Broken Front to attract 3 Frostbrood Skytalons.^Where to begin... well, you must know that as chief engineer of this vessel I have access to all of the intelligence reports - yes, yes, it's true, and I've recently taken a particular interest in the frostwyrms you reported seeing to the south, and I do believe I've developed a plan that just might work against them... now it'll take a little legwork on your part, but essentially, you build a dummy out of armor and coat it with a splash of this solution, then run for cover! ...You still here, <race>?Darkness Stirs^74^Horde^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^High Overlord Saurfang^Darkness Stirs^^^Gather Saurfang's Battle Armor from the field of battle and return it to High Overlord Saurfang at Warsong Hold in Borean Tundra.^Darkness stirs, <name>. A tragic event has transpired that none but the Timeless One could have foreseen. Soon your people will be gripped by anger and hatred. War is on the horizon. The red dragonflight has done all that it can. What happens next is in the hands of the mortal races of Azeroth. Regrettably, your journey begins with anguish. A father has lost a child today. You must bear the grim news. Gather the armaments of Saurfang and return them to the elder Saurfang.Herald of War^74^Horde^Borean Tundra^High Overlord Saurfang^Thrall^Darkness Stirs^^^Report to Thrall at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar.^The Warchief needs you, champion. Orgrimmar is in a state of martial law. All merchants and services have been shut down as the Warchief prepares for an unavoidable conflict. I cannot tell you much more - not now. Not in this place. The Warchief commands that our strongest champions report to his throne room. Go now, <name>! Take the portal back to Orgrimmar and seek out Thrall.Opportunity^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Sergeant Kregga^Opportunity^^^Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel.^We recently came upon schematics that indicate a weakness in Icecrown Citadel. An opening in its defenses, both figuratively and literally. The captured diagrams show an orifice leading several hundred feet into the ground. We're unsure of its purpose, but our scouting has revealed it to be of high importance to the Scourge. Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel, she's leading the attack on the site.Establishing Superiority^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sergeant Kregga^Sergeant Kregga^Opportunity^^^Sergeant Kregga at Icecrown Citadel wants you to slay 10 Hulking Horrors.^We've one shot at dealing some damage to this place -- let's make sure we get it right. We've acquired potent, Scourge-made, saronite bombs. But we must secure this area before we can set them off. We're going to need to get the Scourge defenses under control quickly, before reinforcements arrive. Help my men out and come back when you're ready for some fireworks.Takes One to Know One^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^Koltira Deathweaver^Takes One to Know One^The Broken Front^^Sky-Reaver Korm wants you to speak to Koltira Deathweaver on Orgrim's Hammer.^While we should never miss an opportunity to strike out against the Alliance, we mustn't forget about the Scourge. We won't have the numbers here to make a proper assault in the glacier for weeks, but that won't keep us from learning all we can know about their defenses. I have asked our resident death knight to advise you in this effort. After all, who better knows this enemy than they? Allow me to introduce Koltira Deathweaver.Volatility^80^Horde^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^^Volatility^^Chief Engineer Copperclaw wants you to use Copperclaw's Volatile Oil at the Broken Front to attract 3 Frostbrood Skytalons.^Wahooo! It works! Not that I had any doubts in my supernatural ingenuity, only that I wasn't quite sure what kind of explosion to expect - let's just say I'm glad to see that you didn't get your eyebrows singed off. So now I just need to show ol' Korm how ya thaw out one 'a them wyrms. He'll hafta promote me to... to... to whatever comes after Chief Engineer! Here, you take another batch of the stuff and head back out to the front and I'll go get Korm... Well? Move out!Blow it Up!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sergeant Kregga^Saronite Bomb Stack^Opportunity^^^Go to the nearby Saronite Bomb Stack to light the fuse.^This is probably as under-control as this situation is going to get. Let's do this, <name>. I need someone to light the fuse on those bombs and it looks like you're the one to do it.A Short Fuse^80^Horde^Icecrown^Saronite Bomb Stack^Pulsing Crystal^Opportunity^^Parting Gifts^Look for clues wherever the fall takes you.^As you light the fuse, you notice that it is consumed by fire far quicker than you would expect. The bombs are about to go off and your best chance at surviving is to lean towards the pit and hope the fall doesn't kill you.That's Abominable!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Poke and Prod^That's Abominable!, Sneak Preview^Koltira Deathweaver on Orgrim's Hammer wants you to use the Abomination Reanimation Kit to create a Reanimated Abomination, which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers.^Abominations... They can be a very capable enemy. I've seen them turn the tide of battle more than once. What few realize, is that they can also be very capable friends. They are not deep thinkers. If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question. Fortunately for you, I know these secrets. This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat. Take it, and learn to use them against the Scourge on the death gate.A Life Without Regret^74^Horde^Orgrimmar^Thrall^Vol'jin^Darkness Stirs^^^Take the portal to Undercity located in Grommash Hold and report to Vol'jin.^On the day of my death I wish to be able to say that I lived a life without regret. Those who mourn my passing will know that I was a Warchief who made decisions that best served his people. But this betrayal by Varimathras and Putress... All that we have worked for is for nothing. <Thrall's chest heaves with a heavy sigh.> Justice must be served. Portals to Undercity will be active momentarily. Vol'jin will be waiting for you. I will meet you there soon. Together we will make it right, <name>.The Battle For The Undercity^74^Horde^Undercity^Vol'jin^Thrall^Darkness Stirs^^^Assist Thrall and Sylvanas in retaking the Undercity for the Horde.^The entirety of the Undercity is controlled by Varimathras. Our soldiers stand ready, waiting for the Warchief to give the attack orders. Help the Horde take back the Undercity and earn your place among our greatest champions! Should you survive the assault, report to Thrall. Check in with the Warchief when you are ready to begin.A Voice in the Dark^80^Horde^Icecrown^Pulsing Crystal^Matthias Lehner^Opportunity^^^Investigate the nearby voice in Naz'anak, the Forgotten Depths.^The object is not a crystal at all, but some form of organ, encased in ice. As you touch it, your hand reels in horrible pain. You feel as if your hand has been cut, yet there is no visible wound. As you collect your thoughts, you hear a young boy's voice nearby. "You really shouldn't have done that."Going After the Core^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Brann Bronzebeard^Going After the Core^Norgannon's Shell^^Find Prospector Khrona's Notes and Prospector Soren's Maps at Brann's Base-Camp.^With Norgannon's Shell in hand, only half of the archive key remains to be found. Luckily, I've had the Explorers' League hard at work chasing down leads about the whereabouts of Norgannon's Core. Far to the southeast of the Inventor's Library, on the slopes to the north of Dun Niffelem, is a camp bearing my name. The Explorers' League representatives seeking the second half of the key are based there. Bring me the maps and the notes they've made and we should be able to track down the other key half.The Core's Keeper^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Brann Bronzebeard^Going After the Core^^^Obtain Norgannon's Core.^Prospector Soren's notes say that Norgannon's Core is in the keeping of a sentinel named Athan, one of Mimir's creations. Soren says the vault where Athan resides is called "Loken's Bargain" these days. Loken, eh? The earthen have mentioned him. The vault is said to be southwest of the ruined Explorers' League camp, with a round entrance on a mountainside overlooking the Valley of Ancient Winters. Find this Athan and get the core from him, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were in for a fight.Time to Hide^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Opportunity^^^Matthias Lehner wants you to obtain 3 Faceless One's Blood.^You shouldn't have touched it. But now that you did, he's going to come looking for you. And he'll find you. Unless you hide yourself from him. Bring me blood from the faceless ones if you want to live!That's Abominable!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^That's Abominable!^^Koltira Deathweaver on Orgrim's Hammer wants you to use the Abomination Reanimation Kit to create a Reanimated Abomination, which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers.^You know what to do, <class>. Take this kit and use the guts from their abominations to create one of your own, then command it to attack the enemy forces at the gate. You would do well to refine this tactic for when we make our assault on the gate.Against the Giants^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^Against the Giants^Poke and Prod^^Koltira Deathweaver on Orgrim's Hammer wants you to bring him 5 Pustulant Spines from the Pustulant Horrors on Mord'rethar.^While it's going to be crucial to defeat the Scourge on the ground, we mustn't neglect the gate itself. The flesh giants on the ramparts are capable of hurling massive boulders and chunks of ice, inflicting devastating damage to enemy infantry below. Muster a force and defeat these giants. We need to know just what we're up against in terms of their strength. Oh... and bring me their spines. If memory serves, there's a little trick I can share with you.Coprous the Defiled^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^^^Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to kill Coprous the Defiled at Mord'rethar.^Reports of a powerful zombie at the death gate have reached my ears, <class>. We cannot allow a potential threat such as this to go unchallenged. Any information you are able to glean from engaging it will be better than what we know now. Go to the western chamber of the gate and find this creature. Fight him, and find a weakness we might exploit.Basic Chemistry^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^Against the Giants^^Neutralizing the Plague^Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar.^<Koltira takes the pustulant spines and drains their fluid into a flask.> A little-known quality of the flesh giants... Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid. Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers. Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate.King of the Mountain^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Frazzle Geargrinder^Frazzle Geargrinder^Get to Ymirheim!^^^Frazzle Geargrinder in Ymirheim wants you to use her Geargrinder's Jumpbot to plant the Alliance Battle Standard in the skulls at the top of the mountain.^You've just got to get my jumpbot to the tippy top of the mountain to the northwest here at Ymirheim pronto, <name>! That dastardly, no-good Blast Thunderbomb is working on his own bot, and I'm afraid he almost has it completed. We're in a race to see who's gonna be king of the mountain! Once you jump up there, plant our battle standard in the pile of bones and show everyone that the Alliance, and my engineering skills, are the best!Neutralizing the Plague^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Basic Chemistry^^Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a blight cauldron at Mord'rethar.^You no longer need my assistance in neutralizing the enemy's plague cauldrons, <race>. Hunt down the flesh giants at the death gate and use the fluid from their spines to render batches of the plague ineffective. You are striking at the heart of the enemy's strategy. This is an important mission - vital to our cause, and should be carried out whenever time permits. Remember, the giants and the plague cauldrons can be found on Mord'rethar.Return to the Surface^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Koltira Deathweaver^Opportunity^^^Return to Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^You should leave now. You'll find a portal behind me. It'll take you to the surface. We'll meet again. He'll be looking for you. It's only a matter of time until he finds you.King of the Mountain^80^Horde^Icecrown^Blast Thunderbomb^Blast Thunderbomb^Get to Ymirheim!^^^Blast Thunderbomb in Ymirheim wants you to use his Thunderbomb's Jumpbot to plant the Horde Battle Standard in the skulls at the top of the mountain.^Yo, <name>, I need you to get my jumpbot to the top of this mountain to the southeast, like yesterday! That girly, self-righteous Frazzle Geargrinder thinks that her jumpbot's better than mine. Hah! We're in a race to see who's gonna be king of the mountain! Once you jump up there, plant our battle standard in the pile of bones and show everyone that the Horde, and my mad engineering skills, are the best!Assault by Ground^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Skybreaker Squad Leader^Ground Commander Koup^^^^Escort the Skybreaker troops to the gates of Ymirheim. Return to Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim for compensation after the task is complete.^Greetings <class>. Our troops have been attempting to storm Ymirheim for some time, but these vrykul are far more vicious than any we've faced before. They've been ambushing us repeatedly as we try to make it up the pass, and we've lost a lot of men. If you want to lend yourself to the battle and help get my squad to the gates of Ymirheim safely, we will gladly reward you for your efforts. Once at the gates, we'll dig in and wait for reinforcements to catch up to us.Forging the Keystone^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Boktar Bloodfury^Going After the Core^^^Brann Bronzebeard wants you to meet him at the Temple of Invention and help him combine Norgannon's Shell and Norgannon's Core. Once you have helped Brann, report back to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.^Aha! Here it is: the Temple of Invention, the seat of Keeper Mimir himself! Of course, that's where one would go to join the two parts of the key. According to the prospector's notes, the Temple of Invention is one of the highest points on the western side of the Terrace of the Makers. That means it should be roughly east of your Grom'arsh Crash Site. I'll meet you at the temple and we'll combine the parts together....All the Help We Can Get.^80^Alliance^Icecrown^High Captain Justin Bartlett^Thassarian^...All the Help We Can Get.^^^High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker wants you to speak to Thassarian.^Desperate times, <class>... As uncomfortable as it makes me, I'm prepared to accept assistance from anyone - including our resident death knight. Go to Thassarian and see if he can help us develop tactics against the Scourge that will ensure victory once we are able to mount another offensive. We have come so far... we must not fail here!Poke and Prod^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^...All the Help We Can Get.^^^Thassarian on the Alliance gunship, Skybreaker, wants you to kill 5 Hulking Abominations, 5 Malefic Necromancers, and 5 Shadow Adepts at the Broken Front.^As someone of your experience must surely know, there's no better way to familiarize one's self with their enemy than by confronting them in combat. While you no doubt lust for the glory of taking Icecrown Citadel, that cannot happen without taking each of the Lich King's gates first. For now, you must focus your efforts on the first of these... Return to the Broken Front. Engage the enemy in battle. Search for a weakness we might exploit and return to me with a detailed report.That's Abominable!^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian on the Skybreaker wants you to use the Abomination Reanimation Kit to create a Reanimated Abomination, which you are to use to kill 15 Icy Ghouls, 15 Vicious Geists, and 15 Risen Alliance Soldiers.^Abominations...

Take this kit and use the guts from their abominations to create one of your own, then command it to attack the enemy forces at the gate. You would do well to refine this tactic for when we make another assault on the gate.Your Attention, Please^80^Alliance^Icecrown^High Captain Justin Bartlett^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Your Attention, Please^^^High Captain Bartlett wants you to speak with Chief Engineer Boltwrench in the Skybreaker.^Chief Engineer Boltwrench has proven invaluable in his service aboard the Stormbreaker. Were it not for his ingenuity, we'd be sprinkled across half of the glacier several times over by now. The thing is, he feels he must share his every miniscule invention or discovery - most of which I don't even understand. My focus must be squarely on our enemies right now. I cannot afford any distractions. Please visit him in my stead, <name>. And if you can, assist him. You'll find him belowdecks.Borrowed Technology^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Your Attention, Please^^The Solution Solution, Killohertz^Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use the Smuggled Solution at the Broken Front.^I get it, I get it. Cappy's too busy to see this for himself. His loss! See, I've managed to 'acquire' a certain shipment of solution from the enemy. And as much as I hate tinkerin' with inferior goblin technology, I'm inclined to make an exception here. Take this sample. I'll need you to run a few field tests, just to prove its usefulness, while I try to do a little reverse engineering to duplicate the creation process. Go to the front and gather the materials to make a decoy, then use the oil.The Solution Solution^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^^Borrowed Technology^^Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use the Smuggled Solution at the Broken Front.^Oh, yes, yes. Back again, are we? Never enough practice, I suppose. Here we are, the solution to that pesky frostwyrm problem. Make them scarce, <race>. The more you take out now, the less we face when we are again ready to attempt our march on the citadel. Best of luck, now. And do bring back whatever you don't use.Get to Ymirheim!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Blast Thunderbomb^Get to Ymirheim!^Orgrim's Hammer^^Speak with Blast Thunderbomb in Ymirheim.^You need to get down to Ymirheim, that big frost vrykul town in the middle of Icecrown. Our boy, Blast Thunderbomb, is down there on the west side of town representing the Warsong Offensive in a competition against the Alliance. It's his jumpbot versus theirs in a king of the mountain contest! Don't let us down, <name>. Goblin engineering pride is on the line! Besides, all the boys here in the hold are counting on you. That and we've got money riding on it that you can kick those cowards in the pants!Against the Giants^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^Against the Giants^^^Thassarian on the Skybreaker wants you to bring him 5 Pustulant Spines from the Pustulant Horrors on Mord'rethar.^While it's going to be crucial to defeat the Scourge on the ground, we mustn't neglect the gate itself.

We need to know just what we're up against in terms of their strength. Oh... and bring me their spines. If memory serves, there's a little trick I can share with you.Basic Chemistry^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^Against the Giants^^^Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar.^<Thassarian takes the pustulant spines and drains their fluid into a flask.> A little-known quality of the flesh giants... Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid. Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers. Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate.Get to Ymirheim!^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Frazzle Geargrinder^Get to Ymirheim!^^^Speak with Frazzle Geargrinder in Ymriheim.^I need you down in Ymirheim, that big frost vrykul town in the middle of Icecrown. Frazzle Geargrinder is down there on the south side of town representing the Valiance Expedition in a competition against the Horde scum. It's her jumpbot versus theirs in a king of the mountain contest! Don't let us down, <name>. Gnomish engineering pride is on the line! Besides, all the boys here in the hold are counting on you. That and we've got money riding on it that you can kick those idiots in the pants!Neutralizing the Plague^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you use Pustulant Spinal Fluid on a plague cauldron at Mord'rethar.^You no longer need my assistance in neutralizing the enemy's plague cauldrons, <race>. Hunt down the flesh giants at the death gate and use the fluid from their spines to render batches of the plague ineffective. You are striking at the heart of the enemy's strategy. This is an important mission - vital to our cause, and should be carried out whenever time permits. Remember, the giants and the plague cauldrons can be found on Mord'rethar.Coprous the Defiled^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to kill Coprous the Defiled at Mord'rethar.^Reports of a powerful zombie at the death gate have reached my ears, <class>. We cannot allow a potential threat such as this to go unchallenged. Any information you are able to glean from engaging it will be better than what we know now. Go to the western chamber of the gate and find this creature. Fight him, and find a weakness we might exploit.Slaves to Saronite^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Absalan the Pious^Absalan the Pious^^^^Absalan the Pious aboard the Skybreaker wants you to rescue 10 Saronite Mine Slaves.^Our people are being captured and put to work as slaves in the saronite mines of Ymirheim, the vrykul stronghold in the middle of Icecrown. The Lich King has them mining that unholy ore day and night. I made a promise to Highlord Fordring that we would get those wretches out of there alive, and that's exactly what we will do. Unfortunately, I've been ordered to stay on this gunship and serve as an ambassador to the Valiance Expedition. Will you please rescue them in my stead, <name>?Assault by Ground^80^Horde^Icecrown^Kor'kron Squad Leader^Ground Commander Xutjja^^Joining the Assault^^Escort the Kor'kron troops to the gates of Ymirheim. Return to Ground Commander Xutjja at the edge of the glacier north of Ymirheim for compensation after the task is complete.^Greetings <class>. Our troops have been attempting to storm Ymirheim for some time, but these vrykul are far more vicious than any we've faced before. They've been ambushing us repeatedly as we try to make it up the pass, and we've lost a lot of men. If you want to lend yourself to the battle and help get my squad to the gates of Ymirheim safely, we will gladly reward you for your efforts. Once at the gates, we'll dig in and wait for reinforcements to catch up to us.Slaves to Saronite^80^Horde^Icecrown^Brother Keltan^Brother Keltan^^Orgrim's Hammer^^Brother Keltan aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to rescue 10 Saronite Mine Slaves.^Our people are being captured and put to work as slaves in the saronite mines of Ymirheim, the vrykul stronghold in the middle of Icecrown. The Lich King has them mining that unholy ore day and night. I made a promise to Highlord Fordring that we would get those wretches out of there alive, and that's exactly what we will do. Unfortunately, I've been ordered to stay on this gunship and serve as an ambassador to the Warsong Offensive. Will you please rescue them in my stead, <name>?Field Repairs^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Wrecked Demolisher^Opportunity^^Do Your Worst^Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to collect 5 Demolisher Parts from the Scavenging Geists in the Valley of Lost Hope and take them to the Wrecked Demolisher.^The Scourge is still reeling from our attack, <name>. Now is the time to capitalize on our momentum. The strategically important valley below us is wide open. We've located a disassembled demolisher vehicle in what we believe is working condition in the southeastern corner of the Valley of Lost Hope area. If you can get the remaining parts from the Scourge scavengers, you should be able to get it running again. A single working demolisher can wreak havoc on the enemy's ground units.Do Your Worst^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Do Your Worst^Field Repairs^^Use the Refurbished Demolisher to destroy 150 Decomposed Ghouls, 20 Frostskull Mages and 2 Bone Giants in the Valley of Lost Hope. Speak to Matthias Lehner at the First Legion Forward Camp when you've completed this task.^You're going to use this machine against the Scourge? You're not going to win against them like that. You can destroy hundreds... even thousands of them. But you won't win. Not out here. When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north. There is an old army encampment. What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against.Raise the Barricades^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Need More Info^Bloodspattered Banners, The Ironwall Rampart, Blinding the Eyes in the Sky^Koltira Deathweaver, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to construct 8 Barricades using your Barricade Construction Kit.^When our forces begin to move beyond Aldur'thar, they will be vulnerable to attack from the Ironwall Rampart and the broad glacier below. We have neither the time nor the materials to build fortifications, but we can put up some barricades to shield our men from fire and break up Scourge charges. Take this barricade kit to the Valley of Fallen Heroes, on the west side of Aldur'thar. Locate the markers I've placed there and use this kit to construct your barricades there.Bloodspattered Banners^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Raise the Barricades^Before the Gate of Horror^Koltira Deathweaver, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to kill 5 Scourge Banner-Bearers, 5 Scourge Converters, and 20 Converted Heroes.^In the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar, the Scourge seeks to use the fallen against us. Scourge lieutenants have woken the valley's dead and imbued them with fearsome strength and fervor. The banners carried by the Scourge leaders in the glacier area are the source of these powers. Kill the banner-bearers, and you will weaken the converted heroes they lead. It falls to you to rid us of this obstacle, and thin the resistance before the main body can advance.Mind Tricks^80^All^Icecrown^Darkspeaker R'khem^Darkspeaker R'khem^^^^Darkspeaker R'khem in the Saronite Mines wants you to recover the Foreman's Key to his chains.^<The creature speaks directly into your mind, its thoughts painful and strange.> <race>-thing, I am in need of your assistance. Like your enslaved friends, I am a victim of the Lich King's ymirjar and their avarice. When I rose from below to investigate the noises coming from this cavern they captured and chained me. Will you please help me? The foreman of these mines holds the key to my chains. Kill him! <You can feel a pushing against your mind as if the creature is trying to coerce you.>Assault by Air^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Ground Commander Koup^Ground Commander Koup^^^^Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Skybreaker Suppression Turret to keep the Skybreaker Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops.^I've got some boys suited and ready for their drops inside of Ymirheim. I could use you to see them there safely. Inside the walls, the vrykul have set up some kind of automated spear guns that have been tearing up our transports. We had our engineers install a Suppression Turret to shut down those spear guns - just fire a round near any gun and the smoke should block its sight and clog its gears. Hop on the turret and see to it that all my boys make it to their drops in one piece.Assault by Air^80^Horde^Icecrown^Ground Commander Xutjja^Ground Commander Xutjja^^Joining the Assault^^Ground Commander Xutjja at the edge of the glacier north of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Kor'kron Suppression Turret to keep the Kor'kron Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops.^Alright scrub, I've got something to keep you from being a complete waste. A unit of highly trained infiltrators is ready to be dropped inside of Ymirheim. The vrykul inside have automated spear guns that have been ripping our transports to shreds, so we had the engineers on Orgrim's Hammer whip us up a suppression turret. You're the gunner. Launch rounds at their spear guns to obscure their vision and clog their gears. See to it that my men all make their drops and the transport stays in one piece.The Ironwall Rampart^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Raise the Barricades, No Rest For The Wicked^Before the Gate of Horror^Defeat Grimkor the Wicked and return to Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^The Ironwall Rampart overlooks the Valley of Fallen Heroes, west of Aldur'thar. The rampart dominates the fields below on all sides. We will not be able to advance if the rampart cannot be taken, but it is held by Grimkor the Wicked and his Cult of the Damned disciples. If you can weaken Grimkor, our forces know what to expect as we advance. Take this rune of distortion. Unleashing its power near Grimkor's orb at the end of the rampart should be enough to get the necromancer's attention.Blinding the Eyes in the Sky^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^^Raise the Barricades^Keeping the Alliance Blind^Use the SGM-3 to destroy 6 Skybreaker Recon Fighters, then report back to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^The Alliance has somehow managed to field a squadron of recon vehicles over the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, the broad areas west of Aldur'thar. They cannot be permitted to take the lead in this fight. Chief Engineer Copperclaw has supplied me with the perfect weapon to deal with this threat -- he calls his new missile the SGM-3. I have his assurances that it will take out the Alliance flying machines in a single hit. Go and use this weapon to give us the upper hand.Get the Message^80^Alliance^Icecrown^High Captain Justin Bartlett^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^^Capture 6 Orgrim's Hammer Dispatches from Orgrim's Hammer Scouts and bring them to High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker.^The Horde is up to something and I don't like it. After the stunt they pulled on the Broken Front, they're capable of anything, and it's up to us to stop it. There's been a flurry of activity in the skies over the Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar and the Ironwall Rampart. Horde scouts and messengers streak in and out on dragonhawks, carrying reports and orders. Take this dart gun and use it to kill the Orgrim's Hammer Scouts. It'll probably work best if you're flying, too.Sneak Preview^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to fly down to the gate of desolation, visiting the south, central, north, and northwest regions of the gate.^Progress is being made. We have a promising array of tactics that should gain us control of the death gate. There will doubtlessly be many casualties, but in the end, we should be able to prevail - barring any interference from those Horde you insist on contending with... At any rate, our next focus will be the gate of desolation. Fly down and become familiar with it and with the enemies posted there. When you return, I will have your missions prepared.The Guardians of Corp'rethar^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Before the Gate of Horror^^Koltira Deathweaver, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to kill 5 Harbingers of Horror and 5 Corp'rethar Guardians.^Corp'rethar, called the Horror Gate. It is the last barrier between us and the Icecrown Citadel. It waits to the south of the Ironwall Rampart, beyond the glacier and the Conflagration. By the time our troops reach it, they will be exhausted and worse. We must weaken its defenses, or our army's strength will break upon its walls. Its battlements are manned by some of the Lich King's fiercest and most zealous servants. Do all you can to destroy these guardians and hope it is enough.Drag and Drop^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect Orbs of Illusion from Bitter Initiates at Aldur'thar and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.^The Cult of the Damned hold the gate of desolation, eh? No surprise there. Time to have a little fun. At the southern end of the gate, you mentioned there were new cultists being trained. They're almost certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion. These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy. Kill the fools until you find one, <class>, then use it on a subjugator.Chain of Command^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to go to Aldur'thar and defeat Overseer Faedris, Overseer Savryn, Overseer Veraj, and Overseer Jhaeqon.^Based on your report, and my knowledge of the Cult, they have an overseer managing the operation of each encampment on the gate. While taking their leaders down will only be a temporary setback, it will at least slow them down and keep them off-balance. And that, <race>, is a worthy enough goal for now. Seek out these overseers and return to me when they have been dispatched.Cannot Reproduce^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Cannot Reproduce^^^Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use the Partitioned Flask at each of the 3 Cultists' Cauldrons at Aldur'thar, then bring it to Chief Engineer Boltwrench.^I smell their cauldrons from here, but that's not plague they're cooking. Pledges to the cult are forced to drink a concoction that steals their will and enslaves them forever to the Lich King. Some say the potion contains the twisted soul of a being who was tormented before being mercilessly slaughtered, but I've never been able to reproduce it... Fill this flask with a sample from each of the three cauldrons in the northwest region of the gate and bring it to Chief Engineer Boltwrench.Retest Now^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Cannot Reproduce^^^Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to throw a Writhing Mass into a cauldron at Aldur'thar.^This should do the trick! Those twisted hooligans are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then I say we help 'em out a bit! Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence once you've defeated them. When you've collected a bunch of them, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls into any of their cauldrons. Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine!Retest Now^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^Chief Engineer Boltwrench^^^^Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to drink the Diluted Cult Tonic, kill any Cultists at Aldur'thar and take their Tainted Essences. You are then to combine 10 of the essences into a Writhing Mass and throw it into any of their cauldrons.^Those twisted cultists are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then let's help 'em out a bit! Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence. Once you've collected a bunch of 'em, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls in one of their cauldrons. Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine!Drag and Drop^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect Orbs of Illusion from Bitter Initiates at Aldur'thar and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.^Looks like those initiates are increasing in number again. You know what to do... At the southern portion of the gate, the new cultists are being trained. They're certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion. These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy. Slay the fools until you find some, then use them on the subjugators there.Shatter the Shards^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Before the Gate of Horror^^Bring the Broken Shard of Horror, the Broken Shard of Despair, and the Broken Shard of Suffering to Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^Atop the battlements of Corp'rethar, the Lich King's minions have erected three crystals, the shards of horror, despair, and suffering. Should our men reach the walls of Corp'rethar, he will unleash these weapons on our army. In full effect, the crystals will afflict the minds of our men with paralyzing pain and fear. Then, the Scourge will be able to slaughter them at will. Find these shards, destroy them, and bring me their broken remains. We cannot allow the Lich King to deploy these weapons!Before the Gate of Horror^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Bloodspattered Banners, The Ironwall Rampart^The Guardians of Corp'rethar, Shatter the Shards^Koltira Deathweaver, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to use the Volatile Acid to dissolve the remains of 6 Skeletal Reavers.^The Conflagration, the ground before Corp'rethar, south of the Ironwall Rampart, is where the Lich King's elite soldiers have formed up to defend the citadel. Led by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the Scourge will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us. I've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers.Blood of the Chosen^80^Horde^Icecrown^Warbringer Davos Rioht^Warbringer Davos Rioht^^Orgrim's Hammer^^Warbringer Davos Rioht on Orgrim's Hammer has sent you to kill 20 vrykul in Ymirheim.^Those vrykul that have gained the favor of the Lich King call themselves the Ymirjar. They inhabit a city in the center of Icecrown. We have a lot of preparations to make before we assault Icecrown Citadel, and the one that stands before us now is routing these so-called "Chosen" of the Lich King. Go to their city, Ymirheim, and slaughter them in their home. Let there be no questions as to who the stronger combatants are here.Keeping the Alliance Blind^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^^Blinding the Eyes in the Sky^^Use the SGM-3 to destroy 6 Skybreaker Recon Fighters, then report back to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^The Alliance is tenacious, I'll give them that, but it'll take more than that to stop us. Take this SGM-3 with you and shoot down the Skybreaker's recon fighters once again. I doubt the message will get through their thick skulls, but there are enough missiles to keep trying to get our point across. Go and find their fighters flying above the Valley of Fallen Heroes, west of Aldur'thar, and don't come back until you've made wreckage of them.Raise the Barricades^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to construct 8 Barricades using your Barricade Construction Kit.^When our forces begin to move beyond Aldur'thar, they will be vulnerable to attack from the Ironwall Rampart and the broad glacier below. We have neither the time nor the materials to build fortifications, but we can put up some barricades to shield our men from fire and break up Scourge charges. Take this barricade kit to the Valley of Fallen Heroes, on the west side of Aldur'thar. Locate the markers I've placed there and use this kit to construct your barricades there.Capture More Dispatches^80^Alliance^Icecrown^High Captain Justin Bartlett^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^^Capture 6 Orgrim's Hammer Dispatches from Orgrim's Hammer Scouts and bring them to High Captain Justin Bartlett aboard the Skybreaker.^Despite our efforts, the Horde continues to send scouts to the area of the Icecrown Glacier, to the west of the Ironwall Rampart and Aldur'thar. We can't afford to let the Horde gain the upper hand with this scouting operation. Take the dart gun with you again and show the Orgrim's Hammer scouts no mercy! Bring the captured dispatches to me. The Horde's wasted efforts will be our gain.Bloodspattered Banners^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to kill 5 Scourge Banner-Bearers, 5 Scourge Converters, and 20 Converted Heroes.^In the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar, the Scourge seeks to use the fallen against us.

Led by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the Scourge will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us.

Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers.Blood of the Chosen^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Knight-Captain Drosche^Knight-Captain Drosche^^^^Knight-Captain Drosche on the Skybreaker has sent you to kill 20 vrykul in Ymirheim.^Those vrykul that have gained the favor of the Lich King call themselves the Ymirjar. They inhabit a city in the center of Icecrown. We have a lot of preparations to make before we assault Icecrown Citadel, and the one that stands before us now is routing these so-called "Chosen" of the Lich King. Go to their city, Ymirheim, and slaughter them in their home. Let there be no questions as to who the stronger combatants are here.The Ironwall Rampart^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Defeat Grimkor the Wicked and return to Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker.^The Ironwall Rampart overlooks the Valley of Fallen Heroes, west of Aldur'thar. The rampart dominates the fields below on all sides. We will not be able to advance if the rampart cannot be taken, but it is held by Grimkor the Wicked and his Cult of the Damned disciples. If you can weaken Grimkor, our forces will know what to expect as we advance. Take this rune of distortion. Unleashing its power near Grimkor's orb at the end of the rampart should be enough to get the necromancer's attention.The Guardians of Corp'rethar^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to kill 5 Harbingers of Horror and 5 Corp'rethar Guardians.^Corp'rethar, called the Horror Gate.

Any warrior with half a brain can tell you that vrykul are fierce fighters and should not be taken lightly. That goes two-fold for the Ymirjar. They have shown us no restraint in proving why the Lich King deemed them worthy. Ground Commander Xutjja is overseeing the assault. The city itself is located in the center of Icecrown - Xutjja's troops are positioned near the edge of the glacier, north of the city.Joining the Assault^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Knight-Captain Drosche^Ground Commander Koup^^^^Report to Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim.^We need more men to join the main assault on Ymirheim. Any warrior with half a brain can tell you that vrykul are fierce fighters and should not be taken lightly. That goes two-fold for the Ymirjar. They have shown no restraint in proving to us why the Lich King deemed them worthy. Ground Commander Koup is overseeing the assault.

Relax, it's not a bug exactly, but it'll serve our purposes. In the northern portion of Aldur'thar the cult's void summoners enslave demonic minions. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of these enslaved minions, and then use their summoning crystal to bring our little spy into being. Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy.Mystery of the Infinite, Redux^80^All^Dragonblight^Chromie^Chromie^^Mystery of the Infinite^^Chromie, at the top of Wyrmrest Temple, has asked you to travel once more to the Bronze Dragonshrine.^There you are! Or, were we just talking? <Chromie muses over the temporal possibilities.> Anyway, the Infinites are after you! Well, not you per-se. Rather, they're after the past version of you that defended the Hourglass of Eternity. You remember, right? That was you back then, except it's you now too. Wait, that's not important. What is important is that you head back to the Bronze Dragonshrine and defend yourself and the hourglass from their attacks before you get erased from history!Not a Bug^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect 5 Dark Matters and summon a Dark Messenger at Aldur'thar.^The cultists have discovered the last messenger you summoned, <race>. While it was quite informative, it's important that we continue to monitor their every move. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of enslaved minions at Aldur'thar. Then use their summoning crystal to bring another dark messenger into being. Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy.Need More Info^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^Need More Info^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the Cult Researchers at Aldur'thar and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis.^The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time.... Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it! I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details.No Rest For The Wicked^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^Need More Info^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to defeat Alumeth the Ascended at Aldur'thar.^These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans! The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul. If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary. Combine his heart, skull, scepter and robes from around their chamber and use his remains on the crystal there. Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful!Reborn From The Ashes^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^Alexstrasza the Life-Binder^King Varian Wrynn^Reborn From The Ashes^^^Gather Fordragon's Shield from the field of battle at Angrathar the Wrath Gate and return it to King Varian Wrynn at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind City.^Our fate is emblazoned upon our souls at birth. Bolvar's fall, while tragic, was unavoidable. All that you can do now is honor your hero, <name>. Collect Bolvar's shield from the field of battle and return it to your king. When you present the shield to Varian, tell him this: "All is not lost. From the ashes of the fallen will rise a force that will unite nations and purge the evil from this world." He mustn't lose faith. Go now, <name>. Your people need a hero. They need you.Futility^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Koltira Deathweaver^Do Your Worst^^^Return to Koltira Deathweaver aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^Do you see now? Sending your men against the prince's armies just swells their numbers. I don't expect you to understand... you'll probably just end up like the others. You'd best return to whoever sent you.

Let's not give the Scourge forces any respite. Sindragosa's Fall lies east just beyond the Valley of Lost Hope. The Cult of the Damned operate there, under close supervision of the Lich King's undead vrykul lackeys. It is a place of great power, possibly a blue dragonflight graveyard. The feared frostbrood are raised there from the bones of blue dragons. An attack there would have great impact on the enemy's access to frost wyrms. Are you up to it, <name>?No Rest For The Wicked^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Thassarian^^^^Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to defeat Alumeth the Ascended at Aldur'thar.^It's Alumeth... He's growing in power again. I can sense it. Again his underlings are channeling power to his soul. If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary. Return to his chamber in the north portion of Aldur'thar. Combine his heart, skull, scepter and robes, then use his remains on the crystal there. Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful!Sneak Preview^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^That's Abominable!^Drag and Drop, Chain of Command, Cannot Reproduce^Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to fly down to the gate of desolation, visiting the south, central, north, and northwest regions of the gate.^Progress is being made. We have a promising array of tactics that should gain us control of the death gate. There will doubtlessly be many casualties, but in the end, we should be able to prevail - barring any interference from the Alliance. Our next focus will be Aldur'thar, the gate of desolation. Fly down and become familiar with it and with the enemies posted there. When you return, I will have your missions prepared.Drag and Drop^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Sneak Preview^Drag and Drop, Not a Bug, Need More Info^Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect Orbs of Illusion from Bitter Initiates at Aldur'thar and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.^The Cult of the Damned hold the gate of desolation, eh? No surprise there. Time to have a little fun. At the southern end of the gate, you mentioned there were new cultists being trained. They're almost certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion. These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy. Kill the fools until you find one, <class>, then use it on a subjugator.Drag and Drop^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Drag and Drop^^Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect Orbs of Illusion from Bitter Initiates at Aldur'thar and use them on 3 Dark Subjugators there.^Looks like those initiates are increasing in number again.

While taking their leaders down will only be a temporary setback, it will at least slow them down and keep them off-balance. And that, <race>, is a worthy enough goal for now. Seek out these overseers and return to me when they have been dispatched.Cannot Reproduce^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Cannot Reproduce^Sneak Preview^^Koltira aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to use the Partitioned Flask at each of the 3 Cultists' Cauldrons at Aldur'thar, then bring it to Chief Engineer Copperclaw.^I smell their cauldrons from here, but that's not plague they're cooking. Pledges to the cult are forced to drink a concoction that steals their will and enslaves them forever to the Lich King. Some say the potion contains the twisted soul of a being who was tormented before being mercilessly slaughtered, but I've never been able to reproduce it... Fill this flask with a sample from each of the three cauldrons in the northwest region of the gate and bring it to Chief Engineer Copperclaw.Retest Now^80^Horde^Icecrown^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Chief Engineer Copperclaw^Cannot Reproduce^^Retest Now^Chief Engineer Copperclaw aboard Orgrim's Hammer wants you to throw a Writhing Mass into a cauldron at Aldur'thar.^This should do the trick! Those twisted hooligans are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then I say we help 'em out a bit! Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... Its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence once you've defeated them. When you've collected a bunch of essences, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls into any of their cauldrons.

Relax, it's not a bug exactly, but it'll serve our purposes. In the northern portion of Aldur'thar, the cult's void summoners enslave demonic minions. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of these enslaved minions, and then use the cultists' summoning crystal to bring our little spy into being. Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy.Where Dragons Fell^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^^Cradle of the Frostbrood^Time for Answers^Matthias Lehner at Sindragosa's Fall wants you to obtain 6 Whelp Bone Dusts.^A whole brood of blue dragons fell here.

You're the only one who can see me because you touched something that once belonged to him... don't you remember? You don't know what it is? Well I can't just tell you... that would make him really mad. He's not just a prince anymore... he's the king!

You'll see what happened.Knowledge is a Terrible Burden^80^Horde^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Koltira Deathweaver^Time for Answers^^Argent Aid^Report back to Koltira aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^Now you know what you're up against, <name>.

He will not leave it unguarded again.Argent Aid^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Argent Aid^Knowledge is a Terrible Burden^^Speak to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Crusader's Pinnacle.^There were rumors about the events you speak of among the death knights. I always expected the story to be more... symbolic. We must warn others, but we must be discreet. As soon as the Lich King knows we're making our move, he'll move the location of the heart -- we'll never get a chance like this again. The Horde and the Alliance have been infiltrated by the Cult of the Damned before. The Ebon Blade operates too close to the Scourge. We have to speak to Tirion Fordring and his Argent Crusade.Tirion's Gambit^80^Horde^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Argent Aid^^^Tirion Fordring, at the Crusader's Pinnacle, wants you to obtain and wear a Cultist Acolyte's Hood and meet him at the entrance of the Cathedral of Darkness, northwest of Icecrown Citadel.^Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact. And now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart... a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity. This is a sign of the Light. As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again! Meet me at the cathedral's entrance. Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito.Not a Bug^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^^Not a Bug^^Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect 5 Dark Matters and summon a Dark Messenger at Aldur'thar.^The cultists have discovered the last messenger you summoned, <race>. While it was quite informative, it's important that we continue to monitor the cult's every move. Use this rod to siphon the dark matter from the corpses of enslaved minions at Aldur'thar. Then use their summoning crystal to bring another dark messenger into being. Until it is discovered, the messenger will serve as our eyes and ears, discreetly observing the actions of our enemy.Need More Info^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^Need More Info^Drag and Drop^Raise the Barricades^Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to collect the 3 pages of Cultists' Research from the Cult Researchers at Aldur'thar and use them to create the Cult of the Damned Thesis.^The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time.... Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it! I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details.No Rest For The Wicked^80^Horde^Icecrown^Koltira Deathweaver^Koltira Deathweaver^Need More Info^^The Ironwall Rampart, No Rest For The Wicked^Koltira, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to slay Alumeth the Ascended at Aldur'thar.^These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans! The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul.

The Horde is saddened by the loss of such a great hero, but the Horde was not responsible for the cowardly attacks made by Putress at the Wrath Gate. We have also lost mighty heroes because of this betrayal. Tell your king that we will do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators of this cowardly act to justice. We will do all that we can to avoid conflict with the Alliance, but we will not hesitate to defend ourselves if provoked.The Killing Time^74^Alliance^Dragonblight^King Varian Wrynn^Broll Bearmantle^Reborn From The Ashes^^^Use the Portal to the Undercity inside Stormwind Keep to teleport to the Undercity.

What's more, we installed infra-green in specially constructed bombers... but not to hide them, no! We use infra-green tech to shield them! Speak with Karen No and request a bomber.

They call it infra-green, and I'll be a one-eyed ogre if those psychos didn't strike green gold. Go find Kibli Killohertz. He's leading the reverse engineering efforts of infra-green, at a small, hidden Alliance airport above Aldur'thar, the Desolation Gate. I'll give you infra-green vision to help you find it.

If you're up for a challenge, that is. We've been tipped off about an opening below Icecrown Citadel. Our engineers have studied the layout and have decided it's a structural weakness. We've sent some men there along with some "borrowed" saronite bombs. They're under Captain Kendall's command. With a little help we could deal a huge blow to the forces of the Scourge.

As you touch it, your hand reels in horrible pain. You feel as if your hand has been cut, yet there is no visible wound. As you collect your thoughts, you hear a young boy's voice nearby. "You really shouldn't have done that."Time to Hide^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Exploiting an Opening^^^Matthias Lehner wants you to obtain 3 Faceless One's Blood.^You shouldn't have touched it.

Let's not celebrate just yet. We need to capitalize on the momentum we've gathered with our little bombing mission. We've spotted a workable Horde demolisher-class catapult in the field below. The geist seem to be taking it apart. If you can put it back together, we'll be able to do some serious damage to the Scourge's armies in the Valley. Sure, you'll be a little outnumbered, but I've a lot of faith in you!Do Your Worst^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Do Your Worst^Field Repairs^^Use the Refurbished Demolisher to destroy 150 Decomposed Ghouls, 20 Frostskull Mages and 2 Bone Giants in the Valley of Lost Hope. Speak to Matthias Lehner at the First Legion Forward Camp when you've completed this task.^You're going to use this machine against the Scourge? You're not going to win against them like that. You can destroy hundreds... even thousands of them. But you won't win. Not out here. When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north. There is an old army encampment. What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against.Army of the Damned^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Do Your Worst^^^Matthias Lehner at the First Legion Forward Camp wants you to raise an army of 100 Ghoulish Minions.^You probably think you're quite strong -- fighting these undead and crushing their bones beneath your war machines. That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them. I saw the prince do it himself. I can show you how it happened... if you'd like.Futility^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Thassarian^Do Your Worst^^^Return to Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker.^Do you see now?

See, when I give one of these other soldiers an assignment, the odds of them getting it done are about fifty-fifty. The odds of them coming back... well, slightly worse. But with you, it's always a guaranteed thing. Like gnomish clockwork! Anyway, I have another one for you. Sindragosa's Fall, east of the valley. There is some serious cultist activity, including and not limited to, the raising of frost wyrms. I need you to go kick their teeth in. I hate cultists.Where Dragons Fell^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Matthias Lehner^Where Dragons Fell^Sindragosa's Fall^^Matthias Lehner at Sindragosa's Fall wants you to obtain 6 Whelp Bone Dusts.^A whole brood of blue dragons fell here.

You'll see what happened.Knowledge is a Terrible Burden^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Matthias Lehner^Thassarian^Where Dragons Fell^^^Report back to Thassarian aboard the Skybreaker.^Now you know what you're up against, <name>. An opponent who no longer knows pain... remorse... or humanity. An opponent who will do anything to get what he wants. The heart was his weakness and now he knows you've found it.

He will not leave it unguarded again.Tirion's Help^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Thassarian^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Where Dragons Fell^^^Speak to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Crusader's Pinnacle.^It's not the first time I've heard that story about Arthas and his heart... always thought it was some made-up tale to impress the rank and file. We must act on this information immediately. Unfortunately, we must do so in secret. Arthas's agents are everywhere and if he finds out, our plan is dead in the water. We need to take this to the Argent Crusade. Every single paladin in that order was hand-picked by Tirion himself. If there's anyone free of cultist infiltration, it's those guys.Tirion's Gambit^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Highlord Tirion Fordring^Where Dragons Fell^^^Tirion Fordring, at the Crusader's Pinnacle, wants you to obtain and wear a Cultist Acolyte's Hood and meet him at the entrance of the Cathedral of Darkness, northwest of Icecrown Citadel.^Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact. And now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart... a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity. This is a sign of the Light. As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again! Meet me at the cathedral's entrance. Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito.Static Shock Troops: the Bombardment^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Kibli Killohertz^Kibli Killohertz^^^^Kibli Killohertz wants you to kill 50 Bombardment Infantry, 10 Bombardment Captains and 20 Gargoyle Ambushers.^This is a short-ranged mission, over The Bombardment.

We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them. To do that, we need forward staging areas. Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel. We want you to help secure these forts. Capture each fort, and then report back to me. May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, <name>, for you will no doubt clash with Horde forces eager to gain these same fortifications.Hellfire Fortifications^60^Horde^Hellfire Peninsula^Battlecryer Blackeye^Battlecryer Blackeye^^Felspark Ravine^Hellfire Fortifications^Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Battlecryer Blackeye in Thrallmar.^The fel orcs of Hellfire Citadel must be scoured from our birthland! To attack them, we must first secure forward staging points near the Citadel. Our outrunners found three fortifications that will suit this purpose, but the Alliance has the same idea and even now sends forces to take them! We want you to stop the Alliance and capture these forts. Aid in the capture of each fort and then return to me. For the Horde!Hellfire Fortifications^60^Alliance^Death Knight^Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell^Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell^^Expedition Point^Hellfire Fortifications^Capture the Overlook, the Stadium and Broken Hill, then return to Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell in Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.^The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces.

For the Horde!Corastrasza^80^All^Borean Tundra^Librarian Serrah^Corastrasza^Corastrasza^^^Librarian Serrah wants you to speak to Corastrasza in Coldarra.^Greetings, <class>. Might I impose on you for a favor? Corastrasza is the sister of Raelorasz - the red dragon in charge of our outpost here. Against his will, she has ascended to one of the upper rings of the Nexus to observe some frighteningly powerful blue drakes. Though he will never say it, he worries about her, and would welcome any news of her well-being. Please seek her out. Ask her to put her pride aside and send word to her brother.Aces High!^80^All^Borean Tundra^Corastrasza^Corastrasza^Corastrasza^^Aces High!^Corastrasza on the upper ring of the Nexus in Coldarra wants you to ride her drake and kill 5 Scalesworn Elites.^You possess the courage to draw so near to Malygos' lair, mortal? Or is it simply ignorance? Soon we shall know.... I am a seasoned trainer of the graceful drakes of the red dragonflight. My business here is to study the enemy and teach my precious pets the tactics that will be most effective when we face the master of the blues. To demonstrate your nerve and ability, I will allow you to ride one of my drakes against the enemy's minions. The opportunity is yours for the asking...Aces High!^80^All^Borean Tundra^Corastrasza^Corastrasza^^Aces High!^^Corastrasza on the upper ring of the Nexus in Coldarra wants you to ride her drake and kill 5 Scalesworn Elites.^Again we meet, <race>.

As always, my pets stand ready to bring fiery destruction to the enemy. Speak, and they shall be at your disposal.The Library Console^80^Alliance^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Inventor's Library Console^Sniffing Out the Perpetrator^^^Take the Inventor's Disk to the Inventor's Library Console inside the Inventor's Library.^Norgannon's shell is within our reach, <name>. Take the inventor's disk into the library's interior. There should be a console there that you can activate with the disk. I imagine Mimir stored more there than just Norgannon's shell. There are probably enough schematics stored there to keep Ironforge's engineers occupied for years! Anyway, use the disk to recover the shell. Hopefully, Mimir hasn't decided to put any more obstacles in our way.The Library Console^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Brann Bronzebeard^Inventor's Library Console^Catching up with Brann^^^Take the Inventor's Disk to the Inventor's Library Console inside the Inventor's Library.^Norgannon's shell is within our reach, <name>. Take the inventor's disk into the library's interior. There should be a console there that you can activate with the disk. I imagine Mimir stored more there than just Norgannon's shell. There are probably enough schematics stored there to keep Ironforge's engineers occupied for years! Anyway, bring the disk to the console. Hopefully, Mimir hasn't decided to put any more obstacles in our way.Preparations for War^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Officer Van Rossem^High Captain Justin Bartlett^^^^Speak to Officer Van Rossem to secure passage to the Skybreaker in Icecrown, and then report to High Captain Justin Bartlett.^You there! You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown. You may have heard rumors of our failure in assaulting the glacier from the ground, but let me set those concerns to rest. We're now mounting our assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth, the Skybreaker. The Horde don't stand a chance, and neither does Arthas. Speak to me when you're ready to depart.Preparations for War^80^Horde^Icecrown^Sky-Reaver Klum^Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar^^^^Speak to Sky-Reaver Klum to secure passage to Orgrim's Hammer in Icecrown, and then report to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar.^You there! You look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown. The Alliance scum rushed into Icecrown ahead of us, unprepared, and got just what they deserved for their impatience. We took our time, we made ready, and soon we will mount a true assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth - Orgrim's Hammer. The Alliance don't stand a chance, and neither does Arthas. Speak to me when you're ready to depart and lend a hand.Everfrost^77^All^The Storm Peaks^Everfrost Chip^Calder^^^Remember Everfrost!^You are to return to Dun Niffelem and ask Calder about the piece of Everfrost.^This piece of ice has been submitted to immense pressures and exposed to natural magics from deep beneath the world's surface. In combination, these effects have yielded an ice that will never melt. Knowing little of these things, you resolve to bring the sample back to Dun Niffelem. Someone there is bound to be familiar with its properties.Maintaining Discipline^79^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretta the Arbiter^Gretta the Arbiter^^The Drakkensryd^^Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to use the Disciplining Rod on 6 Exhausted Vrykul inside the Forlorn Mine.^You've succeeded where others have failed.

But do not let your guard down -- every new challenger with delusions of grandeur is going to come out swinging for your title of Hyldskvinnar. Show these upstarts what you're made of.Back to the Pit^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretta the Arbiter^Gretta the Arbiter^^Into the Pit^^Gretta the Arbiter, in Brunnhildar Village, wants you to use the Reins of the Warbear Matriarch inside the Pit of the Fang and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears.^To truly stay in your best riding shape you'll want to test yourself against the other Hyldnir every day. Head back into the Pit of the Fang and show them what you're capable of. They'll appreciate suffering defeat to one as skilled as yourself.The Aberrations Must Die^80^All^The Storm Peaks^Gretta the Arbiter^Gretta the Arbiter^^Aberrations^^Gretta the Arbiter in Brunnhildar Village wants you to go to Valkyrion and obtain Vials of Frost Oil from the Valkyrion Aspirants. Use the Vials of Frost Oil to destroy 30 Plagued Proto-Drake Eggs.^It is not enough to demonstrate your prowess among your peers. You must also fight our enemies, dear sister. The Valkyrion traitors continue to mock our noble drake-riding traditions by rearing plagued proto-drakes. Seize the frost oil they wield and use it to freeze their abominable plagued eggs.Xarantaur, the Witness^80^Horde^The Storm Peaks^Boktar Bloodfury^Xarantaur^Xarantaur, the Witness^^^Speak with Xarantaur at Camp Tunka'lo.^It seems we're not the only visitors to this area. A courier relayed a message from a tauren named Xarantaur, who said he was visiting a taunka village called Camp Tunka'lo. The note was somewhat cryptic, but it seems this Xarantaur has come to Storm Peaks to learn the history of a taunka legend. Meet up with him, <name>. See if what he knows can help us in any way. From his description, Camp Tunka'lo is far to the east, beyond the Terrace of the Makers and north of Dun Niffelem.Trial of the Naaru: Magtheridon^70^All^Magtheridon's Lair^A'dal^A'dal^^Trial of the Naaru: Mercy, Trial of the Naaru: Strength, Trial of the Naaru: Tenacity^^A'dal in Shattrath City wants you to slay Magtheridon.^Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru. Only one obstacle remains, mortal. Gather an army and travel to the lair of Magtheridon, deep inside Hellfire Citadel. Battle your way to the heart of the chamber and destroy the foul corrupter!The Cudgel of Kar'desh^70^All^The Slave Pens^Skar'this the Heretic^Skar'this the Heretic^^^^Skar'this the Heretic in the heroic Slave Pens of Coilfang Reservoir wants you to bring him the Earthen Signet and the Blazing Signet.^Bring me the elemental signets that the cudgel requires! The earthen signet is held by Gruul the Dragonkiller. Gruul can be found inside his lair in the Blade's Edge Mountains. The second signet is the blazing heart of a creature known as Nightbane. This mythical beast is said to reside in the hallowed halls of the prophet, Medivh. Make haste!The Vials of Eternity^70^All^Caverns of Time^Soridormi^Soridormi^^^^Soridormi at Caverns of Time wants you to retrieve Vashj's Vial Remnant from Lady Vashj at Coilfang Reservoir and Kael's Vial Remnant from Kael'thas Sunstrider at Tempest Keep.^Seven vials were drawn from the Well of Eternity by Illidan. He poured three into the lake on top of Mount Hyjal and a second Well of Eternity was created. For years the rest were believed lost. With the opening of the Dark Portal, we've come to know that he gave one each to his lieutenants Kael'thas and Vashj. Retrieve what remains of them; we will need them as foci to open a gateway to any events tied to Mount Hyjal, recent or ancient. The outcome of the Battle of Mount Hyjal must be preserved.Let's Get Out of Here!^80^Horde^Icecrown^Father Kamaros^Brother Keltan^^Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton^^Escort Father Kamaros to safety and then report to Brother Keltan aboard Orgrim's Hammer.^The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape. I cannot make it on my own, <class>, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again. Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off?Let's Get Out of Here^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Father Kamaros^Absalan the Pious^^Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton^^Escort Father Kamaros to safety and then report to Absalan the Pious aboard the Skybreaker.^The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape. I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again. Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off?Southern Sabotage^80^All^Wintergrasp^Tactical Officer Ahbramis^Tactical Officer Ahbramis^^^^Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower or Winter's Edge Tower and return to Tactical Officer Ahbramis in Wintergrasp.^The three towers south of the Wintergrasp river are draining power from the Fortress! Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower or Winter's Edge Tower, then return to me. Remember, only siege vehicles can damage a tower, so make sure to protect them from the Horde!Toppling the Towers^80^All^Wintergrasp^Tactical Officer Kilrath^Tactical Officer Kilrath^^^^Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower, or Winter's Edge Tower and return to Tactical Officer Kilrath in Wintergrasp.^While the Alliance may be pounding on our doors, a true tactician looks beyond the obvious. "Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected." <name>, I need you to travel across the Wintergrasp River and destroy one of the three towers to the south. Our Warlocks report that the towers are draining power we could use to bolster our own troops. Return to me once you've destroyed a tower.Tails Up^77^All^Zul'Drak^Chronicler To'kini^Chronicler To'kini^^Relics of the Snow Leopard Goddess^^Chronicler To'kini at Zim'Torga wants you to use To'kini's Blowgun on Frost Leopards and Icepaw Bears. Return to him with 3 females of each.^Along with the Drakkari artifacts, I'm interested in returning to Zandalar with some of the Zul'Drak wildlife. I have males of both the frost leopards and icepaw bears, but I need females! Too bad that my trapper was killed in a most unfortunate accident. Perhaps you would be willing to fill in for him? Put the leopards and bears to sleep with this blowgun then lift their tails and return with some females if you would be so kind. They can be found near the Altars of Rhunok, Quetz'lun, and Har'koa.Eggs for Dubra'Jin^77^All^Zul'Drak^Ha'wana^Ha'wana^^^^Ha'wana at Dubra'Jin needs you to collect 12 Gundrak Raptor Eggs.^How ya doin', mon? Thinkin' ya might be helpin' me out? Bah'Kini be needin' lots o' the raptor eggs to be sacrificin' to Dubra'Jin. How ya thinkin' we not be overrun yet by the Drakkari? Dubra'Jin be lendin' us his aid! We need ya to gather up the raptor eggs from around the trees outside here in Gundrak. Sometimes the raptors carry 'em to keep 'em warm, too.A Valiant's Field Training^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Sir Marcus Barlowe^Sir Marcus Barlowe^^^^Sir Marcus Barlowe at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to kill 10 Converted Heroes.^The tournament is a time for testing your skills against your peers, but we must not forget that the real enemy, the Scourge, will not wait. As you hone your skills against others, so should you maintain your edge in combat against the enemy. Travel to the area southwest of the Valley of Fallen Heroes and north of Corp'rethar. There, the Scourge raises dead heroes and turns them against us. Defeat these minions of the Scourge, do honor to our allies, and keep yourself prepared for combat.Valiant Of Stormwind^80^Dwarf, Night Elf,^Argent Tournament^Marshal Jacob Alerius^Marshal Jacob Alerius^Valiant Of Stormwind^^The Valiant's Charge^Speak with Marshal Jacob Alerius again if you wish to become a valiant of Stormwind.^Welcome, champion. Word of your combat prowess has already reached my ears. Do you seek to join Stormwind's tournament delegation? You will train and rise through the ranks as you have before, but when you are named a champion of Stormwind, your squire will have the option of carrying our banner into battle.A Worthy Weapon^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Marshal Jacob Alerius^Marshal Jacob Alerius^^^^Bring the Blade of Drak'Mar to Marshal Jacob Alerius at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Of all the times to have such rotten luck! My tournament blade has gone missing and I need it for a match this afternoon. One of the bards tells me that travelers used to present winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to Drak'Mar lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near its border with Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills.A Blade Fit For A Champion^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Marshal Jacob Alerius^Marshal Jacob Alerius^^^^Retrieve the Ashwood Brand and bring it to Marshal Jacob Alerius at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Good, honest, honed steel may not carry the day. The other combatants are using enchanted blades and I find myself at a disadvantage, but all is not lost. There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded. She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given. Apply this balm before kissing anything, <name>. Otherwise, you'll catch warts.Archivum Data Disc^80^All^Ulduar^Archivum Data Disc^Archivum Console^^^The Celestial Planetarium^Bring the Archivum Data Disc to the Archivum Console in Ulduar.^This platinum disc is surprisingly symmetrical and devoid of any scratches or imperfections. Engraved along its edge, bold runes spell out the word "ARCHIVUM." There must be a device inside Ulduar capable of reading the disc.Freya's Sigil^80^All^Ulduar^Prospector Doren^Prospector Doren^^The Celestial Planetarium^Algalon^Prospector Doren at the Archivum in Ulduar wants you to obtain Freya's Sigil.^Freya's Sigil is going to be one of the tougher ones, I reckon. According to the Archivum, the essence of the Sigil is tied to her three elder servants, Brightleaf, Ironbranch and Stonebark. Should any of the elders be harmed, the Sigil's integrity will be compromised. Sparing the elders, however, means that Freya will be more powerful when you face her. What can I say, <name>. We're stuck between a rock and hard place.The Celestial Planetarium^80^All^Ulduar^Prospector Doren^Prospector Doren^^Archivum Data Disc^Freya's Sigil, Hodir's Sigil, Thorim's Sigil, Mimiron's Sigil^Prospector Doren at the Archivum in Ulduar wants you to locate the entrance to the Celestial Planetarium.^Listen, <lad/lass>! Azeroth's fate is at stake here. Our only chance is to get to the Celestial Planetarium in time to find this Algalon and stop him from beaming back any messages to his Titan masters. Locate the Celestial Planetarium and come back with any information you get. We might still have some time to prepare for Algalon's arrival.Hodir's Sigil^80^All^Ulduar^Prospector Doren^Prospector Doren^^The Celestial Planetarium^Algalon^Prospector Doren at the Archivum in Ulduar wants you to obtain Hodir's Sigil.^Hodir's Sigil won't be easy to obtain. Not only are ye going to have to defeat Hodir himself, but yer going to have to do it before he destroys the chest that contains it! Check the Archivum console if you need more information. That thing contains more knowledge than all of the world's libraries put together!Thorim's Sigil^80^All^Ulduar^Prospector Doren^Prospector Doren^^The Celestial Planetarium^Algalon^Prospector Doren at the Archivum in Ulduar wants you to obtain Thorim's Sigil.^Thorim's not himself, <name>. He's come under a dark influence. An evil presence under the guise of an illusion pretends to be his lost wife, Sif. Ye can't let him be overcome by this impostor's spell. If he does, the location of his sigil might forever be lost! Yer going to have to beat some sense into him and yer going to have to do it quick. As always, the Archivum Console will give ye all the gory details... even the ones ye don't like.Mimiron's Sigil^80^All^Ulduar^Prospector Doren^Prospector Doren^^The Celestial Planetarium^Algalon^Prospector Doren at the Ulduar Archivum wants you to obtain Mimiron's Sigil.^Mimiron's a clever one. His entire abode is rigged with some sort of self-destruction mechanism. Unfortunately yer gonna have to race against it if ye want to get his sigil. Check the Archivum Console for more details if ye need them.Algalon^80^All^Ulduar^Prospector Doren^Archivum Console^^Freya's Sigil, Hodir's Sigil, Thorim's Sigil, Mimiron's Sigil^All Is Well That Ends Well^Bring the Sigils of the Watchers to the Archivum Console in Ulduar.^You really did it, <name>. Take the sigils to the Archivum Console and see if you can gain access to the Celestial Planetarium. You best hurry, <lad/lass>. Time is of the essence.The Edge Of Winter^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Marshal Jacob Alerius^Marshal Jacob Alerius^^^^Marshal Jacob Alerius at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to bring him Winter's Edge.^Curse that death knight for breaking my sword! In southern Crystalsong Forest, overlooking the Crystal Vice's exit, you will find Lord Everblaze. Kill him and take the everburning ember from his corpse. Bring it to the center of Winter's Breath Lake in northern Howling Fjord, and use it to free the maiden encased in ice. She is the guardian of an ancient sword and will award it to whoever frees her. Prove your worth and earn the weapon that she has guarded for so long, <name>.Learning The Reins^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Scout Shalyndria^Scout Shalyndria^^^^Strike a Melee Target with Thrust 5 times, use Shield-Breaker on 2 vulnerable Ranged Targets, use Charge on 2 vulnerable Charge Targets and then return to Scout Shalyndria at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Most of the tournament's competitions require competitors to master the command of a mount in battle. In order to familiarize you with mounted combat, we've put up training dummies all over the northern part of the tournament grounds. Visit the stables outside the pavilion, equip your lance, and mount up on the Quel'dorei steed. Familiarize yourself with the tactics available to you and use them to defeat the three different kinds of training dummies.Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings^80^All^Ulduar^Archivum Console^Archivum Console^Ancient History^^^Throw the Shattered Pieces of Val'anyr into Yogg-Saron's maw while he's casting Deafening Roar and defeat Yogg-Saron and recover the Reforged Hammer of Ancient Kings.^The Archivum Console has hinted at a possible way to rebind the fragments of Val'anyr: you must get the fragments inside the physical form of the being known as Yogg-Saron. It sounds like a long shot, but for an artifact of such power you think the risk might just be worth it.All Is Well That Ends Well^80^All^Ulduar^Reply-Code Alpha^Rhonin^^Algalon^^Take the Reply-Code Alpha to Rhonin in Dalaran.^We'd best hurry now, <name>. We're going to have to transmit the reply-code from Dalaran. Take it to Rhonin, I will meet you there.The Black Knight of Westfall?^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^The Black Knight of Westfall?^^The Seer's Crystal^Investigate the Black Knight's claims and return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds with your findings.^No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end. Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background. He claims to be descended from the Cooper family of Westfall. Would you visit their residence in the western part of Moonbrook in Westfall? See if you can find any proof of his story.The Black Knight of Silverpine?^80^Horde^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^The Black Knight of Silverpine?^^The Seer's Crystal^Investigate the Black Knight's claims and return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds with your findings.^No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end. Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background. He claims to hail from Valgan's Field in Silverpine Forest. It's a small farm on the western shore of Lordamere Lake. Would you visit the farm and let me know if there's any truth to his story?The Seer's Crystal^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^The Black Knight of Westfall?^^The Stories Dead Men Tell^Bring a Seer's Crystal to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Now that we know there's no truth to the Black Knight's stories, we must find a way to connect him to the murdered knights. I know a way to reveal the truth about how they died, but it requires a rare material. We must gain a seer's crystal, found only among the unbound seers who congregate near night elf ruins in the Forlorn Woods in the central part of Crystalsong Forest. Find one of these seers, <name>, and bring me the crystal it holds.The Stories Dead Men Tell^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^The Stories Dead Men Tell^The Seer's Crystal^^Use the Seer's Crystal at the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip to determine how they died, then return to Crusader Rhydalla.^The crystal will reveal the truth about how three of the tournament's combatants died. Take it with you to the graveyard east of the Tournament Grounds and use it before the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip. If indeed these men were murdered, then we must find a way to tie it to the Black Knight before he strikes again. Look closely at what the crystal tells you, <name>, for we must be certain these deaths were not accidental.There's Something About the Squire^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^The Stories Dead Men Tell^^^Obtain a Large Femur from a Skeletal Woodcutter and use it to incapacitate Maloric. Search Maloric for evidence, then report back to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Every day, the Black Knight's squire, Maloric, makes a big show of heading to Crystalsong Forest with his axe over his shoulder. He wants us to believe he's chopping wood, but he never returns with more than a few twigs. He usually goes toward the ruins southwest of the Mirror of Twilight. He spends a lot of time out there, even for a squire with responsibilities to his knight. Find a way to distract or incapacitate him and search him. If he's up to something, we'll know it.The Black Knight's Orders^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^The Stories Dead Men Tell^^^Use the Enchanted Bridle to gain control of the Black Knight's Gryphon and ride it to its destination. Once you have arrived, recover the Stolen Tournament Invitation and the Black Knight's Orders and bring them to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^We must discover who sent the Black Knight to the tournament and what his master hopes to gain by killing the competitors. The Kirin Tor has offered to help in this matter and provided us with something to help our search. Take this enchanted bridle to the Black Knight's camp on the eastern edge of the tournament grounds and use it to gain control over the Black Knight's gryphon. The bridle's magic will force the gryphon to take you to his master's home. Search it and return with anything you find.The Black Knight's Fall^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^^^The Black Knight's Curse^Defeat the Black Knight and then speak to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^We must put an end to the Black Knight's scheming, and show those who oppose us that we will not stand by and allow our champions to be murdered. By now, he will suspect that someone is on his trail. Challenge him in the light of day, where he cannot refuse or murder in the dark, <name>. Use my argent charger for the battle. It's housed in the stables. Speak to Squire Cavin at the Ring of Champions. The squire will call the Black Knight to battle, but you will make him answer for his crimes.The Grand Melee^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Captain Joseph Holley^Captain Joseph Holley^^^^Bring 3 Marks of the Valiant to Captain Joseph Holley at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^The grand melee is the most important of the tournament's competitions. The people of Stormwind adore their knights and are looking forward to seeing us win the melee. To that end, they've been honing their skills against the other valiants. I suggest you do the same. Go to the stables outside the pavilion, equip your lance, mount the stabled Elwynn steed, and challenge the valiants. They wait in the Alliance Valiants' Ring just outside our tent. A Blade Fit For A Champion^80^Alliance^Argent Tournament^Arcanist Taelis^Arcanist Taelis^^^^Retrieve the Ashwood Brand and bring it to Arcanist Taelis at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Some of the champions believe an ancient weapon born of Northrend will bring them luck in the tourney. I have agreed to help them search for these weapons. There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded.

Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch. If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells -- those are the ones that will hatch venomhides. If you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its hatchling, with my guidance.Hungry, Hungry Hatchling^53^Orc, Blood Elf^Un'Goro Crater^Venomhide Hatchling^Venomhide Hatchling^^^^Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 15 pieces of Fresh Dinosaur Meat.^The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of diemetradons, stegodons, and pterrordaxes. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion. Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in Un'Goro Crater and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling.Gorishi Grub^53^Orc, Blood Elf^Un'Goro Crater^Venomhide Hatchling^Venomhide Hatchling^^^^Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 10 Silithid Meat.^The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt. The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the gorishi silithids. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips. It must want you to go to the Slithering Scar, in center of the southern part of Un'Goro Crater, and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling.Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw?^53^Orc, Blood Elf^Un'Goro Crater^Venomhide Hatchling^Venomhide Hatchling^^^^Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to feed it 12 Silithid Eggs.^The venomhide hatchling's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles. They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants.Searing Roc Feathers^53^Orc, Blood Elf^Un'Goro Crater^Venomhide Hatchling^Venomhide Hatchling^^^^Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to get 5 pieces of Searing Roc Plumage.^The hatchling looks at you for a moment, almost as if wondering whether you'll understand. It scrawls a picture of a pair of feathers in the dirt, then points with one claw to the bindings at its elbows and knees. It doesn't seem hungry, but what could the feathers be for? It must want them for adornments like the ones you've seen on other raptors. The largest feathers come from the searing rocs that congregate around the bones of large creatures in western Tanaris, northeast of Thistleshrub Valley.They Grow Up So Fast^53^All^Un'Goro Crater^Mor'vek^Mor'vek^Toxic Tolerance^^^Return 20 Venomhide Baby Teeth, the Venomhide Hatchling, 20 Runecloth, 20 Rugged Leather, and 80 gold to Mor'vek in the southeastern part of the Marshlands in Un'Goro Crater.^With your expert feeding and care, your venomhide hatchling will grow quickly. As they grow, their hatchling teeth will be replaced by adult teeth. If you keep the teeth shed by your hatchling as it grows, you'll have an easy way to tell when it's mature enough to be trained as a mount. Your venomhide will let you know what it needs, so pay close attention. When it has shed all of its baby teeth, return to me with your venomhide and the materials for your saddle and I'll do the rest.Searing Roc Feathers^53^Undead, Tauren,^Un'Goro Crater^Venomhide Hatchling^Venomhide Hatchling^^^^Your Venomhide Hatchling wants you to get 5 pieces of Searing Roc Plumage.^The hatchling looks at you for a moment, almost as if wondering whether you'll understand.

We're holding out, but not everyone has gone unscathed. A warrior in our band, Aponi Brightmane, was taken ill by an infected wound in her arm. She's been taken back to Thunder Bluff for recuperation. It seems she left her shield here at the front in the confusion, however - could you take it to her, along with our well-wishes? Her smile is missed around here. You can find her on Elder Rise on the Bluff.The Black Knight's Curse^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^^The Black Knight's Fall^The Black Knight's Fate^Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to investigate the Black Knight's Grave.^I wanted to remove the Black Knight's remains from the tournament grounds after your victory, but Confessor Paletress insisted that he receive a decent burial. Ever since, a dark presence has lingered in the cemetery and people are afraid to go there to visit the fallen. Would you visit the cemetery just past the eastern end of the tournament grounds and see if you can discover what's happening?The Black Knight's Fate^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Rhydalla^Crusader Rhydalla^^The Black Knight's Curse^^Capture Doctor Kolher's Orders at Deathspeaker's Watch, then return to Crusader Rhydalla at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^You said the body was taken by cultists? I can only think of one place they would have gone, Deathspeaker's Watch, the encampment on the rise west of the tournament grounds. Whatever the cultists are doing must be stopped. The rumors I've heard can only be true, then. The infamous Doctor Kohler must be among the cultists, practicing his arts. Look for a rise or an altar overlooking the cultist camp, slay the doctor, and look for proof of his plans. Slow down his work in any other way you can.A Leg Up^80^All^Argent Tournament^Narasi Snowdawn^Narasi Snowdawn^^^^Recover 10 Stolen Tallstrider Legs for Narasi Snowdawn at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^The Argent Crusade dispatched a fast ship carrying tallstrider meat and other supplies for us here at the tournament grounds, but it never arrived. Scouts reported seeing it attacked by the kvaldir, fearsome vrykul raiders who roam the seas. They've slain the crew and taken the cargo to an island called Hrothgar's Landing. If you look to the north, you can see it shrouded in the mist. Would you help us in recovering the stolen supplies? Without those tallstrider legs, we'll soon be out of food.Breakfast Of Champions^80^All^Argent Tournament^Savinia Loresong^Savinia Loresong^^^^Acquire 4 Jormungar Egg Sacs and bring them to Savinia Loresong at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Now that the coliseum is complete, the Argent Crusade has asked us to help look after the creatures that champions will be fighting. The giant jormungar have perhaps the strangest diet; they grow strong by eating the eggs of their own kind and the best eggs come from deep jormungar. Take this drum to the Foot Steppes in central Storm Peaks and play them near the snow mounds you see there. Rouse the deep jormungar, kill them, and gather their egg sacs.The Light's Mercy^80^All^Argent Tournament^Narasi Snowdawn^Narasi Snowdawn^^^^Use the Confessor's Prayer Book to perform last rites for 8 Slain Tualiq Villagers and then return to Narasi Snowdawn at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^I've been listening to Confessor Paletress speak, and I must tell you, her words have given me much to consider. It is not enough to fight beside the crusaders; we must take up their mission. Off the north coast is Hrothgar's Landing, where the seagoing Kvaldir have overrun an old tuskarr settlement and slain the villagers. Take this book and read the rites for the dead near the corpses of the villagers. It will allow their spirits to escape the mists engulfing the island and find peace.Learn to Ride in Elwynn Forest^20^All^Elwynn Forest^Riding Training Pamphlet^Randal Hunter^^^^Return the pamphlet to Randal Hunter at Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn Forest.^This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Randal Hunter.

If they are allowed to get a foothold there, there is no doubt that we will be their next target. The crusade's forces have their hands full dealing with the Scourge, and we must defend the tournament grounds. Fly north from the grounds until you reach the island and take on the Kvaldir before they can destroy anything else.Learn to Ride in the Eversong Woods^20^All^Eversong Woods^Riding Training Pamphlet^Perascamin^^^^Return the pamphlet to Perascamin at Thuron's Livery in Silvermoon City.^This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Perascamin.

It howls for hours about being without its favorite snobold. If the Argent Crusade didn't wish to use this monster in the coliseum, I'd slay it myself. Perhaps it's time to bring the beast its playthings. Take this net and travel to Garm's Bane in southeast Storm Peaks. It's just northeast of K3. Capture some of those snobolds and pray to the Light you've found the right one.Breakfast Of Champions^80^All^Argent Tournament^Tylos Dawnrunner^Tylos Dawnrunner^^^^Acquire 4 Jormungar Egg Sacs and bring them to Tylos Dawnrunner at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Now that the coliseum is complete, the Argent Crusade has asked us to help look after the creatures that champions will be fighting. The giant jormungar have perhaps the strangest diet; they grow strong by eating the eggs of their own kind and the best eggs come from deep jormungar. Take this drum to the Foot Steppes in central Storm Peaks and play them near the snow mounds you see there. The sound will rouse the deep jormungar. Kill them, collect their egg sacs, and return to the tournament grounds.Identifying the Remains^80^All^Argent Tournament^Kraken Tooth^Crusader Silverdawn^^^^Take the Kraken Tooth to Crusader Silverdawn as proof of your victory.^A whole tooth from a dead Kraken is a rare find indeed. Crusader Silverdawn will want to see this.You've Really Done It This Time, Kul^80^All^Argent Tournament^Narasi Snowdawn^Narasi Snowdawn^^^^Rescue Kul the Reckless and 4 Captive Aspirants from Deathspeaker's Watch and return to Narasi Snowdawn at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Crusader Kul has gone and gotten himself into trouble again, only this time he's not alone. When he saw the cultists making camp at Deathspeaker's Watch, west of the tournament grounds, Kul gathered the aspirants for an assault. Without reinforcements, Kul and his followers were easily captured. I have no doubt that the cult will sacrifice the prisoners unless we can mount a rescue. Any of those cultists could carry keys to the black cages. Find the keys and free Kul and the captive aspirants.Relic of the Earthen Ring^30^All^Shaman^Siln Skychaser^Gotura Fourwinds^^^^Bring your four totems to Gotura Fourwinds in Orgrimmar.^You have progressed far in your training, <name>. Now that you have mastered the four basic elements, you must strive to keep all four in balance. There is a practical benefit to this discipline - with practice, you may carry only a single relic instead of all four totems. Speak to Gotura Fourwinds at the Valley of Wisdom in Orgrimmar, and hone your mastery of the elements.Drottinn Hrothgar^80^All^Argent Tournament^High Crusader Adelard^High Crusader Adelard^^^^High Crusader Adelard at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to defeat Drottinn Hrothgar.^The kvaldir, seafaring vrykul who raid ships and coastal settlements, have overrun a tuskarr island across the strait to the north. Their leader is a veteran raider, Drottinn Hrothgar, who seeks to control these seas. With him in power, our shipments and troop transports will never be safe. We will be stranded here at the Lich King's mercy. Take this captured kvaldir war horn to the circle of tuskarr statues on the northeastern part of Hrothgar's Landing and use it to challenge the kvaldir leader.Mistcaller Yngvar^80^All^Argent Tournament^High Crusader Adelard^High Crusader Adelard^^^^High Crusader Adelard at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to kill Mistcaller Yngvar.^The Kvaldir have returned to the coasts of Northrend and if left unchecked, they will prevent our supplies and reinforcements from arriving. One of them, known as Mistcaller Yngvar, has taken up residence in a cave on the western side of Hrothgar's Landing. There, he manipulates the mists to conceal the Kvaldir and the sea beasts they command. Take this charm and travel across the strait north of the tournament grounds, to Hrothgar's Landing. Find the mistcaller's cave and use the charm to reveal him.Ornolf The Scarred^80^All^Argent Tournament^High Crusader Adelard^High Crusader Adelard^^^^High Crusader Adelard at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to kill Ornolf the Scarred.^Ornolf the Scarred is a fearsome raider renowned among his Kvaldir brethren for raiding and capturing ships. From aboard Bor's Fury, he and his crew attack our ships and steal our goods. Ornolf and his men are among those who slaughtered the inhabitants of a tuskarr island to the north and renamed it Hrothgar's Landing. His ship sits at anchor at the eastern end of the island's harbor. Take this captured banner and display it on his ship to provoke him into facing you in battle.Deathspeaker Kharos^80^All^Argent Tournament^High Crusader Adelard^High Crusader Adelard^^^^High Crusader Adelard at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants to you kill Deathspeaker Kharos.^The Cult of the Damned has redoubled its efforts to see us destroyed. They have grown bold and are massing their strength at Deathspeaker's Watch on the ridge west of the tournament grounds. The ruthless Deathspeaker Kharos has his men fortifying their positions, preparing to unleash all of the cult's weapons. My men are preparing themselves and the valiants to defend the grounds, but I want champions like you, <name>, to lead our efforts to blunt the attack. Find Deathspeaker Kharos and slay him.The Fate Of The Fallen^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Silverdawn^Crusader Silverdawn^^^^Crusader Silverdawn wants you to bring peace to 6 Fallen Hero's Spirits.^The Argent Crusade is hardly the first force to challenge the Lich King. Our enemy turns spirits of the fallen against us. Their spirits wander the Valley of Fallen Heroes, southwest of the grounds and between Aldur'thar and the Ironwall Rampart. The area is littered with discarded soul crystals, used by the Scourge to control the spirits. Gather those soul crystals and use them with this Light-blessed relic to bestow the blessing of peace upon the spirits. They have more than earned their rest.Get Kraken!^80^All^Argent Tournament^Crusader Silverdawn^Crusader Silverdawn^^^^Crusader Silverdawn wants you to mount an Argent Hippogryph, throw 6 Flaming Spears at the North Sea Kraken and take out 3 Vrykul Deepcallers.^The Sunreavers and Silver Covenant sent ships north to engage the Kvaldir at Hrothgar's Landing, but were intercepted and detained by a Kvaldir Raiding vessel. To make matters worse, the Kvaldir have found a way to call forth the dreaded Kraken that lives beneath the North Sea. If anyone on board is to get out alive, that Kraken must be driven away and the Kvaldir's summoning ritual ... disrupted. Crusader, take these spears and an Argent Hippogryph will take you to the battle.Relic of the Earthen Ring^30^All^Shaman^Sulaa^Farseer Eannu^^^^Bring your four totems to Farseer Eannu in Ironforge.^You have progressed far in your training, <name>. Now that you have mastered the four basic elements, you must strive to keep all four in balance. There is a practical benefit to this discipline - with practice, you may carry only a single relic instead of all four totems. Speak to Farseer Eannu near the Great Forge in Ironforge. He will help you hone your mastery of the elements.What Do You Feed a Yeti, Anyway?^80^All^Argent Tournament^Savinia Loresong^Savinia Loresong^^^^Savinia Loresong at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to bring her 3 pieces of North Sea Shark Meat.^The crusaders have captured a yeti that they're calling Icehowl. He's to be a participant in the coliseum battles and we've been asked to help with his training and upkeep. The crusaders weren't fond of my suggestion that we feed the beast surplus Sunreavers. The creature has a predilection for shark meat, so I want you to fly down to the Silver Blade, floating in the strait to the north. Get some fresh chum from one of the buckets on the boat, then spread it in the water to attract sharks.Rescue at Sea^80^All^Argent Tournament^Girana the Blooded^Girana the Blooded^^^^Girana the Blooded at the Argent Tournament Grounds would like you to kill 8 Kvaldir Berserkers and 3 Kvaldir Harpooners aboard The Firehawk.^The Kvaldir have set up camp at Hrothgar's Landing, the small island to the North. We sent Captain Aerthas Firehawk to the area, but they ran into a Kvaldir Raiding party heading to the Tournament Grounds! The Firehawk is now under attack by the raiders and is vastly outnumbered. Get out there and show those Kvaldir why attacking the Sunreavers is a poor plan indeed. The Firehawk is between Hrothgar's Landing to the north and the Tournament Grounds, on the western side of The Sea Reaver's Run.Stop The Aggressors^80^All^Argent Tournament^Girana the Blooded^Girana the Blooded^^^^Giranan the Blooded at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to kill 10 Kvaldir.^The Kvaldir, fearsome vrykul raiders, have disrupted our shipments and murdered the tuskarr inhabitants of an island to the north, renaming it Hrothgar's Landing. If they are allowed to get a foothold there, there is no doubt that we will be their next target. The crusade's forces have their hands full dealing with the Scourge, and we must defend the tournament grounds. Fly north from the grounds until you reach the island and take on the Kvaldir before they can destroy anything else.Gormok Wants His Snobolds^80^All^Argent Tournament^Tylos Dawnrunner^Tylos Dawnrunner^^^^Use the Weighted Net to capture 8 Snowblind Followers and bring them to Tylos Dawnrunner at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Two of my men have already been killed trying to confine the magnataur called Gormok the Impaler, yet the creature still rages. It howls for hours about being without its favorite snobold. If the Argent Crusade didn't wish to use this monster in the coliseum, I'd slay it myself. Perhaps it's time to bring the beast its playthings. Take this net and travel to Garm's Bane in southeast Storm Peaks. It's just northeast of K3. Capture some of those snobolds and pray to the Light you've found the right one.You've Really Done It This Time, Kul^80^All^Argent Tournament^Girana the Blooded^Girana the Blooded^^^^Rescue Kul the Reckless and 4 Captive Aspirants from Deathspeaker's Watch and return to Girana the Blooded at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Crusader Kul has gone and gotten himself into trouble again, only this time he's not alone. When he saw the cultists making camp at Deathspeaker's Watch, west of the tourney grounds, Kul gathered the aspirants for an attack. They were easily captured, and now Kul languishes in a cage on the platform in the camp. I am sure that the cult will sacrifice the prisoners unless we can rescue them. Any of those cultists could carry keys to the black cages. Find the keys and free Kul and the captive aspirants.A Leg Up^80^All^Argent Tournament^Girana the Blooded^Girana the Blooded^^^^Recover 10 Stolen Tallstrider Legs for Girana the Blooded at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^The Argent Crusade dispatched a fast ship carrying tallstrider meat and other supplies for us here at the tournament grounds, but it never arrived.

We fight beside the crusaders, but we can learn from them, too. Off the north coast is Hrothgar's Landing, where the seagoing Kvaldir have overrun an old tuskarr settlement and slain the villagers. Take this book and read the rites for the dead near the corpses of the villagers. It will allow their spirits to escape the mists engulfing the island and find peace.What Do You Feed a Yeti, Anyway?^80^All^Argent Tournament^Tylos Dawnrunner^Tylos Dawnrunner^^^^Tylos Dawnrunner at the Argent Tournament Grounds wants you to bring him 3 pieces of North Sea Shark Meat.^The crusaders have captured a yeti that they're calling Icehowl. He's to be a participant in the coliseum battles and we've been asked to help with his training and upkeep. The crusaders weren't fond of my suggestion that we feed some Silver Covenant members to the beast. The creature prefers shark meat, so I want you to fly down to the Crimson Dawn, floating in the strait to the north. Get some fresh chum from one of the buckets on the boat, then spread it in the water to attract sharks.Cardinal Ruby^65^All^Alchemy^Linzy Blackbolt^Linzy Blackbolt^^^^Linzy Blackbolt in Dalaran wants you to successfully transmute 5 epic gems with your alchemy skill. Acceptable transmutes include Ametrine, Eye of Zul, Dreadstone, King's Amber, and Majestic Zircon.^The Cardinal Ruby is said to be the finest gem in all of Northrend. It sparkles like a crystal rose under the sun. Before I teach you this recipe, I ask that you perform five epic gem transmutes to prepare your mind. You can do any you like, and even do the same transmute many times. Return to me when you are truly ready.Rescue at Sea^80^All^Argent Tournament^Narasi Snowdawn^Narasi Snowdawn^^^^Head out to The North Sea and kill 8 Vrykul Berserkers and 3 Vrykul Harpooners attacking The Wavecrest.^Champion, Captain Wavecrest and her ship were sent north to disrupt the Kvaldir in Hrothgar's Landing when they were intercepted by a Kvaldir raiding party headed to the Tournament Grounds. Unfortunately, the Kvaldir far outnumber the crew on board and are slowly taking over the ship. We need you to go north to The Wavecrest in The Sea Reaver's Run, between the Tournament Grounds and Hrothgar's Landing and help the crew fend off the attack. You should see the ship on the east side of the pass.Writ of Merit^1^All^Jewelcrafting^Writ of Merit^Timothy Jones^^^^Deliver the Writ of Merit to Timothy Jones in Dalaran.^This fine parchment lists a great many accomplishments, achieved by <name>, in the tradition of jewelcrafting. Return this writ to Timothy Jones in Dalaran for a proper reward.Waterlogged Recipe^80^All^Dalaran^Waterlogged Recipe^Christi Stockton^^^^Bring the Waterlogged Recipe to Christi Stockton in the Dalaran city.^This appears to be the remains of a mixture for potent wine.

Sylvanas herself has requested that I send my most 'capable' agents back to the Undercity for a highly sensitive tactical operation. Unfortunately, my most capable agents were killed over three years ago. In their stead I have a collection of brain dead riff-raff. <Nathanos stares coldly at you.> Travel to the Undercity at once and report to the Dark Lady. Do not embarrass me, <class>!The Crimson Courier^60^Horde^Eastern Plaguelands^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Nathanos Blightcaller^The Call to Command^^^Return to Eastern Plaguelands and track down the Crimson Courier. Kill the Courier and recover the Grand Crusader's Command.^We cannot attack the Scarlet Crusade's command directly; they are too well defended. But there's more than one way to skin a cat. They'll be nothing without their main force. The Deathstalkers have been collecting data on the activity of the Crusade outside of Stratholme. Each day, a report is sent from their central command to Tyr's Hand. This report is the key, <race>! Find the Crimson Courier and recover that report. Bring it to Nathanos.Battle of Hillsbrad^32^Horde^Hillsbrad Foothills^High Executor Darthalia^Bragor Bloodfist^Battle of Hillsbrad^^^Take Darthalia's Sealed Commendation to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity.^Because you fought with such valor and perseverance in the Battle of Hillsbrad, I have written this commendation, extolling your heroics in combat for the high command to recognize. Take this sealed commendation to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity. Go with pride, <class>.An Unholy Alliance^36^Horde^Razorfen Downs^Small Scroll^Bragor Bloodfist^An Unholy Alliance^^^Take the Small Scroll to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity.^My Lady, You know very well what it is we are offering. The opportunity for you to take the Barrens and the lands beyond is a great one. We simply want your aid in return. By aid we mean nothing more than your giving us the freedom to take action in the area. Please, allow us to discuss this further. We have great power and are willing to share with those wise enough to join us. I will remain outside Razorfen Downs for the time being. Best Regards,Ambassador MalcinAn Unholy Alliance^36^Horde^Razorfen Downs^Bragor Bloodfist^Bragor Bloodfist^An Unholy Alliance^^^Bring Ambassador Malcin's Head to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity.^Supposedly this Malcin is outside Razorfen Downs. There's no question - he has to die. My contacts in Orgrimmar tell me their scouts have found signs of the Plague down there. The quilboar are showing signs of being plagued, too; they're much more powerful. Whatever the Scourge are doing down there needs to end. Now. Find this Malcin and kill him. Report back here when he's dead.Into The Scarlet Monastery^42^Horde^Scarlet Monastery^Bragor Bloodfist^Bragor Bloodfist^^^^Kill High Inquisitor Whitemane, Scarlet Commander Mograine, Herod, the Scarlet Champion and Houndmaster Loksey and then report back to Bragor Bloodfist in the Undercity.^One of my duties while I'm stationed here is to help the Forsaken take care of their borders, and that, <class>, is exactly what you're going to do for me. I might live and breathe, but the Scarlet Crusade will cut down my people as quickly as they will one of the undead. They're a problem here, a big one, and you're going to do something about it. Go to the Monastery and slay High Inquisitor Whitemane and her lieutenants.The Power to Destroy...^16^Horde^Ragefire Chasm^Bragor Bloodfist^Bragor Bloodfist^^^^Bring the books Spells of Shadow and Incantations from the Nether to Bragor Bloodfist in Undercity.^Listen up, <class>. You may not know this, but Orgrimmar's got a problem. Deep in Ragefire Chasm, a sect of the Shadow Council called the Searing Blade performs their sinister work. They're mainly orcs, and I can't trust sensitive information in the hands of the grunts there. That's where you come in. They should have two books in their possession. I want them kept out of the hands of the Searing Blade and the Forsaken alike. Bring them to me directly.A Cautious Return^73^All^Darnassus^Daros Moonlance^Archmage Mordent Evenshade^^^^Bring Daros' Journal to Mordent Evenshade in Darnassus.^A moment of your time, <class>. Change is coming. It has drawn us out of the ruins of Eldre'Thalas and into the wide world once more. I have come to research this city and cannot stray from it, but if you are inclined, I have an errand for you. My colleague set out for Darnassus to speak with the High Priestess there, that we might come to an understanding. Take this journal to Mordent Evenshade in the temple. It may help in his diplomacy mission.The Deathstalkers^13^Horde^Rogue^Mennet Carkad^Aleric Hawkins^The Deathstalkers^^^Deliver Andron's Ledger to Aleric Hawkins in the Hall of the Dark Lady in the Undercity.^The Syndicate? I would never have suspected. It seems the lords of Alterac have fallen far in the years since their betrayal. Hawkins will be pleased to learn of this, and as you were so instrumental in this discovery, it would be fitting if you were the one to deliver it to him. Ah, and how could I forget? Welcome to the Deathstalkers.The Deathstalkers^13^Horde^Rogue^Mennet Carkad^Andron Gant^Mennet Carkad^^^Speak with Andron Gant in the Undercity.^The letter of introduction should be enough to convince Andron that you are the messenger he's been waiting for. I've met Andron before, he doesn't quite have the mental capacity to be that suspicious. Our leader suspects that Andron has been providing aid to some other group. He wishes to know what organization this is and requires proof of it. I want you to speak with Andron, and obtain this information. You'll find him at his shop near the Apothecarium.The Deathstalkers^13^Horde^Rogue^Mennet Carkad^Mennet Carkad^The Deathstalkers^Mennet Carkad^^Get Astor's Letter of Introduction and return it to Mennet Carkad in the Rogues' Quarter.^If you wish to join the Deathstalkers, the Dark Lady's elite guard, you will have to prove your worth. I will not lie to you, <name>, this task could mean your death. I have some things that need attending to. I require the personal effects of Astor Hadren, a messenger who travels between Silverpine and the Undercity. I will leave the method of procurement to your discretion. It will be better for you if you know less of the nature of this business. Succeed and I shall tell you more.The Deathstalkers^13^Horde^Rogue^Andron Gant^Mennet Carkad^The Deathstalkers^^^Bring Andron's Ledger to Mennet Carkad in the Rogues' Quarter of Undercity.^You'll find the ledger with the information your employers seek on the bookshelf behind me. Deliver it with my regards, and tell them that I would prefer it if they sent you, if they find enough value that they should wish to continue our arrangement.The Battered Hilt^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Battered Hilt^Caladis Brightspear^The Battered Hilt^^^Bring the Battered Hilt to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.^This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art. The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the Silver Covenant members would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representative at Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.What The Dragons Know^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Caladis Brightspear^Arcanist Tybalin^The Battered Hilt^^^Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple.^There's no mistaking it - this hilt comes from a powerful, ancient weapon, but which one? I do not recall seeing or hearing of a sword with these markings, but that doesn't mean that all is lost. Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the quel'dorei and the Kirin Tor. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to Arcanist Tybalin inside the Silver Enclave in Dalaran.The Sunreaver Plan^80^Alliance^Dalaran^Arcanist Tybalin^Arcanist Tybalin^The Battered Hilt^^^Obtain the Sunreaver Orders.^One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Sunreaver agent buying reagents from a dealer in the Black Market area. The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on down in the sewers, so that's a big indication that they're planning something. Head into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let them get it back to Icecrown first.A Suitable Disguise^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Arcanist Tybalin^Arcanist Tybalin^The Battered Hilt^^^Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Glossgleam.^Getting you inside the Sunreaver's Sanctuary will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Sunreaver tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work. On the balcony above Threads of Fate, you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while.A Meeting With The Magister^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Arcanist Tybalin^Arcanist Tybalin^The Battered Hilt^^^Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from Magister Hathorel.^I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Sunreaver Sanctuary's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way into The Filthy Animal and meet up with the Sunreaver contact there, one Magister Hathorel. Obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest while your disguise holds, and return it to me.A Most Puzzling Circumstance^80^All^Stormwind City^Head of Onyxia^Zardeth of the Black Claw^^^^Take the Head of Onyxia to Zardeth of the Black Claw in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb.^You have accomplished the truly impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Seize her head and deliver it to Zardeth of the Black Claw.A Most Puzzling Circumstance^80^All^Orgrimmar^Head of Onyxia^Neeru Fireblade^^^^Take the Head of Onyxia to Neeru Fireblade in the Cleft of Shadow.^You have accomplished the truly impossible. The brood mother of the Black Dragonflight lies dead at your feet. Seize her head and deliver it to Neeru Fireblade.Waterlogged Recipe^80^All^Dalaran^Waterlogged Recipe^Christi Stockton^^^^Bring the Waterlogged Recipe to Christi Stockton in the Dalaran city.^This appears to be the remains of a mixture for potent wine. Perhaps the proprietor of One More Glass in Dalaran would be interested in it....Battle Plans Of The Kvaldir^80^All^Hrothgar's Landing^Kvaldir Attack Plans^Justicar Mariel Trueheart^^^^Recover the Heart of the Mists and bring it and the Kvaldir Attack Plans to Justicar Mariel Trueheart at the Argent Tournament Grounds.^Looking over the captured attack plans, you find a map of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor with major settlements marked. Reading over the orders, you learn that Kvaldir captains have drafted plans for a series of devastating raids. According to the orders, the attacks are to begin after Mistcaller Yngvar "consults the Heart of the Mists." Perhaps you could delay the attacks by capturing the omen from the Mistcaller's Cave on the western side of Hrothgar's Landing and notify Justicar Mariel Trueheart.An Audience With The Arcanist^80^Horde^Icecrown^Magister Hathorel^Magister Hathorel^The Battered Hilt^^^Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from Arcanist Tybalin.^I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Silver Enclave's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way up to the top level of the Silver Enclave and meet up with the Silver Covenant's man there, known as Arcanist Tybalin. While disguised, obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest, and return the book to me.Return To Caladis Brightspear^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Arcanist Tybalin^Caladis Brightspear^The Battered Hilt^^Reforging The Sword^Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.^We must get this book to Caladis Brightspear immediately. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at keeping the Sunreavers at bay. Take it with you to Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Caladis and the sword will be waiting. The sooner we can identify the blade, the sooner we can claim it.Reforging The Sword^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Caladis Brightspear^Caladis Brightspear^Reforging The Sword^Return To Caladis Brightspear^^Obtain 5 Infused Saronite Bars and the Forgemaster's Hammer and use them to make the Reforged Quel'Delar.^We cannot allow Quel'Delar to remain broken and disgraced. Take the remnants of the sword, along with the battered hilt you discovered, and venture into the Pit of Saron within Icecrown Citadel. In the pit, the Lich King uses slaves to mine, process, and transform saronite ore. This infused saronite is what we will use to rebuild Quel'Delar. You must gather bars of infused saronite and capture the forgemaster's hammer, then bring them to the forgemaster's anvil and reforge the sword.Tempering The Blade^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Caladis Brightspear^Caladis Brightspear^Reforging The Sword^^^Temper the Reforged Quel'Delar in the Crucible of Souls.^At last, the pieces of Quel'Delar are rejoined and the blade is whole, but it cannot see battle until you have tempered it. That jagged saronite edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything. Deep in Icecrown Citadel's Forge of Souls is a place where the blade can safely be tempered. Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the Devourer of Souls and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me in The Frozen Halls.The Halls Of Reflection^80^Alliance^Icecrown^Caladis Brightspear^Caladis Brightspear^Reforging The Sword^^^Bring your Tempered Quel'Delar to Sword's Rest inside the Halls of Reflection.^You have reforged and tempered the sword, yet it sits quietly in its sheath, showing no signs of the power it should possess. You say the sword pulls you, as though it possesses a will? Dare you bring it where it wishes to go? It's not right that the sword should be this silent and this insistent, yet I fear that if you do not take the sword to its destination, we will never learn why. Take it into Icecrown Citadel's Halls of Reflection, but be on your guard! I'll be waiting for you in The Frozen Halls.The Path to the Citadel^80^Alliance^Pit of Saron^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Martin Victus^Inside the Frozen Citadel^^^Free 15 Alliance Slaves and kill Forgemaster Garfrost.^They've put our captured soldiers to work in the quarry! Kill their captors and set them free, hero, and do it quickly. We will need their aid when we confront Scourgelord Tyrannus.Echoes of Tortured Souls^80^Alliance^The Forge of Souls^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Inside the Frozen Citadel^^^Kill Bronjahm and the Devourer of Souls to secure access to the Pit of Saron.^I cannot thank you enough for coming. We're severely undermanned to be risking a venture into the citadel, but opportunities like this are too rare to pass up. I'm awaiting the arrival of champions from the coliseum, but if your reputation holds true, you should be more than equipped to fight through the forge yourself. Clear the way to the far side and secure the passage to the Pit of Saron. We will need to hold it to move our men further into the citadel. Please hurry, <name>. We're counting on you.Wrath of the Lich King^80^Alliance^Valiance Expedition^Archmage Koreln^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^^Frostmourne^^Find Lady Jaina Proudmoore and escape the Halls of Reflection^Uther knew a great deal about how Arthas might be defeated. It's hard to believe that there is much hope of defeating Arthas upon the steps of his own throne. And who will take up the crown of Lich King if it comes to that? Many questions remain, but the answers that you've uncovered may be critical to ensuring Arthas' defeat. You need to find Jaina and escape the Lich King while there's still time.Inside the Frozen Citadel^80^Horde^The Forge of Souls^Dark Ranger Vorel^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Inside the Frozen Citadel^^^Enter The Forge of Souls from the side of Icecrown Citadel and locate Lady Sylvanas Windrunner.^<class>! Come close quickly, I must have a word! My queen, the Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, has uncovered a hole in the defenses of Icecrown Citadel into a place she referred to as "The Forge of Souls." She sent word before she left for me to find fierce fighters to send her way. I think you'll do. Go to her within the entrance to the forge, <class>.The Path to the Citadel^80^Horde^Pit of Saron^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Gorkun Ironskull^Inside the Frozen Citadel^^^Free 15 Horde Slaves and kill Forgemaster Garfrost.^They've put our captured soldiers to work in the quarry. Kill their captors and set them free, <class>, and do it quickly. We will need their aid when we confront Scourgelord Tyrannus.Inside the Frozen Citadel^80^Alliance^^Apprentice Nelphi^Lady Jaina Proudmoore^Inside the Frozen Citadel^^^Enter The Forge of Souls from the side of Icecrown Citadel and find Lady Jaina Proudmoore.^<class>! Come close quickly, I must have a word! My patron, the Lady Jaina Proudmoore, has uncovered a hole in the defenses of Icecrown Citadel into a place she referred to as "The Forge of Souls." She sent word before she left for me to find any help that I could... and, well, I was hoping that might be you. Please, find her there as soon as you can.Echoes of Tortured Souls^80^Horde^Warsong Offensive^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Lady Sylvanas Windrunner^Inside the Frozen Citadel^^^Kill Bronjahm and the Devourer of Souls to secure access to the Pit of Saron.^I'm glad we have someone capable to aid us in this. Delving into the citadel with so few is risky at best, but opportunities like this are too rare to pass up. I'm awaiting the arrival of champions from the coliseum, but if your reputation holds true, you should be more than equipped to fight through the forge yourself. Clear the way to the far side and secure the passage to the Pit of Saron. We will need to hold it to move our men further into the Citadel. Be quick about it, <name>. Time is short.Journey To The Sunwell^80^Alliance^Isle of Quel'Danas^Caladis Brightspear^Halduron Brightwing^Reforging The Sword^^^Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas.^Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword. The guardians of the Sunwell will not simply allow you to walk in, so you must find Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there.Thalorien Dawnseeker^80^Alliance^Isle of Quel'Danas^Halduron Brightwing^Halduron Brightwing^Reforging The Sword^^The Purification of Quel'Delar, The Purification of Quel'Delar^Visit Thalorien Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar.^If you truly bear Quel'Delar, <name>, I might be able to admit you to the Sunwell. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell.The Sacred and the Corrupt^80^All^Icecrown Citadel^Highlord Darion Mograine^Runeforge^^^Shadow's Edge^Place Light's Vengeance, 25 Primordial Saronite, Rotface's Acidic Blood, and Festergut's Acidic Blood in Highlord Mograine's runeforge in Icecrown Citadel.^It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, <race>, as it will likely end in your undoing. Ignore my counsel and embark on the endeavor, and I shall provide you with the knowledge and resources to see it through. You must return to Frostmourne Cavern and recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Reforged with saronite and etched with the acidic blood of the Lich King's abominations, it will provide the foundation for our work.A Feast of Souls^80^All^Icecrown Citadel^Highlord Darion Mograine^Highlord Darion Mograine^^Shadow's Edge^Unholy Infusion^Highlord Darion Mograine wants you to use Shadow's Edge to slay 1000 of the Lich King's minions in Icecrown Citadel. Souls can be obtained in 10 or 25 person difficulty.^Shadow's Edge is among the greatest weapons a <class> could hope to obtain. Is your lust for power sated, <race>? <You feel Mograine's penetrating gaze.> I thought not. A final warning then... You now embark on the most treacherous leg of your quest. Bridle your aspirations, for if your aims are impure then your life, your very soul, is forfeit. The weapon you hold is but an empty husk, a mere shadow of what it may become. Only by devouring a thousand souls shall its true potential be unlocked.The Splintered Throne^80^All^Icecrown Citadel^Highlord Darion Mograine^Highlord Darion Mograine^^Frost Infusion^Empowerment^Highlord Darion Mograine wants you to collect 50 Shadowfrost Shards.^The Lich King's throne once served as his prison. Kil'jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether, its sole purpose to hold Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit. When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner'zhul's soul, allowing it to merge with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel. I shall require those shards, held only by the Lich King's most powerful servants, to seal the power contained in your blade.The Battered Hilt^80^Horde^Icecrown^Battered Hilt^Myralion Sunblaze^The Battered Hilt^^^Bring the Battered Hilt to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.^This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art. The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the Sunreavers would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representatives at Quel'Delar's Rest, to the south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.What The Dragons Know^80^Horde^Icecrown^Myralion Sunblaze^Magister Hathorel^The Battered Hilt^^^Speak to Krasus at the top of Wyrmrest Temple.^There's no mistaking it - this hilt comes from a powerful, ancient weapon, but which one? I do not recognize these particular markings, but we haven't hit a dead end yet. Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the quel'dorei and the Kirin Tor. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to Magister Hathorel inside Sunreaver's Sanctuary in Dalaran.A Suitable Disguise^80^Horde^Icecrown^Magister Hathorel^Magister Hathorel^The Battered Hilt^^^Obtain a Borrowed Tabard from Shandy Glossgleam.^Getting you inside the Silver Enclave will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Silver Covenant tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work.

Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while.The Silver Covenant's Scheme^80^Horde^Dalaran^Magister Hathorel^Magister Hathorel^The Battered Hilt^^^Capture the Silver Covenant Orders.^One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something. Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do.Return To Myralion Sunblaze^80^Horde^Icecrown^Magister Hathorel^Myralion Sunblaze^The Battered Hilt^^Reforging The Sword^Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest.^We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the Silver Covenant's men. Take it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of Aethas Sunreaver and show Dalaran and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the Lich King.Reforging The Sword^80^Horde^Icecrown^Myralion Sunblaze^Myralion Sunblaze^Reforging The Sword^Return To Myralion Sunblaze^^Obtain 5 Infused Saronite Bars and the Forgemaster's Hammer, then combine them with the Remnants of Quel'Delar to create the Reforged Quel'Delar.^We cannot allow Quel'Delar to remain broken and disgraced. Take the remnants of the sword, along with the battered hilt you discovered, and venture into the Pit of Saron within Icecrown Citadel. In the pit, the Lich King uses slaves to mine, process, and transform saronite ore. This infused saronite is what we will use to rebuild Quel'Delar.

Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the Devourer of Souls and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me. I'll be waiting in The Frozen Halls.The Halls Of Reflection^80^Horde^Icecrown^Myralion Sunblaze^Myralion Sunblaze^Reforging The Sword^^^Bring Quel'Delar to Sword's Rest inside the Halls of Reflection.^You have re-forged and tempered the sword, yet it sits quietly in its sheath, little different from a mundane blade. You say the sword pulls you, as though it possesses a will? Dare you bring it where it wishes to go? It is not right that the sword should be this silent and this insistent, yet I fear that if you do not take the sword to its destination, we will never learn why. Bear it with you to Icecrown Citadel's Halls of Reflection, but be on your guard. I will wait for you in The Frozen Halls.Journey To The Sunwell^80^Horde^Isle of Quel'Danas^Myralion Sunblaze^Halduron Brightwing^Reforging The Sword^^^Speak with Halduron Brightwing at the entrance to the Sunwell Plateau on the Isle of Quel'Danas.^Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword. The guardians will try to stop you from entering the Sunwell Plateau, but make yourself known to Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there.Thalorien Dawnseeker^80^Horde^Isle of Quel'Danas^Halduron Brightwing^Halduron Brightwing^Reforging The Sword^^The Purification of Quel'Delar, The Purification of Quel'Delar, The Purification of Quel'Delar, The Purification of Quel'Delar^Visit Thalorien Dawnseeker's Remains and obtain his blessing to wield Quel'Delar.^You are the one working with Myralion Sunblaze, arent you? I know of a way we can test the sword. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell.Sartharion Must Die!^80^All^Dalaran^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Sartharion.^Sartharion, the Onyx Guardian, watches over the eggs of the Twilight Dragonflight.

The Council of Six has decreed that Sartharion must die!Anub'Rekhan Must Die!^80^All^Naxxramas^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Anub'Rekhan.^Anub'Rekhan, once-mighty Spider Lord of the nerubian empire, has been taken by the Lich King and corrupted into a state of undeath. Now a crypt lord, he sits in his parlor in the Arachnid Quarter of Naxxramas, spinning strategies for Kel'Thuzad. The Council of Six has decreed that Anub'Rekhan must die!Noth the Plaguebringer Must Die!^80^All^Naxxramas^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Noth the Plaguebringer.^Noth the Plaguebringer, traitor and coward! Second only to the Lich King himself for the number of souls that have been Scourged! Make haste to Naxxramas. You will find him within the Plague Quarter hiding behind his undead minions. Destroy him! The Council of Six has decreed that Noth must die!Instructor Razuvious Must Die!^80^All^Naxxramas^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Instructor Razuvious.^Instructor Razuvious smugly struts about the Military Quarter of Naxxramas.

The Council of Six has decreed that Razuvious must die!Patchwerk Must Die!^80^All^Naxxramas^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Patchwerk.^The so-called "avatar of war", Patchwerk is the ultimate abomination. It is also taking a heavy toll upon on our forces in the Dragonblight. I want you to assemble your companions and enter the Construct Quarter of Naxxramas. Disassemble the construct. The Council of Six has decreed that Patchwerk must die!Malygos Must Die!^80^All^The Eye of Eternity^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Malygos.^Our resources are strained.

The Council of Six has decreed that Malygos must die!Flame Leviathan Must Die!^80^All^Ulduar^Archmage Lan'dalock^Archmage Lan'dalock^^^^Kill Flame Leviathan.^Within the Formation Grounds sits Ulduar's first line of defense: Flame Leviathan. The Kirin Tor have been provided with information suggesting that this Keeper-created machine is soon to be transported to an undisclosed location and let loose to wreak havoc upon the mortals of Azeroth.
